We first\nshow that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or\nfor that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following\nTian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their\nproofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear\ncase, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop\ngradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we\nfinally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with\nthese two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no\nrisk of degenerating to trivial solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods, focusing on stop gradient and exponential moving average procedures to avoid representation collapse.

To address\nthis, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)\ndecomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers.
