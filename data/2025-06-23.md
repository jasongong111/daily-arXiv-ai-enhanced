### [1] [LLMs Struggle to Perform Counterfactual Reasoning with Parametric Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732)
*Khurram Yamin,Gaurav Ghosal,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often relying on parametric knowledge, and finetuning can degrade their stored knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can integrate in-context knowledge with parametric knowledge via counterfactual reasoning.

Method: Synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems.

Result: LLMs generally fail at counterfactual reasoning, defaulting to parametric knowledge, and finetuning worsens performance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in repurposing parametric knowledge in novel settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in
their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive
tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter
situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or
unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine
knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of
counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop
reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual
reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.
Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill
counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored
parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of
current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

### [2] [$\texttt{SPECS}$: Faster Test-Time Scaling through Speculative Drafts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15733)
*Mert Cemri,Nived Rajaraman,Rishabh Tiwari,Xiaoxuan Liu,Kurt Keutzer,Ion Stoica,Kannan Ramchandran,Ahmad Beirami,Ziteng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPECS is a latency-aware test-time scaling method for LLMs that balances accuracy and latency by using a smaller model for candidate generation and integrating reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods optimize for accuracy but overlook latency constraints, impacting user experience.

Method: SPECS uses a smaller model to generate candidates, evaluates them with a larger model and reward model, and introduces new integration strategies like soft verification and deferral.

Result: SPECS matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to 19.1% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SPECS effectively addresses the latency-accuracy trade-off in LLMs, with theoretical convergence to a KL-regularized RL objective.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating
additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased
compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly
impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize
for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking
latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a
latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding.
$\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences
efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger
target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration
strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based
deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench
datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy
while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows
that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement
learning objective with increasing beam width.

### [3] [The Safety Reminder: A Soft Prompt to Reactivate Delayed Safety Awareness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15734)
*Peiyuan Tang,Haojie Xin,Xiaodong Zhang,Jun Sun,Qin Xia,Zijiang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "The Safety Reminder," a soft prompt tuning method to enhance safety awareness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by reactivating their delayed safety mechanisms, reducing harmful content generation while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their multimodal nature, leading to harmful content generation despite safety alignments. The study aims to address this by leveraging the observed "delayed safety awareness" phenomenon.

Method: The authors propose "The Safety Reminder," a soft prompt tuning approach that injects learnable prompt tokens during text generation to proactively reactivate safety awareness when harmful content is detected.

Result: The method significantly reduces attack success rates across three safety benchmarks and one adversarial attack, while maintaining model performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: The Safety Reminder offers a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world applications by balancing safety and utility.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across
real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,
ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

### [4] [ContextBench: Modifying Contexts for Targeted Latent Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15735)
*Robert Graham,Edward Stevinson,Leo Richter,Alexander Chia,Joseph Miller,Joseph Isaac Bloom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextBench, a benchmark for evaluating methods that generate linguistically fluent inputs to trigger specific behaviors or latent features in language models, focusing on safety applications. It enhances Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify inputs that activate specific behaviors or latent features in language models for safety use cases.

Method: Formalizes context modification, introduces ContextBench, and enhances EPO with LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting.

Result: The enhanced EPO variants outperform current methods in balancing elicitation effectiveness and fluency.

Conclusion: The approach advances the capability to generate targeted, fluent inputs for safety applications, though challenges remain in balancing objectives.

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in
language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a
class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs
that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise
this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark
with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety
applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength
(activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency,
highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these
objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with
LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these
variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation
effectiveness and fluency.

### [5] [SHADE-Arena: Evaluating Sabotage and Monitoring in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15740)
*Jonathan Kutasov,Yuqi Sun,Paul Colognese,Teun van der Weij,Linda Petrini,Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,John Hughes,Xiang Deng,Henry Sleight,Tyler Tracy,Buck Shlegeris,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to pursue hidden harmful objectives while completing tasks, using SHADE-Arena. Top models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro show limited sabotage success (27% and 15%), but monitoring remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risk of LLMs acting as autonomous agents with hidden harmful goals, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Uses SHADE-Arena, a diverse dataset with benign main tasks and harmful side objectives, to evaluate LLMs' sabotage and monitoring capabilities.

Result: Best models achieve 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) sabotage success. Monitoring is difficult, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving 0.87 AUC.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with long-context sabotage but monitoring subtle harmful behavior is already challenging, likely worsening with more complex tasks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their
ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability
of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while
completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of
frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena,
the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring
capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign
main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are
evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing
suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the
main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that
the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For
current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having
access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use
SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign
transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to
failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already
demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we
expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of standardization in Agentic AI research, introduces a robust evaluation protocol, and presents OAgents, a modular framework achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent research lacks standardization and rigor, hindering fair comparisons and progress measurement.

Method: A systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to evaluate design choices in agent components.

Result: Identified key components for effective agents, introduced a stable evaluation protocol, and developed OAgents, a top-performing modular framework.

Conclusion: OAgents advances Agentic AI research by providing a reproducible, modular foundation for future work.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

### [7] [Sysformer: Safeguarding Frozen Large Language Models with Adaptive System Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15751)
*Kartik Sharma,Yiqiao Jin,Vineeth Rakesh,Yingtong Dou,Menghai Pan,Mahashweta Das,Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sysformer, a transformer-based method to adapt system prompts in LLMs for improved safety, achieving significant gains in refusal rates for harmful prompts and compliance for safe ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' failures in distinguishing safe behaviors, avoiding costly fine-tuning or suboptimal heuristics.

Method: Proposes Sysformer, which updates system prompts in the LLM input embedding space while keeping LLM parameters frozen, trained to refuse harmful prompts and comply with safe ones.

Result: Demonstrates up to 80% gain in refusal rates for harmful prompts, 90% compliance for safe ones, and 100% robustness against jailbreaking attacks.

Conclusion: Sysformer offers a cost-effective way to safeguard LLMs and encourages future work on variable system prompts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it
is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior
research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe
behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the
generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to
improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of
model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we
take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts
in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a
fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt
to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we
propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an
initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM
input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM
parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of
harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through
extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent
benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the
robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful
prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$.
Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs
upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our
findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future
investigations into designing variable system prompts.

### [8] [Linear-Time Primitives for Algorithm Development in Graphical Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15758)
*Marcel Wienöbst,Sebastian Weichwald,Leonard Henckel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIfly is a framework for efficient causal inference by reducing tasks to reachability in state-space graphs, offering linear-time performance and outperforming traditional methods like moralization and latent projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable and efficient alternative to existing causal inference primitives, which are computationally intensive.

Method: Uses reachability in state-space graphs, formalized via rule tables, with a Rust implementation for high performance.

Result: Demonstrates linear-time efficiency, outperforms moralization and latent projection, and supports new algorithms like instrumental variables.

Conclusion: CIfly is a flexible, scalable backbone for causal inference, enabling efficient algorithm development and deployment.

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in
graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core
operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be
reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be
constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for
specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish
CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and
latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean
matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table
text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance
execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by
re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the
framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These
contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical
causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient
deployment.

### [9] [Advancing Stochastic 3-SAT Solvers by Dissipating Oversatisfied Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15774)
*J. Schwardt,J. C. Budich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOCSAT, a new stochastic local search heuristic for 3-SAT, outperforms existing solvers by addressing oversatisfied constraints, outperforming WalkSAT and Kissat on hard instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers like WalkSAT struggle with local minima due to oversatisfied constraints in hard 3-SAT instances.

Method: DOCSAT dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC) to reduce their abundance and avoid local minima.

Result: DOCSAT outperforms WalkSAT and Kissat, especially on the hardest quintile of instances up to N=15000.

Conclusion: DOCSAT's approach of leveraging statistical structure beyond the primary cost function can generalize to other optimization problems.

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the
NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing
solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our
construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous
approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are
distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied
combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,
coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their
unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark
our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT
instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find
that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including
the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the
hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.
The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure
beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape
local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for
generalization to other optimization problems.

### [10] [SLR: An Automated Synthesis Framework for Scalable Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15787)
*Lukas Helff,Ahmad Omar,Felix Friedrich,Wolfgang Stammer,Antonia Wüst,Tim Woydt,Rupert Mitchell,Patrick Schramowski,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SLR is an automated framework for evaluating and training LLMs via scalable logical reasoning, creating tasks with controlled difficulty and no human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess and improve LLMs' logical reasoning abilities without relying on human-labeled data.

Method: SLR synthesizes tasks with ground-truth rules, validation programs, and prompts, forming SLR-Bench with 19k+ prompts across 20 difficulty levels.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with logical inference despite valid syntax; logic-tuning via SLR improves accuracy (e.g., doubling Llama-3-8B's performance).

Conclusion: SLR provides a scalable, automated way to enhance LLMs' reasoning, achieving competitive results with lower computational costs.

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

*Myke C. Cohen,Zhe Su,Hsien-Te Kao,Daniel Nguyen,Spencer Lynch,Maarten Sap,Svitlana Volkova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate AI agents in mission-critical negotiations, focusing on personality traits and AI characteristics. Experiments show how these factors impact negotiation outcomes and trustworthiness, providing actionable insights for reliable AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for adaptable AI agents in high-stakes negotiation contexts involving diverse human operators and stakeholders.

Method: Uses Sotopia as a simulation testbed for two experiments: (1) causal discovery to measure personality impacts on bargaining, and (2) human-AI job negotiations with manipulated traits and AI characteristics.

Result: Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect negotiation outcomes. AI trustworthiness impacts mission effectiveness. Sociocognitive measures reveal empathic communication and moral foundations.

Conclusion: The study provides a repeatable evaluation methodology for AI reliability in diverse human-agent dynamics, advancing beyond standard metrics to include social dynamics for mission success.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex
operations.

TL;DR: BEWA is a Bayesian-based architecture for structured scientific belief updates, integrating replication scores, citation weighting, and temporal decay to enhance machine reasoning in dynamic scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of processing vast scientific literature by formalizing belief updates and ensuring rational, auditable reasoning.

Method: Uses Bayesian inference, replication scores, citation weighting, temporal decay, and graph-based claim propagation to model belief dynamically.

Result: Enables probabilistically coherent belief updates, author credibility modeling, and audit-resilient integrity in scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: BEWA provides a robust framework for machine reasoning, promoting truth utility and rational belief convergence in science.

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient
integrity across dynamic scientific domains.

*William Sharpless,Dylan Hirsch,Sander Tonkens,Nikhil Shinde,Sylvia Herbert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel value functions for dual-objective RL problems, leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi equations to address Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems, and proposes DO-HJ-PPO for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard constraints in RL degrade policy performance, and Lagrangian methods require complex tuning. The work aims to simplify and improve constrained decision-making.

Method: Extends Hamilton-Jacobi equations to derive explicit Bellman forms for dual-objective problems, decomposing them into reach, avoid, and reach-avoid subproblems. Proposes DO-HJ-PPO for implementation.

Result: DO-HJ-PPO outperforms baselines in tasks like safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, showing distinct behaviors.

Conclusion: The approach provides a new perspective on constrained RL, solving dual-objective problems effectively with tractable methods.

Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the
reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.
Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often
require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we
extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to
propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we
address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and
penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds
of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which
typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable
Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and
reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From
a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are
complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems
and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained
decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal
Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of
tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that
DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches
and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.

*Reyna Abhyankar,Qi Qi,Yiying Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI for desktop tasks has high latency due to excessive model calls, and agents take unnecessary steps compared to human efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impractical latency of current AI systems in desktop tasks and guide future agent development.

Method: Study temporal performance on OSWorld benchmark, analyze latency causes, and create OSWorld-Human for comparison.

Result: Model calls dominate latency, and agents take 1.4-2.7x more steps than humans.

Conclusion: Future AI agents must optimize planning and reduce steps to match human efficiency.

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks
involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on
improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are
practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of
minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.
To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of
computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of
computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We
find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the
majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a
task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a
task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the
original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each
task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found
that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than
necessary.

*Tom Jeleniewski,Hamied Nabizada,Jonathan Reif,Felix Gehlhoff,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces verification mechanisms for an ontology-based process model to ensure correct data retrieval and interpretation in manufacturing, demonstrated via a Resin Transfer Molding use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like context-relevant data selection, unit compatibility, and input data completeness in modeling parameter interdependencies for manufacturing processes.

Method: Uses SPARQL-based filtering, unit consistency checks, and data completeness checks within an ontology-based process model.

Result: Demonstrates applicability in Resin Transfer Molding, supporting verifiable engineering models.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms enhance the reliability and reusability of process knowledge in manufacturing.

Abstract: The formalization of process knowledge using ontologies enables consistent
modeling of parameter interdependencies in manufacturing. These
interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that
define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as
calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application
and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and
applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data
retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required
to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the
completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.
This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed
ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,
data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach
includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic
classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the
evaluability of interdependencies. The applicability of the approach is
demonstrated with a use case from Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), supporting the
development of machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

### [17] [Geometric Learning in Black-Box Optimization: A GNN Framework for Algorithm Performance Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16144)
*Ana Kostovska,Carola Doerr,Sašo Džeroski,Panče Panov,Tome Eftimov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using graph neural networks and heterogeneous graph structures to predict optimization algorithm performance, outperforming traditional tabular methods by up to 36.6% in MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional performance prediction methods overlook algorithm configurations, which are crucial for understanding optimization outcomes.

Method: Uses heterogeneous graph data structures and graph neural networks to model relationships between problems, algorithm configurations, and performance. Evaluates 324 modCMA-ES and 576 modDE variants on BBOB problems.

Result: Achieves up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over tabular-based methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of geometric learning for performance prediction in black-box optimization.

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization
often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape
analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine
learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such
approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing
performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem
characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best
represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data
structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization
algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm
configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,
modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free
optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576
modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem
dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional
tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning
in black-box optimization.

### [18] [Large Language Models are Near-Optimal Decision-Makers with a Non-Human Learning Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16163)
*Hao Li,Gengrui Zhang,Petter Holme,Shuyue Hu,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans in decision-making tasks involving uncertainty, risk, and adaptability, but their decision processes differ from humans, raising concerns about their use as substitutes for human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs learn and perform decision-making compared to humans, especially in real-world dimensions like uncertainty, risk, and adaptability.

Method: Benchmarked five leading LLMs against 360 human participants using three experimental psychology tasks probing uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting.

Result: LLMs often outperformed humans, achieving near-optimal performance, but their decision-making processes fundamentally differed from humans.

Conclusion: While LLMs excel in decision-making, their divergence from human processes underscores risks in relying on them as substitutes, necessitating further research.

Abstract: Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and
civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be
delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;
however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,
remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making
behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world
decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three
well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these
dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.
Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal
performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged
fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates
the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to
changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on
them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

### [19] [Approximation Fixpoint Theory with Refined Approximation Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16294)
*Linde Vanbesien,Bart Bogaerts,Marc Denecker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) by introducing more refined approximation spaces to overcome its limitations in certain non-monotonic reasoning formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFT has limitations in handling certain simple examples despite its broad applicability in non-monotonic reasoning. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors generalize AFT by introducing a more refined notion of approximation spaces, moving beyond intervals to improve expressiveness.

Result: The extended AFT framework showcases improved expressiveness and explores relations between different approximation spaces.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends AFT to handle more refined approximations, enhancing its applicability in non-monotonic reasoning.

Abstract: Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is a powerful theory covering various
semantics of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms in knowledge representation
such as Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming. Many semantics of such
non-monotonic formalisms can be characterized as suitable fixpoints of a
non-monotonic operator on a suitable lattice. Instead of working on the
original lattice, AFT operates on intervals in such lattice to approximate or
construct the fixpoints of interest. While AFT has been applied successfully
across a broad range of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, it is confronted by
its limitations in other, relatively simple, examples. In this paper, we
overcome those limitations by extending consistent AFT to deal with
approximations that are more refined than intervals. Therefore, we introduce a
more general notion of approximation spaces, showcase the improved
expressiveness and investigate relations between different approximation
spaces.

### [20] [Explainable Rule Application via Structured Prompting: A Neural-Symbolic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16335)
*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A structured prompting framework improves LLMs' rule-based reasoning by decomposing tasks into verifiable steps, combining neural and symbolic methods for better consistency and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with consistent rule application and explainability in domains like legal analysis, which require precise logical inference alongside natural language understanding.

Method: The framework breaks reasoning into three steps: entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application, integrating neural and symbolic approaches with formal verification.

Result: On the LegalBench hearsay task, the method outperformed baselines, with OpenAI models achieving F1 scores of 0.929 (o1) and 0.867 (o3-mini), up from 0.714 and 0.74.

Conclusion: The hybrid neural-symbolic system enhances transparent and consistent rule-based reasoning, showing promise for explainable AI in legal tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle
with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability,
particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language
understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured
prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps:
entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By
integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs'
interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal
verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain
experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture.
Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach
significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing
substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini
reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates,
compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This
hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and
consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI
applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

### [21] [IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402)
*Xiaoya Lu,Zeren Chen,Xuhao Hu,Yijin Zhou,Weichen Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Lu Sheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IS-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating interactive safety in embodied agents, revealing current VLMs' lack of safety awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods fail to assess dynamic risks in interactive environments, necessitating a new approach.

Method: IS-Bench features 161 scenarios with 388 safety risks, enabling process-oriented evaluation of risk mitigation.

Result: Experiments show current VLMs lack interactive safety awareness, and safety-aware Chain-of-Thought often hinders task completion.

Conclusion: IS-Bench lays the groundwork for safer embodied AI systems by addressing critical safety limitations.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

*Sami Abboud,Eleanor Hanna,Olivier Jeunen,Vineesha Raheja,Schaun Wheeler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated approach for optimizing consumer communication, replacing manual marketer work with a sequential decision-making framework to enhance personalization and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual orchestration of consumer communication is labor-intensive and limits personalization, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: The approach uses a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual Treatment Effect estimation and Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Deployed across 150 million users, the method significantly increased engagement for various goal events in a multi-service application.

Conclusion: The automated framework effectively replaces manual efforts, improving engagement and scalability in consumer communication.

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate
various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features
or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised
recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The
conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on
labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation
of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a
sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular
decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel
event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual
Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application,
where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of
goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across
150 million users.

*Zexi Liu,Yuzhu Cai,Xinyu Zhu,Yujie Zheng,Runkun Chen,Ying Wen,Yanfeng Wang,Weinan E,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ML-Master, a novel AI4AI agent, integrates exploration and reasoning with a memory mechanism, outperforming existing methods by 29.3% in efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven development is becoming more efficient than human-centric approaches, but current AI4AI methods struggle to leverage accumulated experience, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: ML-Master uses a selectively scoped memory mechanism to combine insights from parallel solution trajectories with analytical reasoning.

Result: ML-Master achieves a 29.3% average medal rate on MLE-Bench, outperforming baselines, especially in medium-complexity tasks, within half the time.

Conclusion: ML-Master demonstrates significant potential for advancing AI4AI by efficiently integrating exploration and reasoning.

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level
performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes
more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this
transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate
and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.
While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are
often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the
exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies
and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a
novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by
employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master
to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories
with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the
agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it
achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,
particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior
performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used
by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a
powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

*Mustafa Akben,Aaron Satko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Elo rating-based method to improve LLM performance in analyzing harmful content, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' built-in moderation systems hinder analysis of harmful content like microaggressions and hate speech, affecting research validity.

Method: An Elo rating-based method is introduced to enhance LLM performance for harmful content analysis.

Result: The method outperforms traditional LLM prompting and conventional models in accuracy, precision, and F1 scores on microaggression and hate speech datasets.

Conclusion: The approach improves reliability, reduces false positives, and supports organizational applications like workplace harassment detection and fostering inclusive environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge resource in AI, highlighting gaps in current systems and proposing a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack verifiable, general-purpose knowledge resources, leading to issues like knowledge gaps in large language models, robotic planning limitations, and reliance on human expertise for fact-checking.

Method: The paper synthesizes findings from a AAAI workshop with over 50 researchers, proposing a community-driven approach and an open engineering framework for knowledge modules.

Result: The proposed framework aims to integrate modern knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, along with conventions and social structures for contributors.

Conclusion: A collaborative, open framework is essential for developing a robust knowledge infrastructure to address AI's current limitations.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge
resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite
the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and
other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available
sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large
language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks
necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information
relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most
needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and
evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore
these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a
community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to
leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one
promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge
modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a
framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are
adopted by contributors.

### [26] [The Role of Explanation Styles and Perceived Accuracy on Decision Making in Predictive Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16617)
*Soobin Chae,Suhwan Lee,Hanna Hauptmann,Hajo A. Reijers,Xixi Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how explanation styles and perceived AI accuracy impact decision-making in Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), highlighting gaps in current XAI evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in PPM lack interpretability, reducing user trust. XAI aims to address this, but current evaluations overlook user-centered impacts.

Method: A decision-making experiment tested effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low/high) on task performance, agreement, and confidence.

Result: Perceived accuracy and explanation style significantly affect decision-making metrics like task performance and confidence.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of user-centered XAI evaluations in PPM, showing that explanation styles and perceived accuracy influence decision-making.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) often uses deep learning models to
predict the future behavior of ongoing processes, such as predicting process
outcomes. While these models achieve high accuracy, their lack of
interpretability undermines user trust and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to address this challenge by providing the reasoning behind the predictions.
However, current evaluations of XAI in PPM focus primarily on functional
metrics (such as fidelity), overlooking user-centered aspects such as their
effect on task performance and decision-making. This study investigates the
effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, and
counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low or high) on decision-making in
PPM. We conducted a decision-making experiment, where users were presented with
the AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and explanations of different
styles. Users' decisions were measured both before and after receiving
explanations, allowing the assessment of objective metrics (Task Performance
and Agreement) and subjective metrics (Decision Confidence). Our findings show
that perceived accuracy and explanation style have a significant effect.

*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-dimensional, rule-based model using spatiotemporal data to analyze football tactics, focusing on interpretable state variables for pass success prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models are either computationally expensive (spatial/kinematic equations), lack interpretability (reinforcement learning), or don't fully account for player states (rule-based models). The study aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: Defines interpretable state variables for ball-holder and pass receivers, uses expert input to identify key variables, and trains an XGBoost model on StatsBomb and SkillCorner data to predict pass success.

Result: Distance between player and ball, along with space score, were key factors in pass success. The model is interpretable and practical for tactical analysis.

Conclusion: The low-dimensional, rule-based approach effectively captures football tactics, offering interpretability and practical decision-making support.

Abstract: Understanding football tactics is crucial for managers and analysts. Previous
research has proposed models based on spatial and kinematic equations, but
these are computationally expensive. Also, Reinforcement learning approaches
use player positions and velocities but lack interpretability and require large
datasets. Rule-based models align with expert knowledge but have not fully
considered all players' states. This study explores whether low-dimensional,
rule-based models using spatiotemporal data can effectively capture football
tactics. Our approach defines interpretable state variables for both the
ball-holder and potential pass receivers, based on criteria that explore
options like passing. Through discussions with a manager, we identified key
variables representing the game state. We then used StatsBomb event data and
SkillCorner tracking data from the 2023$/$24 LaLiga season to train an XGBoost
model to predict pass success. The analysis revealed that the distance between
the player and the ball, as well as the player's space score, were key factors
in determining successful passes. Our interpretable low-dimensional modeling
facilitates tactical analysis through the use of intuitive variables and
provides practical value as a tool to support decision-making in football.

### [28] [Incentivizing High-quality Participation From Federated Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16731)
*Jinlong Pang,Jiaheng Wei,Yifan Hua,Chen Qian,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an incentive-aware framework for federated learning (FL) to address participation and data heterogeneity issues, using Wasserstein distance and a Stackelberg game model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL research assumes voluntary participation and ignores data heterogeneity, leading to potential inefficiencies and low-quality contributions.

Method: The framework introduces Wasserstein distance to measure heterogeneous effort, uses peer prediction for truthful reporting, and employs a two-stage Stackelberg game to formalize participation.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show the framework's effectiveness in improving convergence and participation.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism successfully addresses participation and data heterogeneity challenges in FL, enhancing collaboration and model quality.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating
collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model
without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers
from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish
participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the
system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From
the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be
unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for
data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by
contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware
framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to
accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion
of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and
reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful
reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of
any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score
functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that
formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed mechanism.

*Yanchen Zhu,Honghui Zou,Chufan Liu,Yuyu Luo,Yuankai Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid charging infrastructure model combining fixed and mobile chargers, optimized using deep reinforcement learning and MPC-based demand prediction, to improve charging availability and reduce user inconvenience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fixed charging stations struggle with dynamic demand, leading to underutilization or congestion. Mobile chargers offer flexibility, but integrating them optimally with fixed stations is a challenge.

Method: Introduces the HCSPO problem, combining fixed and mobile charger planning. Uses MPC for demand prediction and deep reinforcement learning with heuristic scheduling for optimization.

Result: Case studies show the method enhances charging availability and reduces user inconvenience compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach with optimized planning and operation effectively addresses dynamic charging demand in urban networks.

Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and
environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and
adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations
often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature
of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution,
capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper
addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging
infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road
networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation
(HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration
of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic
operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model
grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve
the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented
with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of
fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case
studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces
user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.

TL;DR: The paper explores geographic biases in image generation models like FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, revealing a preference for metropolis-like areas and issues with European-sounding names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the geographic knowledge and biases embedded in state-of-the-art image generation models when applied to urban analysis and design.

Method: Generated 150 synthetic images per U.S. state and capital using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, analyzed similarity with DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and Fréchet Inception Distances.

Result: Models show implicit geographic learning but exhibit bias toward metropolis-like areas and struggle with European-sounding names.

Conclusion: Image generation models have geographic biases, favoring urban areas and facing disambiguation challenges, highlighting the need for more balanced training data.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a
limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases
they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

*Tomoya Kashimata,Yohei Hamakawa,Masaya Yamasaki,Kosuke Tatsumura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments is proposed by extending a BBO approach using an Ising machine, demonstrating adaptability in wireless communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time systems require optimization in dynamic environments, but conventional MAB algorithms fail due to combinatorial complexity.

Method: Extends BBO using an Ising machine to explore actions, considering variable interactions and environmental changes.

Result: The method shows dynamic adaptability in a wireless communication system with moving users.

Conclusion: The proposed heuristic MAB method effectively optimizes dynamic, discrete environments where traditional methods fall short.

Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables.
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms
perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the
corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO
method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is
represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant
reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where
real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average
reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions
resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional
MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments.
Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by
extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the
actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic
environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in
a wireless communication system with moving users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework for solving Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) in robotic task planning, combining graph and image-based representations for real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate and efficient task planning for mobile robots in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental monitoring, where GTSP is a key problem.

Method: Introduces a coordinate-based image builder, adaptive resolution scaling, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate geometric and spatial features.

Result: MMFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in GTSP instances and maintains computational efficiency for real-time use, validated by physical robot tests.

Conclusion: The MMFL framework effectively solves GTSP in robotic task planning, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots,
especially in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental
monitoring. These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of
several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
(GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To
address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that
leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary
aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality
task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a
coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling
strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a
multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective
integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that
our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required
for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel LfD algorithm improves Mahjong bots' proficiency and preserves unique play styles, addressing limitations of existing offline learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline learning and LfD algorithms perform suboptimally in Mahjong due to randomness and out-of-distribution states, highlighting the need for better methods.

Method: Leverages gameplay histories of Mahjong agents and introduces a modified Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for LfD.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances agent proficiency while preserving distinct play styles.

Conclusion: The novel LfD algorithm effectively addresses challenges in Mahjong AI, improving both performance and stylistic diversity.

Abstract: A wide variety of bots in games enriches the gameplay experience and enhances
replayability. Recent advancements in game artificial intelligence have
predominantly focused on improving the proficiency of bots. Nevertheless,
developing highly competent bots with a wide range of distinct play styles
remains a relatively under-explored area. We select the Mahjong game
environment as a case study. The high degree of randomness inherent in the
Mahjong game and the prevalence of out-of-distribution states lead to
suboptimal performance of existing offline learning and
Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithms. In this paper, we leverage the
gameplay histories of existing Mahjong agents and put forward a novel LfD
algorithm that necessitates only minimal modifications to the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm. The comprehensive empirical results illustrate that our
proposed method not only significantly enhances the proficiency of the agents
but also effectively preserves their unique play styles.

TL;DR: DREAM enhances LLMs' multi-step FOL reasoning by diversifying proof strategies and correcting errors, improving performance by 0.6% to 6.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step FOL reasoning due to limited proof strategy diversity and early errors, hindering complex mathematical tasks.

Method: DREAM introduces Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification and Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to improve proof diversity and correctness.

Result: DREAM improves LLMs' theorem proving accuracy by 0.6% to 6.4% on a dataset of 447 theorems in Lean 4.

Conclusion: DREAM advances LLMs' mathematical reasoning by addressing proof strategy limitations and error correction, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL)
reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their
effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL
deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on
established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step
FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on
our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited
exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning
mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM,
a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs'
generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy
Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a
Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their
proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical
reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage
solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated
dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

Motivation: To assess the robustness of benchmarks evaluating the safety of Large Language Models, particularly for bias.

Method: Compare rankings of representative models using various widely used bias evaluation methods.

Result: Disparate model rankings emerge from different evaluation methods.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for the community to improve the usage and standardization of benchmarks.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RFMDataset to evaluate large reasoning models' performance on mathematical proofs, revealing significant shortcomings like low correctness rates, diverse reasoning failures, and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overestimation of large reasoning models' capabilities due to reliance on numerical evaluations and benchmark leakage, the paper uses mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool.

Method: The authors create the RFMDataset with 200 proof problems and analyze models' performance, identifying 10 fine-grained error types.

Result: Models struggle with proofs (correctness <20%), exhibit diverse reasoning failures, and show hallucination and incompleteness.

Conclusion: Current models lack sufficient self-reflection and require formalized, fine-grained logical training to improve reasoning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable
mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of
these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical
evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning
shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and
methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose
these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal
Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and
thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis
of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental
limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models
grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely
correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2)
models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently
demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of
single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness
during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection
is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating
formalized and fine-grained logical training.

*Josiah P. Hanna,Nicholas E. Corrado*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how model-free RL can lead to 'thinking' behaviors in large language models, introducing a theoretical 'thought MDP' model to analyze conditions for such emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when model-free RL induces 'thinking' as a strategy for reward maximization, despite thinking actions not directly influencing rewards or world states.

Method: Introduces a theoretical 'thought MDP' model, analyzes policy initialization's role, and validates conditions with open-source LLMs. Also hypothesizes sufficient conditions for thinking outside language tasks.

Result: Proves policy initialization's impact on thinking emergence and shows open-source LLMs meet theoretical conditions for thinking-like behavior. Introduces a toy domain demonstrating data-efficient RL with thinking.

Conclusion: Model-free RL can produce thinking-like behaviors under specific conditions, with potential applications beyond language generation.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence
of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither
produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is
more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent
understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for
reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a
theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process}
(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an
abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP
model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether
or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent
to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing
to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our
theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like
behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable
thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy
domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought
actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

### [40] [Chain-of-Trust: A Progressive Trust Evaluation Framework Enabled by Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17130)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Lei Zhang,Xuemin,Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A progressive trust evaluation framework (chain-of-trust) is proposed for collaborative systems, using task decomposition and generative AI to reduce complexity and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of comprehensive trust assessment due to network dynamics and data latency in collaborative systems.

Method: Divides trust evaluation into chained stages, gathering relevant device attributes per stage, and uses generative AI for analysis.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in trust evaluation by progressively filtering trustworthy devices.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces evaluation overhead while maintaining accuracy in dynamic collaborative environments.

Abstract: In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources,
trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective
mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying
information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and
collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a
comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust
evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of
misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task
completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages
based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion
process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant
to that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By
leveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning
capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the
collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices
deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.
The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
high accuracy in trust evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedPerturb, a dataset to evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations, revealing differences in sensitivity to gender, style, and format changes between LLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs and humans differ in handling real-world clinical variability, ensuring clinical robustness for safe deployment.

Method: MedPerturb dataset with 800 clinical contexts, perturbed along gender, style, and format axes, comparing outputs from four LLMs and human experts.

Result: LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style changes, while humans are more affected by format perturbations like summaries.

Conclusion: Evaluation frameworks must account for clinical variability to ensure LLM decisions align with human clinician standards.

Abstract: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large
Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may
differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.
To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically
evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.
MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each
transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping
or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial
tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or
summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts
grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three
human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies
to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect
diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are
more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are
more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical
summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go
beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and
LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

TL;DR: AET improves adversarial robustness by adding an ERM phase before AT, enhancing feature learning and reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many adversarial training variants focus on stronger attacks but neglect foundational feature representations. AET aims to address this gap.

Method: AET prepends an ERM phase to conventional AT to cultivate a better feature manifold for robustness.

Result: AET achieves comparable or superior robustness faster, improves clean accuracy, and reduces training costs by 8-25%.

Conclusion: Feature pre-conditioning via standard training is key for efficient, principled robust defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDPU, a generalized learning framework for Label Proportion Learning (LLP), addressing challenges in obtaining precise proportion labels. It introduces an unbiased risk estimator and a correction method to mitigate overfitting, validated by theoretical bounds and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications struggle with obtaining precise instance proportion labels in LLP. The paper aims to align with real-world scenarios and leverage proportional constraints effectively.

Method: The MDPU framework models instance distribution under constraints, derives an unbiased risk estimator via ERM, and introduces a risk correction method to prevent overfitting.

Result: Theoretical generalization error bounds prove consistency, and experiments on multiple datasets validate MDPU's effectiveness against baselines.

Conclusion: MDPU provides a robust solution for LLP by addressing practical challenges, ensuring theoretical consistency, and demonstrating empirical success.

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional PINNs by creating a domain-specific, sparse, and small model for parametric PDEs.

Method: Uses a greedy algorithm for high-quality data selection, knowledge distillation from pre-trained PINNs, and down-sampling for physics-informed loss calculation.

Result: Achieves high efficiency with significantly fewer parameters than traditional PINNs.

Conclusion: S$^2$GPT-PINN offers a scalable and efficient solution for parametric PDEs with minimal computational resources.

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric
partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to Small Language Models (SLMs),
S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and
characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power.
Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically
rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models,
S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to
achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first
is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are
transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling
when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the
number of data sites by orders of magnitude to the size of the small model.

Motivation: Improve prediction accuracy for dynamic cellular traffic influenced by exogenous factors.

Method: End-to-end framework with CNNs (attention for spatial dynamics) and Kalman filters (temporal modeling), leveraging auxiliary data like social activities.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning techniques on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns and improves prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASE-Q, a method combining bias correction and asymmetric scaling to improve quantization in LLMs by reducing rounding and clipping errors, while enabling blockwise optimization to save memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rotational quantization methods for LLMs have limitations: they fail to align channel means (increasing rounding errors) and make activation distributions more Gaussian-like (increasing clipping errors). These issues limit performance and require memory-intensive full-model backpropagation.

Method: BASE-Q addresses these issues by combining bias correction and asymmetric scaling. It also supports blockwise optimization, avoiding the need for full-model backpropagation.

Result: Experiments show BASE-Q reduces the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5%, 42.9%, and 29.2% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively.

Conclusion: BASE-Q is an effective solution for improving quantization in LLMs, offering significant accuracy gains and practical memory savings.

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient exploration of model collapse in LLM training, especially beyond single-model settings or statistical surrogates.

Method: Proposes LWD framework, simulating the Internet with a RAG database to analyze model output convergence, supported by theoretical guarantees from Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: Demonstrates convergence patterns in model outputs and provides theoretical backing for these findings.

Conclusion: LWD offers an efficient way to investigate model collapse at the network level, enhancing understanding of LLM training dynamics.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether LAMs learn action-relevant changes or noise from unlabeled videos, given the ambiguity in frame differences.

Method: Introduces a tractable linear model to analytically study LAM learning, connecting it to PCA and evaluating strategies like data augmentation and auxiliary action-prediction.

Result: Provides insights into LAM learning dynamics, including the influence of observation, action, and noise structures, supported by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The study clarifies LAM learning, highlighting effective strategies to ensure latents capture controllable changes rather than noise.

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Sercan Ö. Arık,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-STAR is a novel approach for building LLM-based MLE agents that combines external knowledge retrieval with iterative refinement and targeted exploration of ML components, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based MLE agents rely too heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and coarse exploration strategies, limiting their effectiveness in model selection and deep component exploration.

Method: MLE-STAR retrieves effective models from the web, forms an initial solution, and iteratively refines it by exploring specific ML components, guided by ablation studies. It also introduces a novel ensembling method.

Result: MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of Kaggle competitions on MLE-bench, significantly outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: MLE-STAR addresses limitations of existing approaches by integrating external knowledge and targeted exploration, demonstrating superior performance in MLE tasks.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering
(MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However,
existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM
knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code
structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific
models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as
experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these,
we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first
leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective
models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it
by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This
exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual
code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an
effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that
MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench,
significantly outperforming the best alternative.

*Jiaxing Li,Hanjiang Hu,Yujie Yang,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A verifiable model-free safety filter using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability is introduced, addressing the lack of formal guarantees in learning-based safety filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based safety filters outperform conventional methods but lack formal safety guarantees.

Method: Extends verifiable self-consistency for Q value functions, proposes a multiplicative Q-network, and develops a verification pipeline.

Result: Successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety certificates in four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach provides formally verified safety guarantees for learning-based safety filters.

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods,
such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting
to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal
safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety
filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary
contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for
Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to
mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification
pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our
proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety
certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

*Iliyas Ibrahim Iliyas,Souley Boukari,Abdulsalam Yau Gital*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework combining kernel PCA, MLP, and MIGA for disease classification achieves high accuracy (up to 100%) and reduces tuning time by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disease classification accuracy and efficiency by integrating nonlinear feature extraction, MLP, and parallel optimization.

Method: Uses kernel PCA for dimensionality reduction, MLP for classification, and MIGA for parallel hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Achieved 99.12% (breast cancer), 94.87% (Parkinson's), and 100% (CKD) accuracy, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for disease classification, with MIGA significantly reducing computational time.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature
extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal
component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality
while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic
algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten
generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin
Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and
the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best
accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100%
for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods,
such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a
standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that
improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced
the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high
computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing
interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and
steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for
breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

### [52] [SimuGen: Multi-modal Agentic Framework for Constructing Block Diagram-Based Simulation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15695)
*Xinxing Ren,Qianbo Zang,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimuGen is a multimodal agent-based framework designed to generate accurate Simulink simulation code by combining visual diagrams and domain knowledge, addressing LLMs' limitations in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with generating reliable Simulink models due to lack of domain-specific pretraining data.

Method: SimuGen uses a collaborative, modular approach with specialized agents (investigator, reviewer, generator, etc.) and a knowledge base.

Result: The framework enables interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation.

Conclusion: SimuGen effectively bridges the gap in LLMs' capabilities for Simulink model generation, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still
struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models,
which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our
preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable
and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the
lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge,
we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically
generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual
Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized
agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator,
executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific
knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable,
robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is

*Haipeng Zhou,Sicheng Yang,Sihan Yang,Jing Qin,Lei Chen,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, Chain-of-Cancer (CoC), for cancer survival prediction using four modalities, including clinical data and language, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on pathology and genomics data, but epigenetic changes (e.g., methylation) and textual descriptions are overlooked. The paper aims to integrate these for better prediction.

Method: Proposes CoC framework with intra-learning (domain-specific clinical data) and inter-learning (language prompting and Autoregressive Mutual Traction for synergy).

Result: Evaluated on five public cancer datasets, the method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The CoC framework effectively combines multiple modalities for survival prediction, with validated performance and plans to release code.

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients.
Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either
individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis,
epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this
task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to
guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four
modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting
survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and
inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain
domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we
use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual
Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework
facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated
across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota
results. Codes will be released.

*Yunhak Oh,Junseok Lee,Yeongmin Kim,Sangwoo Seo,Namkyeong Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spotscape is a novel framework for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) that improves spot representations by capturing global relationships and regulating distances between spots, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods for SRT fail to provide meaningful spot representations, especially near boundaries, due to overemphasis on adjacent spots with minimal feature differences.

Method: Spotscape introduces a Similarity Telescope module for global relationships and a similarity scaling strategy for multi-slice integration.

Result: Spotscape outperforms existing methods in single-slice and multi-slice scenarios.

Conclusion: Spotscape offers a superior solution for SRT analysis by addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

### [55] [BLUR: A Benchmark for LLM Unlearning Robust to Forget-Retain Overlap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15699)
*Shengyuan Hu,Neil Kale,Pratiksha Thaker,Yiwei Fu,Steven Wu,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	exttt{BLUR}$, a benchmark for evaluating machine unlearning in LLMs, addressing limitations of current benchmarks by providing realistic forget-retain overlap scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning benchmarks are flawed due to disparate forget and retain sets, leading to misleading evaluations of unlearning effectiveness and vulnerability to relearning attacks.

Method: The authors propose $	exttt{BLUR}$, a benchmark with extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying difficulty.

Result: Existing unlearning methods perform poorly on $	exttt{BLUR}$, with simpler approaches outperforming recent methods, highlighting the need for robust evaluation.

Conclusion: $	exttt{BLUR}$ underscores the importance of realistic benchmarks for LLM unlearning and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/forgelab/BLUR

### [56] [Contraction Actor-Critic: Contraction Metric-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Robust Path Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15700)
*Minjae Cho,Hiroyasu Tsukamoto,Huy Trong Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance optimality and scalability in control policies under unknown dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCMs alone lack trajectory optimality and require known dynamics, limiting scalability. Combining CCMs with RL addresses these issues.

Method: Proposes the Contraction Actor-Critic (CAC) algorithm, which learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) and an optimal tracking policy using actor-critic RL.

Result: CAC improves CCMs by providing contracting policies with long-term optimality, validated in simulated and real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating CCMs with RL enhances control policy performance and scalability, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compiler-R1 is an RL-driven framework enhancing LLMs for compiler auto-tuning, addressing dataset and interaction challenges, achieving 8.46% IR instruction reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of high-quality reasoning datasets and limited effective interactions in LLM-driven compiler tuning.

Method: Introduces Compiler-R1 with a curated dataset and a two-stage RL training pipeline for efficient exploration and learning.

Result: Achieves an average 8.46% reduction in IR instruction count compared to opt -Oz across seven datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates RL-trained LLMs' strong potential for compiler optimization; code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics
such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent
advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/Compiler-R1.

*Peter Belcak,Greg Heinrich,Jan Kautz,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Minifinetuning (MFT) reduces overfitting-induced degeneralization in low-data settings without pre-training data, outperforming standard finetuning and parameter-efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the deterioration of general performance in language models when finetuned for new domains, especially with limited data.

Method: MFT uses corrective self-distillation individualized at the sample level to mitigate overfitting and degeneralization.

Result: MFT shows 2-10x better specialization-to-degeneralization ratios and robustness with as little as 500 samples.

Conclusion: MFT is effective for domain adaptation, composable with other methods, and mitigates degeneralization without pre-training data.

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

*Guoqing Chao,Zhenghao Zhang,Lei Meng,Jie Wen,Dianhui Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIMCFG improves federated multi-view clustering by globally fusing graph guidance and addressing missing data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack global feature exploitation and overlook missing data in federated multi-view clustering.

Method: Uses dual-head graph convolutional encoders for global and view-specific features, fused under a global graph, with pseudo-label supervision.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and superiority in experiments.

Conclusion: FIMCFG successfully integrates global information and handles missing data, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

### [60] [Learn from the Past: Fast Sparse Indexing for Large Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15704)
*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS is a method to accelerate sparse indexing in LLMs by leveraging historical attention patterns, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demand for KV caches in LLMs grows with longer contexts, creating bottlenecks. Existing sparse attention methods inefficiently retrieve indices without using historical data.

Method: LFPS dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates using historical attention patterns (vertical and slash) and a positional expansion strategy to predict Top-k indices.

Result: LFPS achieves up to 22.8x speedup over full attention and 9.6x speedup over exact Top-k retrieval on benchmarks, preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: LFPS provides an efficient and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon,Teo Susnjak,Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs show promise for zero-shot forecasting of macroeconomic indicators, matching classical models in stable conditions but struggling during rapid shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the zero-shot forecasting capabilities of TSFMs for macroeconomic indicators without extensive training or customization.

Method: Applied three TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT, Moirai) to univariate forecasting of economic indicators, tested under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks.

Result: TSFMs internalized economic dynamics, handled regime shifts, and provided uncertainty estimates, matching multivariate models in stable conditions but degrading during rapid shocks.

Conclusion: TSFMs are viable for zero-shot macroeconomic forecasting in stable conditions but require caution during periods of rapid shocks.

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

### [62] [MDPO: Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15706)
*Yunze Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning by addressing DPO's limitations in long-chain tasks. MDPO optimizes at three granularities and aligns training with generation metrics, showing improved performance on GSM8K and MATH datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods struggle with long-chain mathematical reasoning due to ineffective preference capture and misalignment with generation metrics, leading to incorrect outputs.

Method: Proposes MDPO, optimizing LLMs at Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and Step2Step granularities, with unified training objectives aligned to generation metrics.

Result: Achieves improvements of 1.7% and 0.9% on GSM8K, and 2.3% and 1.2% on MATH datasets, outperforming DPO and variants.

Conclusion: MDPO effectively enhances LLMs' mathematical reasoning by addressing DPO's limitations and provides a cost-effective data construction pipeline.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLMs by optimizing resource allocation during search. DORA, a new method, outperforms baselines by focusing on direction-level allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search methods inefficiently allocate compute resources, favoring reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and propose DORA, which decouples direction quality from candidate count for optimal allocation.

Result: DORA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025 benchmarks with comparable compute cost.

Conclusion: DORA provides a provably optimal solution for TTS, improving efficiency and performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs for brain disease detection often ignore causal relationships between brain regions, which are crucial for understanding cause-effect interactions.

Method: CGB uses causal discovery (transfer entropy) and geometric curvature to model and refine causal brain networks, enhancing GNN performance.

Result: CGB achieves higher F1 scores in brain disease classification compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CGB's focus on causality and graph refinement improves brain disease detection, demonstrating its superiority over traditional correlation-based approaches.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

### [65] [Studying and Improving Graph Neural Network-based Motif Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15709)
*Pedro C. Vieira,Miguel E. P. Silva,Pedro Manuel Pinto Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for directly estimating network motif significance-profiles (SPs) using GNNs, bypassing traditional subgraph frequency estimation, and validates it on synthetic and real-world graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore GNNs for SP prediction, an under-explored area with no benchmarks, and to overcome limitations of subgraph frequency estimation.

Method: The method reframes SP estimation as multitarget regression, focusing on interpretability, stability, and scalability, and tests it using synthetic and real-world graphs.

Result: Results show 1-WL limited models struggle with precise SP estimation but can generalize to approximate graph generation processes.

Conclusion: The study suggests direct SP estimation with GNNs can bypass theoretical limitations of subgraph counting for motif estimation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

*Siru Ouyang,Xinyu Zhu,Zilin Xiao,Minhao Jiang,Yu Meng,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAST transfers RL-induced probability adjustments from small to large models, enhancing reasoning efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is resource-intensive and doesn't add new knowledge but reshapes output distributions. This work explores transferring RL effects across model sizes.

Method: RAST injects RL-induced probability adjustments from a small RL-trained model into larger models.

Result: RAST improves reasoning in base models with lower GPU memory usage, sometimes outperforming direct RL training.

Conclusion: RAST offers a scalable, efficient way to leverage RL benefits without high computational costs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

*Le Jiang,Liyan Ma,Guang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for targeted noise injection in federated learning to protect sensitive areas from gradient inversion attacks, improving privacy without significantly degrading model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy leakage in federated learning, especially in healthcare, due to gradient inversion attacks, necessitating a nuanced defense mechanism.

Method: Uses a shadow model with interpretability to identify sensitive areas for targeted noise injection, tested on medical datasets.

Result: Achieves better privacy metrics (PSNR, SSIM) with minimal impact on model performance (<1% F1 reduction).

Conclusion: The framework effectively defends against gradient inversion attacks while maintaining model accuracy, validated across diverse medical images.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a BERT-style pretraining framework for battery fault detection, improving accuracy and representation quality by adapting LLMs to time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with temporal dependencies and unlabeled data in battery fault detection, while LLMs are not directly suited for numerical time-series data.

Method: Extends BERT with a time-series-to-token module and point-MSM pretraining task for self-supervised learning on battery data, combined with metadata for classification.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.945, outperforming existing methods in representation and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Validates BERT-style pretraining as effective for time-series fault detection in batteries.

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model predicts floating offshore asset behavior with high accuracy, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail in extreme sea states and nonlinear responses, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Supervised machine learning with multivariate regression, combining gradient-boosted ensemble and a custom solver, trained on 1M samples.

Result: Mean errors <5% for mooring parameters and <2.5° for vessel heading, outperforming frequency-domain methods.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time monitoring and decision-making in offshore operations.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic
metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering.
While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign
conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses.
This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate
regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel
in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a
gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver,
trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model
achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters
and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean
conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods.
The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility,
demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational
decision-making in offshore environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform (STLT) replaces self-attention in transformers, offering dynamic adaptability and scalability for ultra-long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational bottleneck of self-attention in transformers while maintaining or improving performance on tasks like language modeling and translation.

Method: Introduces trainable parameters for Laplace nodes, enabling dynamic adaptation of decay rates, frequencies, and window bandwidth. Uses fast recursive convolution, FFT-based relevance matrix computation, and adaptive node allocation.

Result: Achieves comparable or better perplexities and scores on tasks like WikiText-103, WMT'14 En-De, and NarrativeQA, extending to 100k+ token contexts.

Conclusion: The STLT combines interpretability, scalability, and robustness, providing a viable alternative to self-attention for ultra-long sequences.

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuronSeek-TD replaces symbolic regression with tensor decomposition for stable, fast-converging task-driven neurons, backed by theoretical guarantees and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the human brain's task-specific neurons, the paper aims to improve deep learning by optimizing neuron formulations for stability and convergence.

Method: Uses tensor decomposition (TD) instead of symbolic regression to discover optimal neuron formulations, with theoretical guarantees for function approximation.

Result: NeuronSeek-TD achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and competitive performance against state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The NeuronSeek-TD framework provides a robust, theoretically grounded approach for designing task-driven neurons, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for
different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization framework for selecting alternates in citizens' assemblies to improve representation by minimizing expected misrepresentation, addressing dropout issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The legitimacy of deliberative democracy panels relies on representing the broader population, but dropout of panelists leads to unbalanced compositions. Existing methods ignore alternate selection, creating a gap.

Method: The authors propose an algorithmic approach using learning-theoretic machinery to estimate dropout probabilities from historical data and optimize alternate selection.

Result: Theoretical guarantees include worst-case bounds on sample complexity and loss. Empirical evaluation shows improved representation with fewer alternates compared to current practices.

Conclusion: The optimization framework effectively addresses dropout issues in citizens' assemblies, enhancing representation and efficiency.

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

*Zhengze Zhang,Shiqi Wang,Yiqun Shen,Simin Guo,Dahua Lin,Xiaoliang Wang,Nguyen Cam-Tu,Fei Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces daDPO, a method combining preference optimization and distribution-based distillation to enhance smaller LLMs, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs struggle with conversational abilities, and current knowledge distillation methods overlook the teacher model's output distribution.

Method: Proposes daDPO (Distribution-Aware DPO), a unified approach for preference optimization and distribution-based distillation.

Result: daDPO significantly improves performance, enabling pruned models to achieve near-teacher performance and smaller models to occasionally outperform larger ones.

Conclusion: daDPO effectively bridges the gap in enhancing smaller LLMs, offering a robust solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

TL;DR: BuildingBRep-11K is a dataset of 11,978 multi-storey buildings with detailed annotations, designed for training AI models in 3D object generation. It includes geometric and metadata files, ensuring architectural compliance. Two PointNet models demonstrate its learnability for regression and defect detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large, clean, and richly annotated datasets for training AI models in building-scale 3D object generation.

Method: A shape-grammar-driven pipeline generates the dataset, incorporating design principles and multi-stage filters. Two lightweight PointNet models are trained for multi-attribute regression and defect detection.

Result: The regression model achieves 0.37-storey MAE, 5.7-room MAE, and 3.2 m² MAE on mean area. The defect detection model reaches 54% accuracy, recalling 82% of true defects.

Conclusion: BuildingBRep-11K is learnable but challenging for geometric regression and topological quality assessment, making it a valuable resource for AI research in architecture.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of
building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training
such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We
introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors)
buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that
encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a
geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based
openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed
per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale,
daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass
multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme
aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the
dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i)
Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total
rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100
unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room
MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same
backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the
network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \%
precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K
is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological
quality assessment

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional threshold-based control methods limit heat pump efficiency for hot water production, and ML optimization for household demand forecasting is understudied.

Method: A composite approach using ML (LightGBM, LSTM, Bi-LSTM with self-attention) and isolation forest (iForest) for demand forecasting and anomaly detection, with multi-step feature selection and time-series analysis.

Result: LightGBM outperformed LSTM variants with RMSE improvements up to 9.37% and R² values of 0.748-0.983. iForest achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a 5.2% false alarm rate.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes heat pump operations for household hot water demand, demonstrating strong generalization and suitability for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for
sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains
restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine
learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications,
optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines
predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production
strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key
contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation
forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer
responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced
time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and
tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention
mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4)
experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments
show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance,
with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$
values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation
achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\%,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household
types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed feature extractors in FSCIL limit adaptability to new classes, leading to forgetting and overfitting.

Method: Proposes Tri-WE for weight-space ensemble and amplified data knowledge distillation for regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100.

Conclusion: Tri-WE effectively balances adaptability and knowledge retention in FSCIL.

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bohdi is a synthetic-data-only framework for heterogeneous LLM fusion, addressing limitations of existing methods by enabling dynamic domain exploration and adaptive data sampling via a hierarchical tree structure and multi-armed bandit problem formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM fusion methods rely on limited real data and fixed domain allocations, leading to incomplete knowledge acquisition and capability imbalance. Bohdi aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Bohdi organizes knowledge domains hierarchically, uses multi-model collaboration for data generation, and adapts sampling proportions dynamically via DynaBranches and Introspection-Rebirth mechanisms.

Result: Bohdi outperforms baselines, achieves higher data efficiency, and balances capabilities across domains, as shown in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bohdi effectively addresses the limitations of current LLM fusion methods, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for heterogeneous LLM integration.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: UNIMATE is a unified model for mechanical metamaterial design, addressing all three key modalities (3D topology, density condition, mechanical property) and outperforming baselines in tasks like topology generation, property prediction, and condition confirmation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning models for mechanical metamaterials often overlook one of the three key modalities, creating a gap in comprehensive design capabilities.

Method: UNIMATE combines a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion generation module to handle all three modalities.

Result: UNIMATE outperforms baselines by up to 80.2% in topology generation, 5.1% in property prediction, and 50.2% in condition confirmation.

Conclusion: UNIMATE bridges the gap in metamaterial design by unifying all three modalities and achieves superior performance, with its model and results made publicly available.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,

### [79] [MadaKV: Adaptive Modality-Perception KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15724)
*Kunxi Li,Zhonghua Jiang,Zhouzhou Shen,Zhaode Wang,Chengfei Lv,Shengyu Zhang,Fan Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MadaKV is a modality-adaptive KV cache eviction strategy for MLLMs, improving efficiency in long-context inference by addressing modality disparities and reducing memory/latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KV cache eviction methods are unimodal and fail to handle modality-specific information in MLLMs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: MadaKV uses modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation to dynamically retain critical tokens based on modality importance.

Result: MadaKV reduces KV cache memory and decoding latency (1.3-1.5x improvement) while maintaining accuracy in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: MadaKV outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing MLLM efficiency for long-context tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

*Matteo Ninniri,Marco Podda,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrIDDD, a graph diffusion model, adapts molecular size during generation, outperforming existing models in property-driven tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models can't adjust graph size, limiting their use in property-driven molecular design.

Method: Reformulated noising/denoising processes to allow dynamic node insertion/deletion, creating GrIDDD.

Result: GrIDDD matches/exceeds existing models in property targeting and competes in molecular optimization.

Conclusion: GrIDDD enables size-adaptive molecular generation, advancing graph diffusion applications.

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

*Jackson Burns,Akshat Zalte,William Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CheMeleon, a molecular foundation model, uses deterministic molecular descriptors for pre-training, outperforming baselines in property prediction but struggles with activity cliffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecular property prediction accuracy using machine learning, especially with small datasets, by leveraging noise-free molecular descriptors.

Method: CheMeleon pre-trains on Mordred package descriptors using a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network, avoiding noisy experimental or biased simulation data.

Result: Achieves 79% win rate on Polaris tasks and 97% on MoleculeACE assays, outperforming Random Forest and other models, but fails at activity cliff distinction.

Conclusion: Descriptor-based pre-training is promising for scalable molecular property prediction, warranting further exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled data.

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is
pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in
particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on
small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular
foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the
Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to
predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional
approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical
simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich
molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and
MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,
outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop
(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)
and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity
cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's
learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,
highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results
underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and
effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further
exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ) is a graph convolutional transformer model for EHR data, capturing cross-encounter medical event interactions better than static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based EHR models are static, failing to capture temporal dependencies and cross-encounter interactions.

Method: DeepJ combines graph convolutional networks with transformers and differentiable graph pooling to model intra- and inter-encounter event interactions.

Result: DeepJ outperforms five baselines, identifying key event clusters for patient outcome prediction with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: DeepJ enhances patient risk stratification by effectively modeling temporal and functional medical event relationships.

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling
complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a
static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or
collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when
it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning
longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling
interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To
address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel
graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to
effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event
interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related
medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to
patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five
state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability,
demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

*Luiz Pereira,M. Hadi Amini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm, FedWB, uses Wasserstein barycenters for model fusion in distributed DNN training, and extends to HFRL for heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address model fusion in distributed DNN training and tackle heterogeneous environments in federated reinforcement learning.

Method: Divide data among agents with identical DNNs, train locally, and aggregate weights using Wasserstein barycenters (FedWB). Extend to HFRL with DQNs in varied environments.

Result: FedWB successfully trains a global DNN, and the HFRL approach yields a global DQN functional across heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: FedWB and HFRL methods are effective for distributed and heterogeneous learning, validated on the CartPole problem.

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that
leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network
(DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into
equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks
and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After
some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the
weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These
steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage
the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to
tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test
experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles
to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each
environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a
global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a
global DQN that functions across all environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model using XGBoost for in-field calibration of low-cost air quality sensors improves accuracy by leveraging neighboring sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-cost sensors limit spatial coverage, while low-cost sensors suffer from drift due to environmental and manufacturing issues.

Method: Uses XGBoost ensemble learning to calibrate sensors by consolidating data from neighboring sensors.

Result: Reduces reliance on individual sensor accuracy and enhances generalization across locations.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a scalable solution for accurate air quality monitoring with low-cost sensors.

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing
due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM),
particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly
accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their
coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are
prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing
variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using
XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This
approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and
improves generalization across different locations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks often mispredict confidence, but incorporating human uncertainty data can improve calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the miscalibration of neural networks by comparing their uncertainty estimates with human perceptual uncertainty.

Method: Using vision benchmarks with human disagreement and confidence annotations, assessing correlation between model and human uncertainty.

Result: Current methods weakly align with human intuition; human-derived soft labels improve calibration without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: Human insights can bridge the gap between model and human uncertainty, aiding in developing more trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary RF Model) improves generative modeling by enforcing boundary conditions, outperforming vanilla RF with better FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla RF model's unconstrained velocity field fails to meet boundary conditions, causing inaccuracies in ODE and amplified errors during stochastic sampling.

Method: Proposes Boundary RF Model, enforcing boundary conditions with minimal code changes.

Result: Achieves 8.01% FID improvement with ODE sampling and 8.98% with SDE sampling on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Boundary RF Model effectively addresses boundary condition issues, enhancing generative modeling performance.

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality
generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a
limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural
network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary
conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from
the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling
at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary.
To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary
RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code
modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model,
demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and
8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

TL;DR: POLCA identifies hidden conceptual breakthroughs in model training by decomposing loss changes into interpretable clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible discontinuities in loss curves are rare, but similar breakthroughs may be hidden due to scalar loss metrics. Understanding these can reveal deeper learning dynamics.

Method: Introduces POLCA, a method to decompose loss changes along low-rank training subspaces, identifying clusters of samples with similar loss dynamics.

Result: Validated on synthetic and natural language tasks, POLCA successfully recovers interpretable clusters representing model breakthroughs.

Conclusion: POLCA offers a tool for unsupervised interpretability by uncovering hidden phase transitions in training.

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible
discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these
breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only
when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs
occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric
that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden
transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along
arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to
identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during
training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of
conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and
natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent
interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the
promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised
interpretability.

Result: Identified key salary and role influencers and distinct job clusters, though based on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a transferable framework for job market analysis, despite synthetic data limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning methodology prototype using a large

text-based feature extraction and representation, this study aims to uncover
the key features influencing job market dynamics and provide valuable insights
for job seekers, employers, and researchers. Exploratory data analysis was
conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, regression
models were developed to predict salaries, classification models to predict job
titles, and clustering techniques were applied to group similar jobs. The
analyses revealed significant factors influencing salary and job roles, and
identified distinct job clusters based on the provided data. While the results
are based on synthetic data and not intended for real-world deployment, the
methodology demonstrates a transferable framework for job market analysis.

TL;DR: SHRED models use RNNs and MLPs for efficient system identification and forecasting. T-SHRED improves SHRED by using transformers and a SINDy attention mechanism for better performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance and interpretability of shallow recurrent decoders (SHRED) for predicting chaotic dynamical systems from sparse sensor data.

Method: Introduce transformers (T-SHRED) for temporal encoding and a SINDy attention mechanism for symbolic regression in the latent space.

Result: T-SHRED with SINDy attention accurately predicts future states and provides interpretable symbolic models across low- and high-data regimes.

Conclusion: T-SHRED with SINDy attention improves prediction accuracy and model interpretability, making it effective for diverse dynamical systems.

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification
and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight
and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops.
SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding
respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able
to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and
temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this
work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal
encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large
datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression
directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture.
Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and
regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the
performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from
low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED
accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model
across all tested datasets.

*Sheng Liu,Tianlang Chen,Pan Lu,Haotian Ye,Yizheng Chen,Lei Xing,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fractional Reasoning is a training-free, model-agnostic framework for dynamically adjusting reasoning intensity in LLMs at inference time, improving performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods apply uniform reasoning across inputs, ignoring varying problem complexities. Fractional Reasoning addresses this by allowing tailored reasoning depth.

Method: Extracts a latent steering vector for deeper reasoning and scales it dynamically based on input complexity, supporting breadth- and depth-based strategies.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA show consistent performance improvements across tasks and models.

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning offers a flexible, effective way to enhance LLM performance by adapting reasoning intensity to input needs.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how contrastive examples can enhance machine learning by explaining label differences and improving sample efficiency.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of contrastive examples on active learners, using geometric and Boolean function classes.

Result: Shows how contrastive examples influence sample complexity and uncovers a connection to self-directed learning.

Conclusion: Contrastive examples can significantly improve learning efficiency, with theoretical ties to existing learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with
pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that
differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the
difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various
types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus
is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is
influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results
with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly,
we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the
classical model of self-directed learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided graph neural network framework is proposed to predict soil GHG fluxes by integrating agricultural process-based models and graph neural networks, addressing data scarcity in agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision prediction of soil GHG fluxes is crucial for sustainable agriculture, but data scarcity hinders machine learning applications.

Method: The framework combines an agricultural process-based model to generate diverse datasets and a graph neural network with autoencoders to extract and integrate key features for accurate predictions.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and stability for predicting fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data scarcity and improves GHG flux prediction, aiding sustainable agriculture efforts.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajDiff is a novel framework for trajectory similarity computation addressing semantic gaps, noise, and global ranking challenges, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based methods for trajectory similarity computation struggle with semantic gaps, noise, and lack of global ranking awareness.

Method: TrajDiff uses semantic alignment, noise-robust pre-training, and ranking-aware regularization to address these issues.

Result: TrajDiff achieves a 33.38% average HR@1 gain across three datasets, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: TrajDiff effectively improves trajectory similarity computation by addressing key challenges and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of
trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in
trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role
in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based
methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS
and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful
trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well
as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion
patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on
point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking
information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity
to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a
novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.
Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an
attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating
semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified
representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training
introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model
training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall
ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global
perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show
that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In
particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three
evaluation metrics and datasets.

Method: A retrospective cohort of 1,535 ICU patients with DM and AF was analyzed. Data preprocessing included imputation, normalization, and feature engineering. Feature selection involved univariate and multivariate steps. Seven ML models were trained with cross-validation and SMOTE oversampling.

Result: Logistic regression performed best (AUROC: 0.825). Key predictors were RAS, age, bilirubin, and extubation. ALE plots revealed non-linear effects like age-related risk acceleration.

Conclusion: The model provides accurate mortality prediction and clinical insights for early ICU triage in high-risk DM and AF patients.

Abstract: Background: Patients with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation
(AF) face elevated mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet models
targeting this high-risk group remain limited.
  Objective: To develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model predicting
28-day mortality in ICU patients with concurrent DM and AF using early-phase
clinical data.
  Methods: A retrospective cohort of 1,535 adult ICU patients with DM and AF
was extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. Data preprocessing involved
median/mode imputation, z-score normalization, and early temporal feature
engineering. A two-step feature selection pipeline-univariate filtering (ANOVA
F-test) and Random Forest-based multivariate ranking-yielded 19 interpretable
features. Seven ML models were trained with stratified 5-fold cross-validation
and SMOTE oversampling. Interpretability was assessed via ablation and
Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) analysis.
  Results: Logistic regression achieved the best performance (AUROC: 0.825; 95%
CI: 0.779-0.867), surpassing more complex models. Key predictors included RAS,
age, bilirubin, and extubation. ALE plots showed intuitive, non-linear effects
such as age-related risk acceleration and bilirubin thresholds.
  Conclusion: This interpretable ML model offers accurate risk prediction and
clinical insights for early ICU triage in patients with DM and AF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate graph similarity is needed to reduce engineering effort and turnaround time in VLSI design by reusing prior solutions.

Result: Reduces MAE by 24.9%, correctly clusters all real-world design groups, and achieves up to 89% runtime reduction in a partitioning task.

Conclusion: Pieceformer is effective for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.

Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design,

TL;DR: The paper explores accelerating neural speech transcription by sparsifying time-domain signals early in transformer encoders, achieving up to 1.6x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech signals are highly compressible, and transformer-based models like Whisper can benefit from early sparsification to improve efficiency without fine-tuning.

Method: A systematic search over sparsification stages (encoder layers) and compression ratios (sparsity) was conducted using Whisper models.

Result: Optimal solutions sparsified hidden states to 40-60% sparsity early in encoding, achieving 1.6x runtime acceleration with <1% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Early sparsification in transformer encoders effectively accelerates speech transcription without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL approaches often overlook gradient correlations between clients, especially in data heterogeneity scenarios, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes PNCS to capture higher-order gradient moments and introduces a selection history queue for diverse client selection.

Result: Experiments with a VGG16 model show consistent improvements in convergence speed and accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The PNCS-based FL framework effectively addresses non-IID data challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging
diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by
avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account
for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation
that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity
(PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing
higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges,
enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple
algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue.
Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate

*Soumya Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends bandit learning to two-sided reward uncertainty in matching markets, showing the Extended Gale-Shapley algorithm outperforms the standard GS algorithm in achieving stable matchings under incomplete information. It achieves logarithmic pessimal stable regret and adapts to decentralized settings with minimal regret increase. A novel lower bound for binary stable regret is also established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on single-sided uncertainty in matching markets. This work aims to address the gap by studying two-sided reward uncertainty and its impact on stable matchings.

Method: The paper leverages the concept of 'super-stability' and employs the Extended Gale-Shapley algorithm. It develops centralized and decentralized algorithms to achieve stable matchings under incomplete information.

Result: The centralized algorithm achieves logarithmic pessimal stable regret, while the decentralized version incurs only a constant regret increase. A novel lower bound for binary stable regret is also derived.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of the Extended GS algorithm in handling two-sided uncertainty and provides insights into the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback, emphasizing the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching.

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward
uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided
uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we
demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the
standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete
information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm
attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent
admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized
setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel
centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret,
elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in
characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

*Esther Rodriguez,Monica Welfert,Samuel McDowell,Nathan Stromberg,Julian Antolin Camarena,Lalitha Sankar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why diffusion models perform poorly on tail classes in long-tailed datasets, attributing it to overlapping latent representations. It proposes CORAL, a contrastive regularization method, to improve tail-class sample quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with long-tailed data distributions, producing low-quality and less diverse samples for tail classes. The paper aims to understand and address this issue.

Method: The authors identify overlapping latent representations as the key problem and introduce CORAL, a framework using supervised contrastive losses to separate latent class representations.

Result: CORAL significantly enhances the diversity and visual quality of tail-class samples compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of class imbalance on diffusion models and demonstrates CORAL's effectiveness in mitigating these issues for tail classes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating
high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically
assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,
multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard
diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples
for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying
cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of
diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the
latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class
subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to
feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this
is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class
imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we
propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive
latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to
encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate
that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of
samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision
making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy
reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well
studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple
agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown
parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent
similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal
regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an
information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents,
the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret.
We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the
optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian
framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding
regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how
collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$,
$\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of
rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma}
\sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$
respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the
number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast,
agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

*Vinicius Yuiti Fukase,Heitor Gama,Barbara Bueno,Lucas Libanio,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify critical learning periods in deep neural network training, reducing computational costs and emissions without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works confirm critical learning periods but lack precise identification. This work aims to fill that gap for more efficient and sustainable deep learning.

Method: A systematic approach using generalization prediction to pinpoint critical phases, halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods.

Result: Reduces training time by up to 59.67%, CO$_2$ emissions by 59.47%, and costs by 60% without performance compromise.

Conclusion: Enhances training dynamics understanding and promotes sustainable, efficient deep learning, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep
learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many
training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the
existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the
literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In
this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for
identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,
focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and
effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data
pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint
critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive
ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,
we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in
training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on
standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.
Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time
of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in
CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising
performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the
way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation
models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository

*Jingyi Cui,Qi Zhang,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies conditions for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to recover monosemantic features from polysemantic ones and proposes a reweighting strategy to improve identifiability when conditions aren't fully met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify when SAEs can uniquely recover ground truth monosemantic features from polysemantic ones in large language models (LLMs).

Method: Theoretical analysis to propose necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs, followed by a reweighting strategy to narrow the loss gap between SAE and monosemantic feature reconstruction.

Result: The reweighted SAEs show improved monosemanticity and interpretability in experiments.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical and practical insights into improving SAEs for feature recovery in LLMs.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting
features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex
superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through
feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide
applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully
recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic
ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs
that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme
sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)
enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions
are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the
identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight
selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE
reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that
the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic
features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our
theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves
feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

*Haoyue Zhang,Hualei Zhang,Xiaosong Ma,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LazyEviction reduces KV cache memory by 50% while maintaining accuracy in long reasoning tasks by preserving recurring tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods struggle with long reasoning tasks, missing the Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon.

Method: Proposes LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework with Recurrence Interval Tracking and a Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy.

Result: Reduces KV cache size by 50% with comparable accuracy on math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Recurring tokens are critical for knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning, and LazyEviction effectively preserves them.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by
employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences
introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache
size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as
mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate
memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance
Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention
after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and
may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To
address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed
to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an
Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring
tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two
key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal
variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric
Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by
50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance
of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge
continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve strict temporal causality, sub-quadratic complexity, and multi-scale pattern recognition in time series forecasting.

Method: Uses hierarchical temporal modeling, dynamic windowed attention, and adaptive temporal encoding.

Result: 10.76X faster training, 6.06X memory reduction vs. PatchTST, with consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons.

Conclusion: AutoHFormer sets new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve
three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable
predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3)
multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We
introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,
while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of
cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise
time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in
hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have
redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating
exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and
computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain
signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRAIL is a bi-level RL framework combining deep learning and reward shaping to improve interpretability and learning stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and stability in reinforcement learning by attributing importance to state features and their interactions.

Method: VRAIL uses a two-stage approach: a DL stage for value function estimation and an RL stage with reward transformations. The estimator can be linear or quadratic for feature attribution.

Result: VRAIL improves training stability and convergence in Taxi-v3, identifies meaningful subgoals, and enhances interpretability without environment changes.

Conclusion: VRAIL is a model-agnostic framework that boosts both learning performance and interpretability in RL.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

*Zhen Qin,Michael B. Wakin,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for tensor decomposition using Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) on orthonormal factors, achieving linear convergence to ground-truth tensors with polynomial scaling in tensor order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor decompositions reduce parameters for high-order tensors but face nonconvex optimization challenges. The paper aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution.

Method: Leverages canonical tensor decompositions with orthonormal factors, applying RGD on the Stiefel manifold to optimize factors.

Result: Proves linear convergence to ground-truth tensors under mild conditions, with polynomial scaling in tensor order.

Conclusion: The framework improves upon existing methods for Tucker and tensor-train formats, offering scalable and efficient tensor decomposition.

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using
approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce
the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order
tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the
order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis
across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum
physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is
to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as
gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and
tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly
nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing
significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach
to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging
the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained
to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient
descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.
Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian
regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges
to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,
both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially
rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker
and tensor-train format tensors.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information

struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures,
and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel
multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models

batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of
tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural
content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with
manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and

compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmentation in ML workflows that hinders transparency, reproducibility, and adaptability in collaborative eScience projects.

Method: Introduces a data-centric framework with six artifacts (Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, Controlled Vocabulary) to version and trace ML experiments.

Result: The framework improves reproducibility, supports iterative exploration, and preserves decision provenance in ML workflows, as shown in a glaucoma detection case.

Conclusion: The structured artifact approach enhances reproducibility and traceability in collaborative ML projects, addressing current workflow challenges.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML),
especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data,
features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented,
relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools.
This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability
of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for
lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts:
Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These
artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions,
enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over
time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma
detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves
reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across
the ML lifecycle.

### [113] [CRIA: A Cross-View Interaction and Instance-Adapted Pre-training Framework for Generalizable EEG Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16056)
*Puchun Liu,C. L. Philip Chen,Yubin He,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRIA is a novel EEG representation learning framework that integrates temporal, spectral, and spatial views using cross-attention and masking strategies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG pre-training methods lack the ability to capture complex interactions among multiple views, limiting representation expressiveness and generalization.

Method: CRIA uses variable-length and variable-channel coding, cross-attention for feature fusion, and an attention matrix masking strategy with viewpoint masking.

Result: CRIA achieves 57.02% balanced accuracy for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: CRIA demonstrates strong generalization and effectiveness in EEG representation learning by integrating multi-view information.

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

### [114] [Floating-Point Neural Networks Are Provably Robust Universal Approximators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16065)
*Geonho Hwang,Wonyeol Lee,Yeachan Park,Sejun Park,Feras Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem for floating-point neural networks, proving their ability to perfectly approximate the direct image map of any rounded target function, with no expressiveness limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between theoretical neural network models (assuming infinite precision) and practical implementations (using finite-precision floating-point numbers), specifically whether the IUA theorem holds in the floating-point setting.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical proof of the IUA theorem for floating-point neural networks, highlighting differences from the real-valued setting.

Result: The result shows that floating-point neural networks can perfectly approximate the direct image map of any rounded target function, with no expressiveness limits. It also implies the existence of provably robust floating-point neural networks and computational completeness for certain floating-point programs.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the IUA theorem holds in the floating-point setting, demonstrating the expressive power of floating-point neural networks and revealing fundamental distinctions between real-valued and floating-point computational models.

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks
establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can
approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result
shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal
approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation
semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct
image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with
arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption
that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas
their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision
floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds
in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural
networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct
image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their
expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material
differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental
distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies
surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust
floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the
class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and
multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

### [115] [A Lightweight RL-Driven Deep Unfolding Network for Robust WMMSE Precoding in Massive MU-MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16072)
*Kexuan Wang,An Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight RL-driven deep unfolding network (RLDDU-Net) to improve the WMMSE precoding algorithm for massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems, addressing imperfect CSI and high complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMMSE precoding's practical deployment is limited by perfect CSI assumptions and high computational demands in massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems.

Method: Develops a stochastic WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm for imperfect CSI, then introduces RLDDU-Net, mapping SWMMSE iterations to network layers with RL for adaptive adjustments.

Result: RLDDU-Net outperforms baselines in ergodic weighted sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI, with better computational and convergence efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed RLDDU-Net effectively addresses WMMSE limitations, offering improved performance and efficiency for massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems.

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for
its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical
deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational
complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic
WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted
sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net),
where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU
module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity
as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating
convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module
adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to
mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI
demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance
while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

*Kexuan Wang,An Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CRL algorithm, CAAC, dynamically optimizes user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding in 6G networks, outperforming baselines in energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WMMSE precoding lacks adaptability to user-specific QoS and dynamic channels, necessitating a more flexible solution.

Method: CAAC integrates CSSCA for policy optimization and uses attention-enhanced Q-networks for efficient learning without prior environment knowledge.

Result: Simulations show CAAC achieves better energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction than existing methods.

Conclusion: CAAC provides a scalable and efficient solution for 6G networks, addressing dynamic QoS and energy efficiency challenges.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS)
demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely
recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to
adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To
address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)
algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy
network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding.
Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex
Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective
handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex
QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover,
CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy
updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not
only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency.
Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy
efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in current safety alignment methods for AI, proposing a probing method (ASA) and a training strategy (LAPT) to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods are shallow, focusing on surface-level behaviors, making models vulnerable to latent shifts triggering unsafe responses.

Method: Introduces a probing method (ASA) to measure latent space sensitivity and LAPT, a fine-tuning strategy injecting controlled perturbations into hidden representations.

Result: LAPT improves alignment robustness without degrading general capabilities, revealing flaws in current alignment paradigms.

Conclusion: The study advocates for representation-level training strategies over surface-level supervision to enhance AI safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework to improve brain disorder diagnosis by integrating brain region similarity and population graph modeling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods for brain disorder diagnosis rely on predefined atlases but ignore embedded information and confounding effects like site and phenotype variability.

Method: B2P-GL uses a two-stage approach: (1) brain representation learning with GPT-4 atlas knowledge and adaptive node reassignment, and (2) population disorder diagnosis incorporating phenotypic data for graph construction and feature fusion.

Result: B2P-GL achieves higher prediction accuracy on ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets and improves interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable, personalized approach for brain disorder diagnosis, enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

*Langzhang Liang,Fanchen Bu,Zixing Song,Zenglin Xu,Shirui Pan,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph rewiring method using spectrum-preserving sparsification to mitigate over-squashing in GNNs, balancing connectivity and property preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph rewiring techniques often neglect preserving critical properties like spectral properties and increase computational overhead.

Method: Proposes spectrum-preserving graph sparsification to enhance connectivity while maintaining sparsity and original graph spectrum.

Result: Outperforms baselines in classification accuracy and Laplacian spectrum retention.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces structural bottlenecks while preserving key graph properties.

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with
exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural
bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as
\textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring},
which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph
rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of
the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many
approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which
introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of
over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that
leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for
mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced
connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original
graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph
property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in
classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distilling a large teacher model into smaller student variants reduces memorization risks and computational costs compared to standard fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization in fine-tuned models, addressing privacy and security concerns.

Method: Studied the influence of different KD methods on memorization when distilling a large teacher model into smaller student variants.

Result: KD significantly reduces memorization risks while lowering computational costs and model size.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is an effective method to mitigate memorization risks in fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training
data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous
research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenge of translating Finnish rap lyrics using AI, comparing Faster Whisperer and YouTube's speech-to-text, with Mc Timo's lyrics as the reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finnish is complex, and rap adds pronunciation and meaning challenges, making it a fun yet tough test for AI speech-to-text.

Method: Compare Faster Whisperer and YouTube's speech-to-text by transcribing Finnish rap lyrics, measuring errors against Mc Timo's original lyrics.

Result: Hallucination and mishearing levels of AI will be quantified by error comparison.

Conclusion: The study aims to highlight AI's limitations and quirks in handling complex, artistic language like Finnish rap.

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to
understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language.
Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might
be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet
challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the
Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality.
The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little
brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging
because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The
hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be
measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The
error function is informal but still works for our case.

*Xun Wang,Jing Xu,Franziska Boenisch,Michael Backes,Christopher A. Choquette-Choo,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POST enables private and efficient transfer of soft prompts from small to large LLMs, reducing costs and preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft prompts are tied to specific LLMs, raising efficiency and privacy concerns due to high computational costs and data sharing requirements.

Method: POST uses knowledge distillation to derive a small model from a large LLM, tunes soft prompts locally (with optional differential privacy), and transfers them back using a public dataset.

Result: POST reduces computational costs, maintains privacy, and successfully transfers high-utility soft prompts.

Conclusion: POST addresses efficiency and privacy issues in soft prompt tuning, offering a practical solution for LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models
(LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their
interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in
APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples
while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context
window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to
the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This
constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning
prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs
continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,
soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.
For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these
issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that
enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently
transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to
derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt
transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential
privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small
public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,
preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

TL;DR: A novel ML technique using coupled JEPAs optimizes radio resource management for a remote control system, reducing transmit power by 50% without compromising control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize radio resource management in a remote control system without degrading control task performance.

Method: Uses two coupled JEPAs: one for control dynamics and another for wireless CSI, trained with deep RL for resource-efficient control policies.

Result: Simulations show a 50% reduction in transmit power while maintaining control performance comparable to non-optimized baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances resource efficiency and control performance in remote systems.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a
communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is
represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the
control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly
model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless
propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled
joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the
control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures
the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through
cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power
predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions
based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the
usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the
device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic
multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by
over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods
that do not account for wireless optimization.

TL;DR: BLANCE is a hybrid Bayesian framework integrating batch data and LM-derived knowledge for causal discovery, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in causal discovery due to batch data arrival and scarce expert knowledge, while mitigating LM issues like hallucinations and bias.

Method: Uses a Bayesian framework to combine sequential batch data with noisy LM-derived knowledge, shifting from DAG to PAG representation and employing adaptive edge queries.

Result: Outperforms prior work in structural accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM noise.

Conclusion: BLANCE effectively bridges gaps in causal discovery by integrating data and LM knowledge adaptively, offering improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to
data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in
batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a
surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and
bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid
Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential
batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both
data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates
ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global
LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a
sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative
edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural
accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM
noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED) method to optimize MRI acquisition by adaptively selecting the most informative measurements, balancing speed and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate MRI acquisition times without degrading image quality, requiring a balance between under-sampling and gathering sufficient data for high-fidelity reconstruction.

Method: Uses sequential BED with gradient-based optimization and diffusion-based generative models to select informative measurements, meeting acquisition constraints.

Result: Demonstrates versatility and performance in optimizing both image reconstruction and associated analysis tasks on various MRI acquisitions.

Conclusion: The proposed active BED method effectively balances acquisition speed and image quality, enhancing MRI utility in clinical settings.

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without
significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance
between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and
gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and
analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection
of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented
with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior
distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based
optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this
work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based
generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs
stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the
acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting
can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated
image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are
demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Conditional Wasserstein GAN (CWGAN) to generate synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients to address data scarcity and class imbalance, improving classifier training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and severe class imbalance in ALS EEG recordings hinder reliable machine learning classifier training.

Method: A CWGAN is trained on a private EEG dataset to generate synthetic ALS EEG signals, with detailed preprocessing, normalization, and hyperparameter selection.

Result: Qualitative evaluation shows synthetic signals mimic real ALS EEG patterns, and CWGAN training converged successfully.

Conclusion: Synthetic EEG signals can augment training data, mitigate class imbalance, and enhance ALS detection accuracy, facilitating data sharing and diagnostic models.

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Online Bookmaking problem, showing the bookmaker's optimal loss is the largest root of a polynomial. It provides an efficient algorithm for optimal strategy, linking regret to Hermite polynomials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize profit while mitigating loss in dynamic betting scenarios, ensuring fairness and financial safety for bookmakers.

Method: Develops an algorithm based on the Bellman-Pareto frontier, unifying dynamic programming and multi-criteria optimization.

Result: The bookmaker's optimal loss is characterized, and the algorithm achieves optimal loss against optimal gamblers, reducing loss otherwise.

Conclusion: Bookmakers can balance fairness and risk, with the solution revealing a connection between regret and Hermite polynomials.

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates
betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the
bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of
gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show
that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting
over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal
loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that
bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the
explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the
bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm
that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler,
the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is
suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a
notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the
Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for
Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the
Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

*Leo Gagnon,Eric Elmoznino,Sarthak Mittal,Tom Marty,Tejas Kasetty,Dhanya Sridhar,Guillaume Lajoie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of auto-regressive models in handling high-ambiguity predictions, proposing a method inspired by cognitive science to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational intractability of Bayes-optimal prediction in high-ambiguity scenarios, drawing insights from cognitive science.

Method: The authors introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic benchmark, and propose converting pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors to decouple task inference from token prediction.

Result: Transformers struggle with high-ambiguity predictions, but the proposed method shows substantial gains in ambiguous contexts.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of cognitive-inspired methods for improving model performance in ambiguous settings, though challenges remain.

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

*Pranav Pawar,Akshansh Dwivedi,Jenish Boricha,Himanshu Gohil,Aditya Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new TTS architecture improves multilingual accent accuracy and emotion modeling for Hindi and Indian English, outperforming existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems struggle with multilingual accents and culturally nuanced emotions, especially for Indic languages.

Method: Extends Parler-TTS with a hybrid encoder-decoder, culture-sensitive emotion layers, and dynamic accent code switching.

Result: 23.7% accent accuracy improvement, 85.3% emotion recognition, and 4.2/5 MOS for cultural correctness.

Conclusion: The system advances cross-lingual synthesis, with applications in EdTech and accessibility.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in
monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents
(especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses
difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This
paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with
preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly
tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS
model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid
encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers
trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent
code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests
demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction
from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native
listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system
is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste,
let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while
preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported
a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than
existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual
synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement,
with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

*Sajan Muhammad,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ENN-GFN-Enhanced, integrating epistemic neural networks (ENN) with GFlowNets for better uncertainty-driven exploration and trajectory identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently identifying optimal trajectories in GFlowNets by prioritizing exploration in under-learned reward regions.

Method: Combines ENN with GFlowNets for improved joint predictions and uncertainty quantification, tested in grid environments and sequence generation.

Result: ENN-GFN-Enhanced outperforms baseline GFlowNets, showing efficacy and efficiency in exploration and trajectory identification.

Conclusion: The integration of ENN enhances GFlowNets' exploration capabilities, leading to better performance in identifying optimal trajectories.

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'anomaly signatures' to improve interpretability in machine learning-based anomaly detection by highlighting contributing features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning's lack of interpretability in anomaly detection leaves users to independently analyze why events are flagged as anomalies.

Method: Proposes the concept of 'anomaly signatures' to highlight features influencing anomaly decisions.

Result: Enhances interpretability by clarifying which features contribute to anomaly detection outcomes.

Conclusion: Anomaly signatures offer a practical solution to improve transparency in machine learning-based anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning is often viewed as a black box when it comes to
understanding its output, be it a decision or a score. Automatic anomaly
detection is no exception to this rule, and quite often the astronomer is left
to independently analyze the data in order to understand why a given event is
tagged as an anomaly. We introduce here idea of anomaly signature, whose aim is
to help the interpretability of anomalies by highlighting which features
contributed to the decision.

### [132] [Bayesian Optimization over Bounded Domains with the Beta Product Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16316)
*Huy Hoang Nguyen,Han Zhou,Matthew B. Blaschko,Aleksei Tiulpin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Beta kernel for Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, addressing limitations of Matérn and RBF kernels in bounded domains. It shows superior performance in modeling functions with optima near hypercube boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing kernels like Matérn and RBF lack assumptions about function domains, limiting their effectiveness in bounded domains.

Method: The Beta kernel, a non-stationary kernel based on Beta distribution densities, is introduced to naturally model functions on bounded domains.

Result: Empirical analyses confirm the Beta kernel's exponential eigendecay rate, and experiments show it outperforms Matérn and RBF kernels in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The Beta kernel is robust and superior for bounded-domain optimization, demonstrating consistent advantages over traditional kernels.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to
optimize black-box functions. The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF)
covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions
about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in
bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a
non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density
functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on
bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that
the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses
of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima
located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show
that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the
well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic
function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

*Guan Zhe Hong,Bhavya Vasudeva,Vatsal Sharan,Cyrus Rashtchian,Prabhakar Raghavan,Rina Panigrahy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers in LLMs can identify and use latent concepts in ICL tasks, showing localized structures for concept disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if transformers represent latent structures or take shortcuts in ICL tasks, especially in multi-step reasoning.

Method: Examined transformers in 2-hop reasoning tasks (discrete latent concepts) and continuous latent concept tasks, analyzing representation subspaces.

Result: Models identify latent concepts and perform step-by-step composition in discrete tasks; continuous tasks show low-dimensional subspaces mimicking latent parameterization.

Conclusion: Transformers exhibit localized structures for disentangling latent concepts, refining understanding of ICL and their representations.

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

*Nikola Jovanović,Ismail Labiad,Tomáš Souček,Martin Vechev,Pierre Fernandez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First token-level watermarking for autoregressive image models, addressing reverse cycle-consistency and robustness challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track provenance of generative model outputs, especially autoregressive image models, which lack prior token-level watermarking.

Method: Adapt language model watermarking, improve reverse cycle-consistency via tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning, and add a watermark synchronization layer.

Result: Reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses key challenges and enables practical watermarking for autoregressive image models.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

*Jingtong Su,Julia Kempe,Karen Ullrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMD and SAMI, methods to interpret and control transformer models by mapping complex concepts to attention heads and adjusting their effects with a scalar parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in current attribution research, which overlooks attention mechanisms and lacks a unified approach for complex concepts.

Method: SAMD maps concepts to attention heads via cosine similarity, while SAMI adjusts their impact using a scalar.

Result: Demonstrates stable module locations, improves task performance (e.g., GSM8K +1.6%), and enables jailbreaking (+72.7%).

Conclusion: The approach is domain-agnostic and effective for interpreting and controlling transformers.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges in building energy management due to rising global energy demand and renewable integration complexity.

Method: 1. Cluster non-shiftable load profiles for policy generalization. 2. Use LSTM forecasting for dynamic responsiveness. 3. Apply domain-informed action masking for safe exploration.

Result: Reduces operating costs by up to 15%, maintains stable performance, and adapts to new buildings and tariff changes without retraining.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, robust, and cost-effective energy management for buildings.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have
placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a
three-step reinforcement learning(RL)-based Building Energy Management System
(BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning
to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster
non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling
policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building.
Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future
states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly,
domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation,
preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach
reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains
stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new
buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes
without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and
cost-effective building energy management.

Conclusion: The system is effective and scalable for livestock monitoring, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system for monitoring cattle behavior and

designed and deployed a low-cost Bluetooth-based neck collar equipped with
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to capture real-time behavioral data from
real cows, which was synced to the cloud. A labeled dataset was created using
synchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination,
lying, and others. We evaluated multiple machine learning models -- Support
Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) -- for behavior classification. Additionally, we implemented a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for estrus detection using behavioral patterns
and anomaly detection. Our system achieved over 93% behavior classification
accuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy on a limited test set. The approach
offers a scalable and accessible solution for precision livestock monitoring,
especially in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: SS-KAN integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks into a state-space framework for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box models lack interpretability of system dynamics, prompting the need for a more transparent approach.

Method: Proposes SS-KAN, combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with state-space modeling, validated on Silverbox and Wiener-Hammerstein benchmarks.

Result: SS-KAN offers enhanced interpretability through sparsity-promoting regularization and visualization of learned functions, though with slightly reduced accuracy compared to black-box models.

Conclusion: SS-KAN is a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability
of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model
is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein
benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to
sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned
univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of
accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting
SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system
identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system
dynamics.

TL;DR: GoalLadder uses vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL agents from a single language instruction in visual environments, outperforming competitors with a 95% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language can specify RL tasks concisely, but extracting rewards from language in visual environments is challenging due to noisy feedback or large data requirements.

Method: GoalLadder incrementally discovers task-progress states by querying a VLM to rank states using pairwise comparisons and an ELO-based rating system, minimizing distance to top-ranked goals in a learned embedding space.

Result: GoalLadder achieves a 95% success rate, significantly outperforming competitors (~45%).

Conclusion: GoalLadder effectively trains RL agents from language instructions in visual environments, reducing reliance on abundant or accurate feedback.

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of
specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards
from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that
can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,
especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,
pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment
representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate
noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL
agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder
works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to
completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to
identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to
rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not
trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal
states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects
of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with
minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,
which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to
bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train
a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms
existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation
environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only
$\sim$45% of the best competitor.

TL;DR: Directo is a novel generative model for directed graphs, addressing challenges in modeling edge directionality and lack of benchmarks, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed graphs are crucial in various applications, but their generation is underexplored due to complex dependencies and lack of standardized benchmarks.

Method: Directo uses discrete flow matching, positional encodings for asymmetric relations, a dual-attention mechanism, and a robust generative framework.

Result: Directo performs strongly across diverse settings and competes with specialized models, demonstrating effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: Directo establishes a foundation for future research in directed graph generation, addressing key limitations in the field.

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered
relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social
networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such
as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however,
directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors
limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality
introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying
distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive
models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the
first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow
matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings
tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism
capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete
generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite
covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs
strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for
particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the
effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation
for future research in directed graph generation.

TL;DR: DnD introduces a prompt-conditioned parameter generator to create LoRA weight updates without per-task training, reducing overhead and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for separate optimization runs for each downstream dataset in PEFT methods like LoRA.

Method: Uses a lightweight text encoder and hyper-convolutional decoder to map task prompts to LoRA matrices.

Result: Achieves up to 12,000x lower overhead than full fine-tuning and 30% better performance on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores different router architectures for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, evaluating their performance in terms of efficiency, latency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of bad routing in MoE models, which can lead to load imbalance and reduced accuracy.

Method: Six router variants (Linear, Attention, MLP, Hybrid, Hash, and MLP-Hadamard) were designed and tested using BERT and Qwen1.5-MoE models.

Result: Distinct trade-offs were observed: Linear routers are fast, MLP and Attention routers are more expressive, and MLP-Hadamard enables structured, sparse routing.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing MoE router designs to enhance large-scale model deployment.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

*Dian Meng,Zhiguang Cao,Yaoxin Wu,Yaqing Hou,Hongwei Ge,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EFormer is an Edge-based Transformer model for VRPs, using edge inputs and parallel encoding to outperform baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural heuristics for VRPs rely on node coordinates, which may not reflect real-world edge-based cost metrics effectively.

Method: EFormer uses a precoder module with mixed-score attention to convert edge data into node embeddings, and parallel encoding (graph and node encoders) for comprehensive edge representation. Decoding involves parallel context embedding and multi-query integration.

Result: EFormer outperforms baselines on TSP and CVRP synthetic datasets and generalizes well on real-world instances (TSPLib, CVRPLib).

Conclusion: EFormer's edge-based design is effective for VRPs, demonstrating strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely
on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical
scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more
relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based
Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach
employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert
edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel
encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each
responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature
spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of
the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context
embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention
mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path
construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer
outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale
and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization
on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the

TL;DR: PINNs solve PDEs using neural networks, and influence function-based sampling improves their training by targeting impactful data points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and interpretability of PINNs by applying XAI methods like influence functions for targeted data sampling.

Method: Using influence functions to identify and resample impactful training points in PINNs.

Result: Targeted resampling improves prediction accuracy in PINNs.

Conclusion: Influence function-based sampling is a practical XAI application for optimizing PINN training.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning model using multi-scale CNNs for EEG-based emotion recognition outperforms the state-of-the-art TSception model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a deep learning model for EEG-based emotion recognition in real-life contexts, leveraging advancements in EEG technology and machine learning.

Method: Proposes multi-scale CNNs with feature extraction kernels of varying ratios and a new kernel type that learns from four brain areas.

Result: The model consistently outperforms TSception in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance scores across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates superior performance for EEG-based emotion recognition, highlighting its potential for real-life applications.

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record
electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent
technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and
rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for
automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model
that can perform EEG-based emotion recognition in a real-life context, we
propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks
to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many
ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information
from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance
scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensorGuide enhances LoRA by using a tensor-train-guided framework to create correlated low-rank matrices, improving expressivity and efficiency without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's independent optimization of low-rank matrices limits expressivity and generalization, while classical TT decomposition fails to improve efficiency or performance.

Method: TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices via a unified TT structure with controlled Gaussian noise, enhancing joint representation.

Result: TensorGuide outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA in accuracy and scalability on quantum dot classification and GPT-2 fine-tuning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TensorGuide provides superior optimization dynamics, generalization, and parameter efficiency, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

### [148] [Black-Box Privacy Attacks on Shared Representations in Multitask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16460)
*John Abascal,Nicolás Berrios,Alina Oprea,Jonathan Ullman,Adam Smith,Matthew Jagielski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy risks in multitask learning (MTL) by analyzing shared representations, proposing black-box task-inference attacks, and demonstrating their effectiveness across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL's shared representations, while efficient, may leak sensitive task information, raising privacy concerns.

Method: A black-box task-inference attack is developed, exploiting embedding dependencies without shadow models or labeled data.

Result: Experiments show adversaries can infer task inclusion in training using fresh samples, supported by theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: Shared representations in MTL pose privacy risks, highlighting the need for safeguards against inference attacks.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages
similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to
train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data
sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by
learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks
by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being
designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively
learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can
inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were
trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared
representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose
a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the
embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples
from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when
training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box
attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between
embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled
reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for
multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh
task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully
infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide
theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict
separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the
target task's distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PITA introduces a novel framework combining annealing and diffusion smoothing for efficient sampling from unnormalized densities, enabling equilibrium sampling of complex systems with fewer evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient sampling from unnormalized densities is crucial for scientific applications, but existing diffusion-based samplers fail at molecular scales.

Method: PITA combines annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and diffusion smoothing, training diffusion models sequentially from high to low temperatures and using inference-time annealing with a novel Feynman-Kac PDE and Sequential Monte Carlo.

Result: PITA achieves equilibrium sampling of N-body systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with significantly reduced energy evaluations.

Conclusion: PITA advances diffusion-based sampling by enabling scalable and efficient sampling of complex molecular systems.

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

*Amir Reza Vazifeh,Jason W. Fleischer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NLDR techniques like t-SNE and UMAP effectively classify ECG signals and arrhythmias without training, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ECG analysis is error-prone, and existing machine learning methods struggle with signal variability and labeling inconsistencies.

Method: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques (t-SNE and UMAP) are applied to ECG signals from the MIT-BIH dataset.

Result: NLDR achieved >=90% accuracy in discriminating recordings and 98.96% median accuracy for arrhythmia classification.

Conclusion: NLDR is promising for automated ECG analysis, even with single-lead or 12-lead standards, and has broader healthcare applications.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart
activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring
cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and
prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for
automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations
in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals
can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow
different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder
supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component
analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and
typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are
missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.
Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate
these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no
need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the
MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate
individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish
different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%
and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise
for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the
current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond
cardiology.

TL;DR: SparseLoRA accelerates LLM fine-tuning using contextual sparsity, reducing computational cost by up to 2.2x and achieving 1.6x speedup without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is resource-intensive; existing methods like QLoRA and DoRA reduce memory but not computation. SparseLoRA addresses this gap.

Method: Introduces a lightweight, training-free SVD sparsity estimator to dynamically select sparse weights for loss/gradient computation, optimizing sensitivity across layers, tokens, and steps.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2x computational cost reduction and 1.6x speedup while maintaining accuracy across tasks like reasoning, code generation, and instruction following.

Conclusion: SparseLoRA efficiently reduces computational overhead in LLM fine-tuning without sacrificing performance, offering a practical solution for resource constraints.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the
number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease
computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this
paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning
through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD
sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss
and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address
sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results
show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a
measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various
downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code
generation, and instruction following.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model merging combines expert models but faces diminishing returns due to rank collapse in task vector space. Subspace Boosting mitigates this, improving merging efficacy by over 10% for up to 20 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diminishing returns and performance loss in merging multiple expert models, caused by rank collapse in task vector space.

Method: Introduces Subspace Boosting, which maintains task vector ranks using singular value decomposition, and employs Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to quantify task similarity.

Result: Subspace Boosting improves merging efficacy by over 10% for up to 20 expert models on vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting effectively mitigates rank collapse, enhancing model merging performance and providing interpretable task similarity insights.

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling) is introduced to mitigate reward hacking in reward models (RMs) by using causal and neutral augmentations, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often suffer from reward hacking, latching onto superficial attributes due to standard training objectives failing to disentangle causal and spurious factors.

Method: Crome employs causal augmentations (to enforce sensitivity along causal attributes) and neutral augmentations (to enforce invariance along spurious attributes), generated via answer interventions on causal rubrics.

Result: Crome outperforms baselines, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories, with consistent robustness across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Crome effectively addresses reward hacking, enhancing the alignment and robustness of reward models in LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to
latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or
formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for
the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs
because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,
leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally
Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model
designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic
targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are
pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity
along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which
are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce
invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced
without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along
causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,
Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving
average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in
specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the
consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N,
across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat,
chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and
the reasoning-specific GSM8k.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric combining NLI scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity is proposed to better assess intelligibility in dysarthric speech, outperforming traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ASR metrics (WER, CER) fail to measure intelligibility for dysarthric/dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment is more critical than exact word matches.

Method: Proposed a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity.

Result: Achieved a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility Project data, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The new metric highlights the importance of prioritizing intelligibility over error-based measures in ASR evaluations.

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility,
especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment
matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech
types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise
consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two
key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility,
and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR
transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores,
semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric
achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility
Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to
prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) to remove sensitive data from LLMs, addressing privacy and security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' tendency to memorize training data poses privacy and security risks, necessitating effective unlearning techniques.

Method: The study applies RMU to unlearn sensitive information, analyzing effects across decoder layers.

Result: RMU ranked 4th on leaderboards for 1B and 7B parameter models.

Conclusion: RMU is a promising technique for mitigating privacy risks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to
memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance,
and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to
mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due
to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive
Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive
information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of
unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective
regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the
official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

Motivation: To provide a principled analysis of transformer-based models by leveraging operator theory and free probability.

Method: Represent token embeddings and attention as self-adjoint operators, modeling layer-wise propagation as free additive convolution.

Result: Derived a generalization bound based on free entropy and predictable spectral trace evolution with depth.

Conclusion: Bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, offering insights into transformers' behavior and complexity.

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based
language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing
token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial
probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution
and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed
by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical
system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their
inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a
generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral
trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach
bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling
principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCP1, a single-sample robust conformal prediction method that reduces computational costs while maintaining robustness, outperforming methods requiring many forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust conformal prediction (RCP) methods using randomized smoothing are computationally expensive due to multiple forward passes per input. The goal is to achieve robustness with fewer passes.

Method: The proposed RCP1 method uses a single forward pass on a randomly perturbed input and certifies the conformal prediction procedure itself, rather than individual scores. It leverages any binary certificate and extends to classification and regression.

Result: RCP1 achieves robust prediction sets with smaller average size compared to state-of-the-art methods that require around 100 passes per input.

Conclusion: RCP1 offers a computationally efficient and robust alternative to existing RCP methods, applicable across various setups, including conformal risk control.

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-based transfer learning method for reinforcement learning, using out-of-distribution detection to improve sample efficiency by selectively applying teacher guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning struggles with poor sample efficiency, especially in multi-task or continual learning. Transferring knowledge from a teacher policy can help but may bias exploration if tasks differ too much.

Method: Uses energy-based transfer learning with out-of-distribution detection to selectively apply teacher guidance, ensuring intervention only in familiar states.

Result: Theoretical proof links energy scores to teacher's state-visitation density; empirical results show improved sample efficiency and performance in single- and multi-task settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances teacher guidance and exploration, enhancing efficiency and performance in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

TL;DR: FLAME introduces a federated learning framework using Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) to avoid performance loss from LoRA compression, addressing challenges like output mismatch and expert imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA compression methods in federated learning lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss.

Method: FLAME uses SMoE architecture, retaining full LoRA matrices and varying activated experts per client, with rescaling and activation-aware aggregation.

Result: FLAME outperforms existing methods across diverse computational settings.

Conclusion: FLAME provides a robust, effective solution for resource-adaptive federated learning.

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

TL;DR: SlepNet, a novel GCN using Slepian bases, outperforms traditional GNNs in representing and decoding spatiotemporal signal patterns on graphs, especially in neuroscience and traffic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs and graph signal processing methods struggle to efficiently represent localized signal patterning on graphs, which is crucial in domains like neuroscience.

Method: SlepNet employs Slepian bases to optimally concentrate signal energy on relevant subgraphs, automatically learned with a mask, providing canonical and high-resolution representations.

Result: SlepNet outperforms baselines in fMRI and traffic datasets, offering better resolution in distinguishing similar patterns and enabling downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SlepNet is effective for both prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data, advancing graph-based signal analysis.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on

graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing
patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in
subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.
Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult
to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph
Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or
spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown
promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly
confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that
uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian
harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant
subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce
canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing
energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated
SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and
two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional
GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines
in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns
from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,
and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here
we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for
other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both
for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

### [161] [Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic: Shifting the Agent-Environment Boundary for Diverse Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16608)
*Jiamin He,A. Rupam Mahmood,Martha White*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL framework redefines agent-environment boundaries by treating distribution parameters as actions, enabling continuous action spaces. The proposed DPPG method reduces gradient variance, and DPAC outperforms TD3 in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional RL frameworks by reparameterizing actions as distribution parameters, making the action space continuous and reducing gradient variance.

Method: Introduces DPPG, a generalized deterministic policy gradient estimator, and DPAC, an actor-critic algorithm based on TD3, enhanced with interpolated critic learning (ICL).

Result: DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo tasks and shows competitive performance in discretized action spaces.

Conclusion: The framework and DPAC algorithm effectively generalize action spaces and improve performance in RL tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

### [162] [Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629)
*Eric V. Strobl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBIAS optimizes outcome definitions to maximize causal identifiability in psychiatric longitudinal data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in causal inference due to symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding in psychiatry.

Method: DEBIAS learns non-negative, interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, leveraging time-limited treatment effects to minimize confounding.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for depression and schizophrenia.

Conclusion: DEBIAS provides a robust solution for causal inference in psychiatry with verifiable outcome unconfoundedness.

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.

*Eren Akbiyik,João Almeida,Rik Melis,Ritu Sriram,Viviana Petrescu,Vilhjálmur Vilhjálmsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal) is a cost-effective, transparent method for removing unwanted text segments using multilingual sentence embeddings and nearest-neighbor search, achieving near-LLM precision at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text processing methods struggle with multilingual and context-sensitive tasks, while LLMs are costly. SORE addresses these gaps.

Method: SORE uses metadata embedding to identify core content and flags segments matching outlier groups or deviating from the core.

Result: SORE outperforms structural methods and achieves high precision in diverse scenarios, processing millions of documents daily.

Conclusion: SORE offers an efficient, accurate alternative to traditional and LLM-based methods, with released implementation for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous
content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such
as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual
settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce
SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that
leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor
search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core
content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely
match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE
achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments
on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield
high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in
production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages
while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility
and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

### [164] [A Distributional-Lifting Theorem for PAC Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16651)
*Guy Blanc,Jane Lange,Carmen Strassle,Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributional-lifting theorem to extend efficient learning algorithms from limited distribution families to any distribution, with efficiency scaling by the complexity of expressing the target distribution as a mixture of the base family. It contrasts with prior work requiring strong access (conditional sample oracle) and presents a simpler, more general PAC-model-compatible lifter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of distribution-specific learning by enabling efficient learning for any distribution without strong access assumptions.

Method: Prove a distributional-lifting theorem and design a lifter that works in the standard PAC model, avoiding the need to learn the target distribution explicitly.

Result: The new lifter is efficient, works for all base distribution families, preserves noise tolerance, has better sample complexity, and is simpler than prior approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances distribution-free PAC learning by providing a practical and theoretically sound solution without relying on strong access assumptions.

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led
to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional
assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their
reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting
theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited
distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any
distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the
complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in
$\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of
lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a
conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded
by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from
semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information
to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with
access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that
sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the
standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base
distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better
sample complexity, and is simpler.

*Vijay Prakash Dwivedi,Charilaos Kanatsoulis,Shenyang Huang,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews Relational Deep Learning (RDL), which transforms relational databases into relational entity graphs for end-to-end learning, addressing challenges like multi-table integration and temporal dynamics, and explores unifying these into foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance graph machine learning by applying it to relational databases, enabling end-to-end learning without traditional feature engineering.

Method: Representing relational databases as relational entity graphs, reviewing benchmark datasets, and surveying neural network methods specialized for such graphs.

Result: Identifies key challenges (e.g., multi-table integration, temporal dynamics) and recent architectural advances for RDL.

Conclusion: RDL unifies graph machine learning sub-fields, paving the way for foundation models to transform relational data processing.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO) to overcome limitations of current functional generative models, expanding their applicability to diverse domains and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current functional generative models rely on Fourier Neural Operators, restricting them to regular grids and rectangular domains, limiting their broader scientific and engineering applications.

Method: MINO leverages graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms to create a domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.

Result: MINO significantly broadens the scope of functional generative models, enabling diverse applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks, and integrates neural operators with advanced deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: The paper presents MINO as a principled solution to current limitations, introduces standardized evaluation metrics, and advances the field of functional generative modeling.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

### [167] [A Minimalist Optimizer Design for LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16659)
*Athanasios Glentis,Jiaxiang Li,Andi Han,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCALE, a new optimizer combining column-normalized SGD and last-layer momentum, matches or exceeds Adam's performance while using only 35-45% of memory, outperforming other memory-efficient optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the minimal optimizer state needed for state-of-the-art performance in LLM pretraining, addressing memory constraints.

Method: Systematic investigation using column-wise gradient normalization and first-order momentum applied only to the output layer.

Result: SCALE outperforms Adam and other optimizers (GaLore, Fira, APOLLO) in performance and memory efficiency, especially for LLaMA models.

Conclusion: SCALE is a highly efficient optimizer for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints and serves as a minimalist baseline for future designs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

*Felix Zhou,Samson Zhou,Vahab Mirrokni,Alessandro Epasto,Vincent Cohen-Addad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for generating differentially private synthetic image embeddings using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) achieves SOTA classification accuracy and realistic image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in deep learning by preventing memorization of sensitive data through differential privacy (DP).

Method: Privately fit a GMM in an embedding space using DP clustering to generate synthetic datasets.

Result: Achieves SOTA classification accuracy and realistic synthetic images, scalable and adaptable to tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances privacy and performance, offering a general and scalable solution for DP synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high
performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially
sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have
been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information,
including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP)
provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a
new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the
input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any
subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP
synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method
provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple
two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic
images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA
methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be
freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable,
consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples
and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

*Sebastian Hönel,Jonas Nordqvist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes unsupervised machine learning methods to detect quality issues in industrial products, addressing challenges like low data quality and misleading metrics, and provides practical guidelines for practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection in industrial production is costly and error-prone, and existing machine learning methods often fail in real-world settings with low data quality.

Method: The study evaluates two state-of-the-art models for identifying subtle anomalies in low-quality RGB images of blasted forged metal parts, focusing on robustness and invariance issues.

Result: The paper highlights common pitfalls in likelihood-based approaches and introduces a framework for better empirical risk estimation in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The work provides practical guardrails for practitioners to improve anomaly detection in industrial settings and addresses shortcomings of current methods.

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware weighting function for diffusion models in offline RL, improving training efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models in offline RL suffer from high training costs, slow convergence, and unstable training due to ineffective loss weighting functions.

Method: The authors derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function and propose a closed-form polynomial approximation for online estimation, integrating it into a diffusion planning pipeline.

Result: Experiments on Maze2D and Kitchen benchmarks show the method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training steps.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances training efficiency and stability in diffusion-based offline RL.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using vector quantization (VQ) to create compact Semantic IDs (SIDs) for large-scale ad-recommendation systems, improving efficiency and reducing storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling large user histories (O(10^3) to O(10^4) in real-time prediction models is challenging due to storage and inference costs.

Method: Introduces (i) VQ fusion for multi-task embedding fusion, (ii) SIDE for SID-to-embedding conversion, and (iii) DPCA for enhanced quantization.

Result: Achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy gain and 3X reduction in data footprint.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses scaling challenges in industrial ad-recommendation systems.

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for
industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user
histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4)
events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained
models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due
to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we
propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a
compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a
collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by
introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ
fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into
a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding
conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding
collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup
table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which
generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed
enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system
achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in
data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the domain shattering dimension to quantify the number of domains needed for domain generalization, linking it to VC dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how many domains are required to learn a model that generalizes well across seen and unseen domains.

Method: Model the problem in the PAC framework and introduce the domain shattering dimension.

Result: The domain shattering dimension characterizes domain sample complexity and relates to VC dimension.

Conclusion: Any hypothesis class learnable in standard PAC is also learnable in this domain generalization setting.

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of
domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we
need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably
well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in
the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the
domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the
domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative
relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC
dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the
standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriCon-SF is a serial federated learning framework using triple shuffling and Shapley values to enhance privacy, robustness, and accountability in cross-silo settings, outperforming standard methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and robustness challenges in serial pipeline federated learning, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where model transfer risks leakage and malicious client behavior.

Method: Integrates triple shuffling (model layers, data segments, training sequences) and Shapley value-based contribution awareness to randomize learning and detect dishonest behavior.

Result: Outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in accuracy and communication efficiency on non-IID healthcare datasets, with proven resilience against privacy attacks.

Conclusion: TriCon-SF effectively enhances privacy, robustness, and accountability in federated learning, making it suitable for sensitive applications like healthcare.

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

*Fanchen Bu,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a misalignment between training and testing in unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO) and proposes integrating differentiable derandomization into training to improve alignment, though it introduces challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCO methods suffer from misalignment between training and testing, where lower training losses don't guarantee better post-derandomization performance, even without data shifts.

Method: The paper explores including a differentiable version of derandomization during training to align training and testing phases.

Result: Empirical results show improved training-test alignment but reveal new challenges in training.

Conclusion: Integrating differentiable derandomization helps align UCO training and testing but introduces complexities that need addressing.

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that Optimistic Fictitious Play achieves constant regret in two-strategy zero-sum games without regularization, unlike Alternating Fictitious Play, which has a regret lower bound of Ω(√T).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether non-no-regret algorithms like Optimistic Fictitious Play can achieve fast learning (constant regret) in zero-sum games without regularization.

Method: Analyzes Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of payoff vectors, using a geometric view and an energy function to prove bounded regret. Also compares it with Alternating Fictitious Play.

Result: Optimistic Fictitious Play achieves constant regret in two-strategy games, while Alternating Fictitious Play has a regret lower bound of Ω(√T).

Conclusion: Optimism enables fast learning (constant regret) without regularization, unlike alternation, which cannot achieve sublinear regret.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in
two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a
regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant
regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates
are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games
that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only
constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of
non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique
leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of
payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains
bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized
regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving

### [176] [IsoNet: Causal Analysis of Multimodal Transformers for Neuromuscular Gesture Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16744)
*Eion Tyacke,Kunal Gupta,Jay Patel,Rui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal fusion for decoding hand gestures using biosignals, comparing linear and attention-based fusion strategies. The Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion outperforms others, and cross-modal interactions contribute significantly to decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding hand gestures from neuromuscular signals is crucial for neuroscience and assistive technologies, but traditional methods rely on single modalities. Multimodal fusion can leverage complementary sensor data for better performance.

Method: The study compares linear and attention-based fusion across three architectures (Multimodal MLP, Multimodal Transformer, Hierarchical Transformer) using datasets NinaPro DB2 and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture. An Isolation Network analyzes modality interactions.

Result: The Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming baselines by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7% on HD-sEMG. Cross-modal interactions contributed ~30% to decisions.

Conclusion: Attention-driven multimodal fusion enhances biosignal classification, providing insights into human muscle activities and aiding neurorobotic system design.

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the
decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic
neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional
human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but
multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We
systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across
three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a
Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and
multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2
(sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force).
Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion
consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best
single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7%
on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation
Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways,
quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream
decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute
approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers,
highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing
complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and
how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides
mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial
in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

*Kosuke Nakanishi,Akihiro Kubo,Yuji Yasui,Shin Ishii*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel off-policy robust RL method addresses adversarial input observations by reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem, eliminating additional environmental interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods struggle with inefficiency due to mutual dependencies between agent and adversary, hindering off-policy development.

Method: Proposes a soft-constrained optimization approach, leveraging symmetric policy evaluation between agent and adversary.

Result: The method theoretically supports efficient adversarial learning without extra environmental interactions.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution for robust RL, with implementation available.

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

### [178] [Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16754)
*Jongmin Park,Seunghoon Han,Won-Yong Shin,Sungsu Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MHCL, a framework using multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture diverse structures in heterogeneous graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models use a single hyperbolic space, failing to capture diverse power-law structures.

Method: MHCL employs multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning to preserve semantic discriminability of metapath embeddings.

Result: MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in graph machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: MHCL effectively captures complex structures in heterogeneous graphs by leveraging multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning.

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

### [179] [What Is the Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16782)
*Youjin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the focus on distributive equality in fair-ML research, advocating for a broader egalitarian framework that includes relational equality to address structural inequality and representational harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fair-ML research primarily relies on distributive equality, which inadequately addresses representational harms and structural inequality. The paper seeks to provide a more comprehensive ethical foundation.

Method: The paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework integrating distributive and relational equality, drawing on critical social and political philosophy.

Result: The framework offers a more holistic approach to fairness in ML, addressing both allocative and representational harms, and suggests practical implementation pathways.

Conclusion: A broader egalitarian approach is necessary to tackle the full spectrum of harms in ML systems, fostering relational equality alongside distributive fairness.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

*Jiashun Cheng,Aochuan Chen,Nuo Chen,Ziqi Gao,Yuhan Li,Jia Li,Fugee Tsung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeLoRA improves LoRA by reducing parameter redundancy using spectral bases, enhancing efficiency and performance without losing expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter redundancy in LoRA limits its capacity and efficiency, prompting the need for a more effective fine-tuning method.

Method: SeLoRA re-parameterizes LoRA using spectral bases from a sparse spectral subspace, integrating seamlessly with existing LoRA variants.

Result: SeLoRA achieves better efficiency and performance with fewer parameters across tasks like commonsense reasoning and code generation.

Conclusion: SeLoRA is a scalable, plug-and-play framework that outperforms baselines by leveraging spectral encoding to reduce redundancy.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial
parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has
been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate
the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density
redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce
\underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank
\underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of
spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace.
Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA
variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play
framework. Extensive experiments substantiate that SeLoRA achieves greater
efficiency with fewer parameters, delivering superior performance enhancements
over strong baselines on various downstream tasks, including commonsense
reasoning, math reasoning, and code generation.

*Senmiao Wang,Yupeng Chen,Yushun Zhang,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPoGInit, an initialization method for GNNs to improve signal propagation (SP) and address performance degradation in deep networks. It proposes three SP metrics and shows SPoGInit's superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from performance degradation with increasing depth, prompting the need for better initialization methods to enhance signal propagation.

Method: The paper proposes SPoGInit, which optimizes three SP metrics (forward/backward propagation and graph embedding variation) by adjusting weight initialization variances.

Result: SPoGInit outperforms common initialization methods, enabling performance improvements as GNNs deepen.

Conclusion: SPoGInit effectively addresses depth-related challenges in GNNs, validating the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the
network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing
initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We
propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation,
backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two
metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for
GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used
initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with
increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal
with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for
weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to
significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal
Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments
demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on
various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance
improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in
addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and
effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabArena introduces a continuously maintained benchmarking system for tabular data, addressing flaws in static benchmarks by curating datasets, models, and a leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for tabular data are static and not updated, leading to outdated evaluations. TabArena aims to provide a dynamic, reliable solution.

Method: TabArena manually curates datasets and models, conducts large-scale benchmarking, and establishes a maintenance team. It evaluates validation methods, ensembling, and model performance.

Result: Gradient-boosted trees remain strong, but deep learning catches up with larger budgets. Foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Ensembles advance state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: TabArena offers a living benchmark with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols to ensure up-to-date evaluations in tabular ML.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

*Kai Yang,Shaoyu Dou,Pan Luo,Xin Wang,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes seq2GMM, a framework for identifying unusual quasi-periodic time series in networks, outperforming existing anomaly detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and understand anomalous quasi-periodic time series in networks with timing variations.

Method: Develops seq2GMM, a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model framework, and a surrogate-based optimization algorithm for training.

Result: Seq2GMM outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for anomaly detection in quasi-periodic time series, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of
physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The
quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar
repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in
different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude
of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to
identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the
observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how
the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model
(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify
unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We
further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently
train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a
plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the
convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical
results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

TL;DR: LLMs are used to extract concepts from materials science abstracts, building a concept graph to predict new research ideas, outperforming keyword extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The overwhelming volume of research makes it hard for scientists to track all publications, even in their field.

Method: LLMs extract semantic concepts to build a concept graph; a machine learning model predicts emerging concept combinations.

Result: LLMs outperform keyword extraction; integrating semantic info improves prediction performance.

Conclusion: The model inspires materials scientists by predicting innovative, unexplored topic combinations.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is
impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within
their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large
language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and
semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials
science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest
inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can
extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to
build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine
learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e.
new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating
semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The
applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with
domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the
model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by
predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been
investigated.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedFitTech, a federated learning baseline for wearable fitness tracking, addressing privacy and efficiency challenges while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized learning for fitness activity detection faces privacy, regulatory, and communication issues. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized alternative but presents challenges like data imbalance and personalization trade-offs.

Method: The paper presents the FedFitTech baseline under the Flower framework, featuring a client-side early stopping strategy and a case study to demonstrate its application.

Result: The system reduces redundant communications by 13% with only a 1% recognition cost, balancing common activity patterns and individual nuances.

Conclusion: FedFitTech provides a scalable, privacy-aware foundation for FitTech research, available as open-source.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models
have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices.
Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical
movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports
optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning
approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,
regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast,
Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating
model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech
presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,
heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization
and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the
FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available
and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to
illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system
based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping
strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable
devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity
patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the
scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications.
Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent,
while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible
recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation
for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and
it is available as open-source at:

### [186] [Bandwidth Selectors on Semiparametric Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16844)
*Victor Alejandre,Concha Bielza,Pedro Larrañaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates advanced bandwidth selectors for semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) to improve density estimation and predictive performance, outperforming the traditional normal rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often deviates from normality, making the normal rule suboptimal for bandwidth selection in SPBNs. The paper aims to enhance SPBN performance by exploring better bandwidth selectors.

Method: The study applies cross-validation and plug-in bandwidth selectors, extends the PyBNesian package for SPBNs, and conducts experiments to compare these methods with the normal rule.

Result: Advanced bandwidth selectors, especially unbiased cross-validation, outperform the normal rule, particularly with larger datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed bandwidth selectors improve SPBN performance, with unbiased cross-validation being the most effective for high sample sizes.

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

*Antonio Consoloa,Edoardo Amaldi,Emilio Carrizosa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new soft survival tree model (SST) is proposed, offering interpretability and flexibility by using soft splitting rules and nonlinear optimization. It outperforms benchmarks in survival analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve survival analysis by combining interpretability of decision trees with global optimization and flexibility in survival function modeling.

Method: SST uses soft splitting rules and nonlinear optimization, allowing any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) to be used. Training involves node-based decomposition.

Result: SST outperforms three benchmark survival trees on 15 datasets in discrimination and calibration measures.

Conclusion: SST provides a flexible, interpretable, and high-performing approach to survival analysis, with potential for fairness extensions.

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability
and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the
timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built
through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in
globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the
error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree
model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a
nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs
provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a
single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit
the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with
interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or
nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf
node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are
associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15
well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based
semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the
node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft
regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four
widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended
to consider group fairness.

*Semin Kim,Yeonwoo Cha,Jaehoon Yoo,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RATTPO is a reward-agnostic method for optimizing prompts in text-to-image models, outperforming specialized baselines in efficiency and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt engineering methods are limited to specific reward models, leading to suboptimal performance in new scenarios.

Method: RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts using LLMs and a reward-aware feedback signal, without requiring reward-specific task descriptions.

Result: RATTPO enhances prompts across diverse reward setups, uses fewer inference budgets, and matches performance of fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: RATTPO offers a flexible and efficient solution for prompt optimization in text-to-image models.

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function
specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating
image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically
target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs
exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios
involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce
RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time
optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without
modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying
large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task
descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel
reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results
demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts
across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as
aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects.
RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using
up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget,
achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require
reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised learning framework for measuring similarities in event-triggered time series, combining hierarchical autoencoders and GMM, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity metrics for event-triggered time series in cybersecurity tasks like anomaly detection are unclear, necessitating a robust unsupervised framework.

Method: Uses hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn low-dimensional representations of time series.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic approach for similarity learning in event-triggered time series, with potential applications in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as
intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among
multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for
downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the
event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric
is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised
learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of
event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the
proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution
sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively
learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the
obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The
proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a
systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of
event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

*Qian Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework to determine the optimal depth of neural networks by modeling the forward pass as an optimal stopping problem, proving finite stopping depth under diminishing returns, and proposing a practical regularization term for early exiting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of determining neural network depth is typically addressed through costly experimentation. This work aims to provide a formal theoretical solution.

Method: The forward pass of a ResNet is recast as an optimal stopping problem, with a sequential decision process for halting or continuing computation. A regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm depth}$, is introduced to encourage early exiting.

Result: Theoretical proof shows finite optimal stopping depth under diminishing returns. Empirical validation on ImageNet confirms improved computational efficiency without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances accuracy and computational cost, extending to Transformers and continuous-depth models, with practical benefits demonstrated.

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet
challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive
experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to
address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,
specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We
model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential
decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting
computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a
potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the
intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary
theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of
diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping
depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this
insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to
efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by
extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to
continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on
ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically
predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency

*Jacopo Graldi,Alessandro Breccia,Giulia Lanzillotta,Thomas Hofmann,Lorenzo Noci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reconciles contradictory findings on model scale's impact in continual learning by differentiating lazy vs. rich training regimes, showing width benefits only with reduced feature learning. It extends theoretical understanding of catastrophic forgetting (CF) to feature learning regimes and identifies optimal feature learning levels for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role of model scale and feature learning in continual learning, addressing gaps in understanding catastrophic forgetting (CF) and reconciling conflicting observations in the literature.

Method: Systematic study using variable parameterization to differentiate lazy and rich training regimes, analyzing infinite width dynamics with dynamical mean field theory, and examining task similarity's impact on feature learning and forgetting.

Result: Increasing model width helps only when it reduces feature learning (laziness). High feature learning benefits similar tasks but causes significant forgetting otherwise. Optimal performance occurs at a critical feature learning level, dependent on task non-stationarity.

Conclusion: The study unifies perspectives on scale and feature learning in continual learning, highlighting the importance of balancing feature learning and task similarity to mitigate CF and optimize performance.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models, especially LSTM, achieve high accuracy (99%) in predicting neonatal mortality, aiding early intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High neonatal mortality rates globally necessitate early prediction to save lives.

Method: Used historical data of 1.4M newborns; tested ML (XGBoost, random forest) and DL (CNN, LSTM) models.

Result: LSTM outperformed with 99% accuracy; XGBoost and random forest achieved 94%.

Conclusion: LSTM is the most effective for predicting neonatal mortality and enabling timely care.

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

### [193] [RocketStack: A level-aware deep recursive ensemble learning framework with exploratory feature fusion and model pruning dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16965)
*Çağatay Demirel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RocketStack introduces a level-aware recursive ensemble framework for deep stacking, addressing challenges like complexity and redundancy through pruning, noise addition, and feature compression, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in deep stacking (e.g., complexity, redundancy, computational burden) and explore deeper ensemble architectures beyond current designs.

Method: RocketStack employs recursive stacking with incremental pruning of weaker learners, mild Gaussian noise for OOF scores, and feature compression techniques (attention-based, SFE filter, autoencoders).

Result: Improved accuracy with depth, outperforming standalone ensembles: 97.08% (binary) and 98.60% (multi-class) at level 10, with reduced runtime and feature dimensionality.

Conclusion: Mild randomization and periodic compression are effective for deep recursive ensembling, balancing performance and complexity.

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking
used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.
However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal
diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and
computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware
recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking
levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally
prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without
excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian
noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against
strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions
are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)
filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),
linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and
the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the
strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild
OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the
strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no
compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached
98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing
runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.
These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and
periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets
in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive
ensembling with tractable complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of narrowing large combinatorial sets in scientific discovery by introducing a robust RL approach to handle uncertain proxy reward functions, yielding higher-quality, diverse candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the filtering process in scientific discovery, which often relies on uncertain proxy reward functions, leading to suboptimal candidate selection in large search spaces.

Method: The authors propose a robust RL approach with a unified operator that accounts for reward function uncertainty, targeting peakier sampling distributions and encompassing soft RL operators.

Result: The method identifies higher-quality, diverse candidates in synthetic and real-world tasks, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The work provides a flexible perspective for discrete compositional generation tasks, enhancing scientific discovery processes.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large
combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of
promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge,
recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering.
They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets
and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward
functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge
for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often
framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield
suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue,
we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks
robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general
operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft
RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies
higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks.
Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete
compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

*Giulia Bertazzini,Chiara Albisani,Daniele Baracchi,Dasara Shullani,Roberto Verdecchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the environmental impact of AI image generation by comparing energy consumption across 17 models, analyzing factors like model type, resolution, and quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hidden environmental costs of AI image generation and understand how different factors influence energy use.

Method: A comprehensive empirical experiment comparing 17 state-of-the-art models, evaluating energy consumption against factors like model quantization, resolution, and prompt length, alongside image quality metrics.

Result: Energy consumption varies widely (up to 46x difference). Resolution inconsistently affects energy (1.3x–4.7x increase). U-Net models are more efficient than Transformers. Quantization reduces efficiency, while prompt length has no impact. High-quality images don't always require more energy.

Conclusion: AI image generation's energy impact varies significantly by model and factors like resolution. Some high-quality models are energy-efficient, suggesting optimization opportunities.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the
ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer
a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each
image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical
experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation.
Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by
considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such
as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we
consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs
between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image
generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up
to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption
inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution.
U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model
quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most
models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant
impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher
energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality
images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

TL;DR: MARL-OD-DA, a scalable and reliable MARL framework for traffic assignment, outperforms traditional methods by redefining agents as OD pair routers and improving convergence efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and reliability challenges of MARL in large-scale traffic assignment problems.

Method: Introduces MARL-OD-DA with OD pair routers, Dirichlet-based action space, and a local relative gap reward function.

Result: Achieves 94.99% lower relative gap in 10 steps on the SiouxFalls network compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: MARL-OD-DA is effective for medium-sized networks with varied city-level OD demand, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.

TL;DR: A scoping review identifies 62 fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI, revealing fragmentation, limited validation, and gaps in clinical relevance and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear definition of fairness in AI and its risks of perpetuating biases in clinical practice.

Method: Conducted a scoping review of five databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records to include 41 studies and extract 62 fairness metrics.

Result: Found a fragmented landscape of fairness metrics, with limited clinical validation and overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Only one clinical utility metric was identified.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on clinically meaningful fairness metrics, addressing gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve
clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if
fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness"
remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically
appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness
metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally)
against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five
databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and
extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by
performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric,
revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and
overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly
developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our
findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness
and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and
real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful
metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable Lomb-Scargle layer is introduced for computing power spectra of irregularly sampled data, integrated into a score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for accurate time series imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of missing or irregularly sampled data in time series, which frequency-domain methods like FFT struggle with due to their reliance on uniform sampling.

Method: Proposes a differentiable Lomb-Scargle layer for spectral computation and integrates it into a score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for imputation, leveraging the full signal spectrum.

Result: Outperforms time-domain baselines in accuracy for missing data recovery and provides consistent frequency estimates.

Conclusion: The method enables spectral guidance in machine learning for incomplete or irregular data, with potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAWIFlow is a flow-based benchmark for anomaly detection, derived from real-world traffic (MAWILab v1.1), addressing limitations of synthetic datasets. It includes temporally distinct samples and evaluates traditional ML vs. deep learning (CNN-BiLSTM), showing better generalization with the latter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks use synthetic traffic, lacking realism and temporal variability. MAWIFlow aims to provide a realistic, reproducible alternative for evaluating anomaly detection methods.

Method: A reproducible pipeline converts raw packet captures into flow representations (CICFlowMeter format), preserving anomaly labels. Datasets include samples from 2011, 2016, and 2021. Traditional ML and CNN-BiLSTM models are compared.

Result: Tree-based classifiers perform well on static data but degrade over time, while CNN-BiLSTM maintains better performance, demonstrating improved generalization.

Conclusion: Realistic datasets with temporal structure are crucial for robust anomaly detection. MAWIFlow and its resources are publicly available to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on
synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical
variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This
paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1
dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly
detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that
transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic
benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets
with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model
implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and
reproducibility.

*Haolin Liu,Adrien Siproudhis,Samuel Experton,Peter Lorenz,Christina Boura,Thomas Peyrin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper refines neural network signature extraction, addressing limitations of prior work to enable deeper network extraction with higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for neural network parameter extraction were limited to shallow networks due to issues like rank deficiency and noise propagation. This work aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose algorithmic solutions to address identified issues in signature extraction, improving efficiency and enabling deeper network extraction.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements, with extracted networks matching target networks on 95% of inputs for eight layers, surpassing prior work's three-layer limit.

Conclusion: This work advances practical attacks on deeper and more complex neural networks, demonstrating substantial progress in extraction depth and accuracy.

Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important
security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via
black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which
aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.
Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired
by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,
their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability
to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign
extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction
itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by
systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical
limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations
include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome
these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the
identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.
Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously
possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based
neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and
accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at
least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the
first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical
attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

TL;DR: FANTOM is a framework for causal discovery in non-stationary, non-Gaussian, and heteroscedastic time series, identifying regime shifts and causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series with multiple regimes and complex noise distributions is challenging due to non-stationarity and noise complexity.

Method: FANTOM uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm to infer regimes and their causal graphs, maximizing data log likelihood.

Result: Theoretical proofs show identifiability, and experiments demonstrate FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: FANTOM effectively addresses challenges in causal discovery for non-stationary and complex noise scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the identifiability of deep Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs), revealing how activation degrees and layer widths interact to ensure identifiability, with constructive proofs based on tensor decompositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the identifiability of PNNs is crucial for their interpretability, yet this property remains poorly understood.

Method: The study uses a connection between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, leveraging Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems for proofs.

Result: Architectures with non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions, and encoder-decoder networks are identifiable if decoder widths don't grow too rapidly.

Conclusion: The work provides generic and effective conditions for PNN identifiability, resolves a conjecture on neurovarieties' dimensions, and offers new bounds on activation degrees.

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

TL;DR: Proposes SRCTE, a Siamese-enabled framework for rapid, continuous trust evaluation in collaborative systems using ACFGs and a Siamese model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of dynamically evaluating collaborators' trustworthiness due to distributed devices and changing environments.

Method: Uses ACFGs to represent trust-related data and a Siamese model to compare embeddings for trust evaluation.

Result: SRCTE converges quickly with minimal data and achieves high anomaly detection rates.

Conclusion: SRCTE effectively enhances trust evaluation in collaborative systems.

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

TL;DR: Diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions show inconsistencies in generated samples and forces. A proposed energy-based model with Fokker-Planck regularization improves consistency and sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistencies in diffusion models when used for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, particularly at small timesteps, by ensuring adherence to the Fokker-Planck equation.

Method: Introduce an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency between generated samples and simulations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on toy systems and alanine dipeptide, achieving enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves the reliability of diffusion models for molecular dynamics simulations, offering a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of

*Samin Yeasar Arnob,Scott Fujimoto,Doina Precup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores offline RL with small datasets, introduces 'Sparse-Reg' to prevent overfitting, and shows improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many offline RL applications use small datasets, but current benchmarks focus on large datasets, leading to overfitting issues.

Method: Introduces 'Sparse-Reg', a sparsity-based regularization technique for offline RL to mitigate overfitting in small datasets.

Result: Sparse-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control tasks with limited data.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg effectively addresses overfitting in small offline RL datasets, enhancing performance in data-limited settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified theory views deep generative models as probability transformation functions, linking diverse architectures like autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that all generative models fundamentally transform simple distributions into complex data distributions, despite architectural differences.

Method: Proposes a theoretical perspective unifying various generative models by their shared probability transformation function.

Result: Shows that methodological improvements can transfer across architectures, enabling more efficient generative modeling.

Conclusion: This unifying perspective lays groundwork for universal theoretical approaches and improved generative techniques.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.

*Yuli Slavutsky,Ozgur Beker,David Blei,Bianca Dumitrascu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCoVeR is a new variational framework for disentangling condition-invariant and condition-specific factors in data, improving generalization in multi-condition settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address leakage in latent representations of existing VAE extensions, which limits generalization to unseen conditions.

Method: Introduces DISCoVeR with a dual-latent architecture, parallel reconstructions, and a max-min objective for clean separation.

Result: Achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data.

Conclusion: DISCoVeR is a principled approach for learning disentangled representations in multi-condition settings.

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation
that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are
condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical
data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species
depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects.
While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been
proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between
latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen
conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that
explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors.
DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that
models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel
reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii)
a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on
handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we
show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting
disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic
datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results
establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled
representations in multi-condition settings.

### [209] [Optimal Implicit Bias in Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17187)
*Kanumuri Nithin Varma,Babak Hassibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the implicit bias of optimization algorithms in over-parameterized linear regression, identifying the optimal bias for best generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which implicit bias in optimization leads to the best generalization in over-parameterized settings.

Method: Asymptotic analysis of generalization performance for interpolators from convex potential minimization in non-isotropic Gaussian data.

Result: A tight lower bound on generalization error is derived, and the optimal convex implicit bias achieving this bound is identified under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into optimal implicit bias for generalization in over-parameterized linear regression.

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of
learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points.
In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely
many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying
generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to
depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we
address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best
generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a
precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators
obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for
over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In
particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error
possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the
over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the
eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the
parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias
that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving
the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of
the true underlying parameter.

*Guozheng Ma,Lu Li,Zilin Wang,Li Shen,Pierre-Luc Bacon,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing static network sparsity via one-shot random pruning improves scaling and efficiency in deep reinforcement learning, outperforming dense networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep reinforcement learning is challenging due to network pathologies; existing solutions like periodic reset or architectural changes are complex.

Method: One-shot random pruning removes a fixed percentage of network weights before training, creating sparse networks.

Result: Sparse networks achieve higher parameter efficiency, better expressivity, and resistance to optimization issues like plasticity loss and gradient interference.

Conclusion: Static sparsity is a simple yet effective solution for scaling DRL, with consistent benefits across visual and streaming RL scenarios.

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

*Xuechen Zhang,Zijian Huang,Yingcong Li,Chenshun Ni,Jiasi Chen,Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREAD improves SLM reasoning by unifying SFT and RL stages with expert guidance and branched rollouts, outperforming GRPO with fewer traces and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs struggle with complex reasoning due to scarce or difficult-to-learn traces, and the SFT + RL paradigm can fail under certain conditions.

Method: Introduces BREAD, a GRPO variant combining SFT and RL via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts, inserting expert hints when needed.

Result: BREAD requires <40% of ground-truth traces, outperforms GRPO, speeds up training by 3x, and solves problems unsolvable by SFT + RL.

Conclusion: BREAD's branched rollouts and expert guidance significantly enhance SLM reasoning, addressing limitations of the SFT + RL approach.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors,
especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The
standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often
to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning
(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose
methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate
that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are
too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's
initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,
we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via
partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,
BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model
to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update
includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the
reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer
than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while
speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that
BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +
RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can
substantially boost SLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLIF (Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback) uses intrinsic signals like token-level entropy to improve LLM reasoning, matching RLVR early but degrading later, especially for instruction-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore intrinsic feedback (RLIF) as an alternative to externally supervised methods (RLHF, RLVR) for improving LLM reasoning.

Method: Leverages unsupervised reward proxies (token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, self-certainty) and evaluates RLIF on math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: RLIF boosts early reasoning performance but degrades later, even below pre-training levels, and shows minimal gains for instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: RLIF's effectiveness is limited post-instruction-tuning; guidelines are provided for integrating internal feedback into LLM training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A view-free, attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network is proposed for single-view image guided point cloud completion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without relying on image guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the necessity of image guidance in single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) and propose a strong baseline without it.

Method: An attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network with hierarchical self-fusion (cross-attention and self-attention layers) for integrating information from partial point clouds.

Result: The view-free framework outperforms state-of-the-art SVIPC methods on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the necessity of image guidance in SVIPC and offer insights for multimodal learning development.

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMInferSlow evaluates Vision-Language Models' efficiency robustness in a black-box setting, addressing gaps in prior unrealistic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on VLM accuracy, neglecting efficiency robustness, which is critical for real-time applications.

Method: Proposes VLMInferSlow, combining fine-grained efficiency modeling and zero-order optimization to find adversarial examples.

Result: Generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations, increasing computational cost by up to 128.47%.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for efficiency robustness awareness in VLMs, especially in ML-as-a-service settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL) to improve Visual Language Navigation (VLN) by integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge without fine-tuning, addressing challenges like dynamic viewpoints and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle with dynamic viewpoints, lack domain knowledge in pre-trained models, and face high computational costs when fine-tuning.

Method: WPCL integrates pre-trained VLM knowledge into perception without fine-tuning, enhancing object identification from dynamic viewpoints.

Result: WPCL outperforms baselines on benchmarks, showing effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability.

Conclusion: WPCL offers a computationally efficient solution to VLN challenges, improving performance without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based 3D scene reconstruction method using LiDAR and deep neural networks improves obstacle mapping in dense urban traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current technologies lack accuracy in 3D scene reconstruction for autonomous vehicles in dense traffic, especially for boundary-level details.

Method: Uses LiDAR data and a deep neural network to create static Signed Distance Function (SDF) maps, avoiding traditional polygonal representations.

Result: Preliminary results show enhanced collision detection in congested and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed SDF-based method offers more detailed 3D obstacle mapping, improving autonomous navigation safety.

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

TL;DR: ADAM-Dehaze is an adaptive dehazing framework that improves image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities, outperforming benchmarks in PSNR, FADE, and mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fog degrades visual information for autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: Uses a Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) to classify fog intensity and routes images through tailored CORUN branches. Introduces an adaptive loss for balance between physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity.

Result: Improves PSNR by 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30%, increases mAP by 13 points, and cuts inference time by 20%.

Conclusion: ADAM-Dehaze demonstrates the effectiveness of intensity-specific processing and integration with vision tasks.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

TL;DR: EchoShot is a multi-shot framework for portrait video generation, enhancing identity consistency and content control using a video diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require multi-shot video generation with identity consistency and flexible control, which existing single-shot pipelines lack.

Method: Proposes shot-aware position embedding in a video diffusion transformer to model inter-shot variations and text-video correspondence, trained on the PortraitGala dataset.

Result: Achieves superior identity consistency and attribute-level controllability in multi-shot video generation, with potential for general multi-shot modeling.

Conclusion: EchoShot is a scalable and effective framework for multi-shot portrait video generation, demonstrating foundational potential.

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

*Dominic Akt,Marco Peer,Florian Kleber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares traditional and DL-based binarization methods for Greek papyri, evaluating their impact on writer identification. DL methods with data augmentation show better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writer identification in Greek papyri is challenging due to non-uniform backgrounds. Effective binarization is crucial to avoid learning irrelevant features.

Method: Traditional and DL binarization methods are compared, with DL models trained using custom data augmentation. Performance is evaluated on DIBCO 2019 and downstream writer identification.

Result: DL methods with data augmentation outperform traditional methods. Binarization quality strongly correlates with writer identification performance.

Conclusion: Data augmentation enhances DL binarization, which significantly improves writer identification for Greek papyri.

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Ahmad Patooghy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using reinforcement learning and vision-language models converts AIE camera images into text to preserve privacy while retaining scene-relevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in CAVs from AIE cameras, as traditional methods like face blurring fail to fully protect against tracking via other features.

Method: Uses feedback-based RL and VLMs to transform images into semantically equivalent text, refined hierarchically for accuracy and privacy.

Result: Improves privacy protection and textual quality, with Unique Word Count up 77% and Detail Density up 50% over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy and information retention, offering a robust solution for CAV applications.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

*Rim Assouel,Declan Campbell,Taylor Webb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how vision language models (VLMs) solve the 'binding problem' using symbolic, content-independent mechanisms, identifying failures in these mechanisms as the cause of binding errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether VLMs employ similar symbolic mechanisms as language models to solve the binding problem, given their persistent failures in binding tasks.

Method: Investigating emergent symbolic mechanisms in VLMs, specifically a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme, and tracing binding errors to failures in these mechanisms.

Result: Identified symbolic mechanisms in VLMs that support binding, with binding errors linked to failures in these mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how VLMs process symbols and suggest potential solutions to their binding failures.

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

### [223] [MoiréXNet: Adaptive Multi-Scale Demoiréing with Linear Attention Test-Time Training and Truncated Flow Matching Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15929)
*Liangyan Li,Yimo Ning,Kevin Le,Wei Dong,Yunzhe Li,Jun Chen,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid MAP-based framework combines supervised learning with deep learning for better image and video demoiréing, addressing nonlinear degradation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with nonlinear moiré patterns due to limited model capacity and training data, leading to incomplete removal or overly smooth results.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework: 1) Supervised learning with linear attention TTT modules for RAW-to-sRGB demoiréing, and 2) TFMP to refine outputs by aligning with clean image distribution.

Result: The framework improves restoration by combining efficiency of linear attention with generative refinement, enhancing high-frequency details and reducing artifacts.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses nonlinear demoiréing challenges, outperforming traditional and generative methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

*Yosub Shin,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoSync is a video synchronization framework that outperforms prior methods by avoiding reliance on specific features, correcting biases, and introducing reproducible benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on unreliable audio or visual cues, and existing benchmarks lack generality and reproducibility, limiting progress in video synchronization.

Method: VideoSync operates independently of specific feature extraction methods and is evaluated on diverse datasets (single-human, multi-human, non-human). Biases in prior work are corrected, and a CNN-based model is identified as the most effective for synchronization.

Result: VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair conditions. The framework is more generalizable and robust.

Conclusion: VideoSync advances video synchronization by addressing biases, improving reproducibility, and enhancing performance, making it suitable for broader real-world applications.

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

*Zhongchen Zhao,Chaodong Xiao,Hui Lin,Qi Xie,Lei Zhang,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA), combining ViTs' self-attention with Mamba2's structured mask to enhance spatial adjacency modeling in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing architectures in global dependency and spatial position modeling by integrating the strengths of Vision Transformers and Mamba2.

Method: Introduces a 2D polyline path scanning strategy to improve Mamba2's structured mask, embeds it into ViTs' self-attention, and provides an efficient algorithm for mask computation.

Result: PPMA outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like ADE20K, achieving 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: PPMA effectively combines global dependency and spatial adjacency modeling, demonstrating superior performance in vision tasks.

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our
proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K
semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/zhongchenzhao/PPMA.

*Jiawen Yang,Shuhao Chen,Yucong Duan,Ke Tang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HMUDA and LSB for domain adaptation between entirely distinct modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of UDA when source and target domains are of entirely distinct modalities.

Method: Introduces HMUDA setting and LSB framework with dual-branch architecture, feature consistency loss, and domain alignment loss.

Result: LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LSB effectively enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [227] [LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976)
*Jingwei Zhang,Xi Han,Hong Qin,Mahdi S. Hosseini,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LBMamba introduces a locally bi-directional SSM block to avoid extra backward scans, improving efficiency while maintaining performance in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods use bi-directional scans to restore full receptive fields, doubling computational load and reducing efficiency.

Method: LBMamba embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan, executed in per-thread registers. LBVim alternates scan directions every two layers for global receptive fields.

Result: LBVim outperforms in accuracy (0.8%-1.6% on ImageNet), mIoU (0.6%-2.7% on ADE20K), and AP (0.9%-1.1% on COCO). LBMamba also improves WSI classification (up to 3.06% AUC).

Conclusion: LBMamba and LBVim offer superior performance-throughput trade-offs, validating their efficiency and effectiveness in vision tasks.

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

TL;DR: A novel method classifies microscopy images as time series using Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW) and attention-based pooling, achieving reliable performance in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopic pathology images are crucial for cancer diagnosis but underutilized in deep learning. The paper addresses challenges like manual acquisition and weak labeling.

Method: Proposes classifying microscopy images as time series with DTW to handle varying lengths and attention-based pooling for class prediction.

Result: Outperforms baselines, with ablation studies validating each component's contribution. Stable and reliable results are achieved.

Conclusion: The approach advances medical image analysis by improving the trustworthiness and performance of microscopy image classification.

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of
performance.

*Cong Wang,Zexuan Deng,Zhiwei Jiang,Fei Shen,Yafeng Yin,Shiwei Gan,Zifeng Cheng,Shiping Ge,Qing Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignViP is a novel SLVG framework that uses multiple fine-grained conditions for better sign language video generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLVG methods rely on single coarse conditions, limiting video naturalness and expressiveness. SignViP aims to overcome this by incorporating fine-grained conditions.

Method: SignViP uses a Sign Video Diffusion Model, FSQ Autoencoder, and Multi-Condition Token Translator to translate spoken language text into discrete tokens for video generation.

Result: SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: SignViP improves SLVG by leveraging fine-grained conditions and discrete tokenization, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

*Connor Malone,Owen Claxton,Iman Shames,Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial attacks on Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems, proposes an Adversarial Attack Detector (AAD) framework, and demonstrates its performance benefits in robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing risks in robot navigation. The study aims to address this by integrating AADs to enhance system robustness.

Method: The paper evaluates four common and four novel VPR-specific adversarial attacks, introduces an AAD framework, and tests it in a novel experiment paradigm.

Result: Adding AADs improves performance, e.g., reducing mean along-track error by ~50% with 75% True Positive and ≤25% False Positive rates.

Conclusion: AADs are crucial for trustworthy navigation, and the study provides quantitative design requirements for robust VPR systems.

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical geologic maps are valuable but digitizing them is labor-intensive. Automating this process supports renewable energy, electric vehicles, and national security.

Method: DIGMAPPER uses a dockerized, workflow-orchestrated architecture with deep learning models for layout analysis, feature extraction, and georeferencing, plus techniques like in-context learning and synthetic data generation.

Result: Evaluations on 100+ maps show high accuracy in feature extraction and georeferencing, with successful deployment at USGS.

Conclusion: DIGMAPPER accelerates geospatial dataset creation, aiding critical mineral assessments and geoscientific applications.

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

*Liangjing Shao,Linxin Bai,Chenkang Du,Xinrong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning improves self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing lighting variations and sparse textures in endoscopic scenes for accurate robot-assisted navigation.

Method: Three-step training process: optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition, and multiple transformation alignments, with parameter-efficient finetuning.

Result: Achieves 4%∼10% lower error on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles illumination issues and information interference, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAROAttention reorganizes visual attention patterns into block-wise forms to simplify sparsification and quantization, achieving high efficiency with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in visual generation leads to high costs, and existing techniques struggle with low density and reduced bitwidths due to irregular attention patterns.

Method: Proposes PARO, a technique to reorganize attention patterns into hardware-friendly block-wise forms, simplifying sparsification and quantization.

Result: Achieves lossless metrics in video/image generation at lower density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (INT8/INT4), with 1.9x-2.7x latency speedup.

Conclusion: PAROAttention effectively balances performance and efficiency by unifying attention patterns, enabling practical high-resolution visual generation.

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenBench, a new benchmark for open-vocabulary segmentation, and OVSNet, a method to improve segmentation performance in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to measure models' comprehension of truly open-vocabulary concepts due to semantic overlap with training data.

Method: Proposes OVSNet, which fuses heterogeneous features and expands the training space cost-free.

Result: OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing datasets and OpenBench.

Conclusion: OpenBench and OVSNet effectively address limitations in evaluating and improving open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

*Yucheng Jin,Jinyan Chen,Ziyue He,Baojun Han,Furan An*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR-Pose is a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework for low-resolution video-based human pose estimation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos is challenging due to conventional methods' reliance on high-quality inputs or expensive cascaded processing.

Method: STAR-Pose uses a spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention and an adaptive fusion module with a parallel CNN branch. It employs a pose-aware compound loss for task-oriented super-resolution.

Result: STAR-Pose achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under 64x48 resolution and is 2.8x to 4.4x faster than cascaded approaches.

Conclusion: STAR-Pose effectively addresses low-resolution video pose estimation with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

*Byung Hoon Lee,Wooseok Shin,Sung Won Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TD3Net, a backend architecture for lipreading, combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated convolutions to address blind spots in receptive fields, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TCN-based methods suffer from blind spots in receptive fields, leading to information loss in modeling continuous lip movements.

Method: Proposes TD3Net, using dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions to ensure a wide, dense receptive field without blind spots.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LRW and LRW-1000 datasets with higher accuracy, fewer parameters, and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: TD3Net effectively models temporal continuity in lip movements, offering a lightweight yet powerful solution for lipreading systems.

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

### [237] [PR-DETR: Injecting Position and Relation Prior for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16082)
*Yizhe Li,Sanping Zhou,Zheng Qin,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PR-DETR improves dense video captioning by injecting explicit position and relation priors into a detection transformer, enhancing localization and caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods for dense video captioning implicitly learn event locations and semantics, requiring large datasets and limiting performance.

Method: PR-DETR uses position-anchored queries for scene-specific position prior and an event relation encoder for relation prior to guide event interaction.

Result: The method shows competitive performance on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit position and relation priors significantly improve dense video captioning performance.

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

*Yuan Zhang,Chun-Kai Fan,Tao Huang,Ming Lu,Sicheng Yu,Junwen Pan,Kuan Cheng,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoV automates the selection of optimal visual prompts for LVLMs, improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design of visual prompts for LVLMs is inefficient and sub-optimal, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: AutoV learns to select the best visual prompt from candidates using a data pipeline and LVLM-generated rankings.

Result: AutoV boosts LVLM performance, e.g., 1.7% gain for LLaVA-OV and 1.9% for Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: AutoV is an effective automated visual prompting method for enhancing LVLM capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastInit introduces a fast noise initialization method for video generation, eliminating iterative refinement and improving efficiency and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of high computational cost and temporal inconsistency in video generation with diffusion models.

Method: FastInit uses a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) to generate refined noise in a single forward pass, trained on a large-scale dataset of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise pairs.

Result: FastInit enhances video generation efficiency and quality, achieving high temporal consistency across frames in various text-to-video models.

Conclusion: FastInit offers a practical and efficient solution for video generation, with potential for direct application during inference.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

*Stefano Colamonaco,David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepObjectLog learns object-centric representations from raw data using distant supervision, combining perception and symbolic reasoning for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems require object-level supervision or predefined decompositions, limiting flexibility. The goal is to learn object-centric representations directly from raw data with minimal supervision.

Method: Proposes DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model with a perceptual module for object extraction and a symbolic reasoning layer using probabilistic logic programming.

Result: Outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines in generalization tasks like unseen object compositions, tasks, and object counts.

Conclusion: DeepObjectLog demonstrates effective learning of object-centric representations from raw data, enhancing generalization without heavy supervision.

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

*Yi Chen,Yuying Ge,Rui Wang,Yixiao Ge,Junhao Cheng,Ying Shan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework, improves answer correctness and reasoning coherence in MLLMs, outperforming standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods and the shortcomings of standard GRPO in maintaining logical coherence.

Method: Introduces GRPO-CARE with a two-tiered reward system: base reward for answer correctness and adaptive consistency bonus for logical coherence.

Result: GRPO-CARE achieves a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency.

Conclusion: GRPO-CARE and SEED-Bench-R1 advance the development of more interpretable and robust MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

*Xingbai Chen,Tingchao Fu,Renyang Liu,Wei Zhou,Chao Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adversarial attack method, Multimodal Bidirectional Attack, is proposed to improve robustness testing for Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models by addressing multimodal challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The robustness of RES models against adversarial examples is unexplored, and existing attack methods fail to expose vulnerabilities in their multimodal structure. Practical scenarios require adversarial examples that generalize across diverse textual inputs.

Method: The proposed method introduces learnable proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly optimizes image and textual modalities during attack generation, enhancing cross-text transferability.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method's superior effectiveness compared to existing approaches on multiple RES models and datasets.

Conclusion: The Multimodal Bidirectional Attack effectively addresses multimodal challenges in RES, improving adversarial robustness testing.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: With the advancement of conversational AI, research on bodily expressions,

*Jiyao Wang,Xiao Yang,Hao Lu,Dengbo He,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework (GAP) for multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) and test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) in remote physiological measurement, addressing challenges like partial labeling and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing generalizability and personalization in remote physiological measurement, overcoming gaps between generalization and personalization methods.

Method: Disentangling face video data into invariant semantics, individual bias, and noise; using priors and observations in multiple modules for MSSDG and TTPA.

Result: Validated on six datasets and a new real-world driving dataset, showing effectiveness in simultaneous MSSDG and TTPA.

Conclusion: The proposed GAP framework successfully bridges generalization and personalization, with potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising global car accident statistics necessitate automated, efficient accident detection systems to enhance transport safety and traffic control.

Method: The framework combines GANs for data synthesis and CNNs for training. Video frames are collected from YouTube, preprocessed (resizing, enhancement, normalization), and tested with CNN, FTCNN, and VIT models.

Result: FTCNN and VIT achieved 94-95% accuracy in accident detection, outperforming CNN (88%). The framework shows promise for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for traffic safety and smart city applications, laying groundwork for future intelligent surveillance and emergency systems.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for

TL;DR: A GAN-based pipeline generates realistic traffic trajectories from BEV videos, achieving fast training and inference while aligning with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions, prompting the use of GANs for better accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos to train a GAN, extracts trajectories via object detection and matching, and compares with diffusion models.

Result: Achieves realistic trajectories with 100 GPU hours training and <20ms inference, aligning with Waymo dataset metrics.

Conclusion: GANs are effective for generating accurate, fast traffic trajectories, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCoOp is a federated OOD-aware framework for vision-language models, improving robustness and performance in OOD shifts by using ID and OOD prompts with bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning (FPL) methods struggle with the trade-off between performance and robustness in OOD shifts, exacerbated by data heterogeneity.

Method: FOCoOp uses ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts for class- and distribution-level separations, optimized via bi-level distributionally robust optimization and semi-unbalanced optimal transport.

Result: Experiments show FOCoOp effectively handles decentralized heterogeneous distributions and improves robustness against OOD shifts.

Conclusion: FOCoOp addresses the limitations of FPL by enhancing robustness and performance in real-world scenarios with OOD shifts.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods assume clean, high-resolution inputs, limiting their robustness to real-world degradations like noise, blur, and weather artifacts.

Method: The survey formalizes degradation-aware rendering, categorizes recent methods integrating low-level vision into neural rendering, and reviews datasets and evaluation protocols.

Result: Identifies challenges like spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization, and highlights methods enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: 3D LLV is a key direction for robust 3D content generation and scene reconstruction in real-world applications like autonomous driving and AR/VR.

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

TL;DR: A hierarchical approach fusing 3D point clouds and RGB images for dense 3D landslide displacement estimation, outperforming existing methods in coverage and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for landslide monitoring often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates, lacking comprehensive spatial coverage.

Method: Proposes a coarse-to-fine approach using patch-level matches of 3D geometry and 2D image features, refined via geometric consistency and rigid transformation.

Result: Achieves high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy (deviations of 0.15m and 0.25m), outperforming F2S3 in coverage.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring, extensible to other point clouds and tasks.

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval (FGIR) to address overfitting and retain pre-training knowledge, achieving strong performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FGIR struggles with learning discriminative representations due to overfitting in current methods, which forget pre-training knowledge.

Method: DVA uses collaborative sample and feature adaptation: Object-Perceptual Adaptation modifies inputs, and In-Context Adaptation adjusts features without altering pre-trained parameters. Discrimination Perception Transfer balances efficiency and performance.

Result: DVA performs well on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DVA effectively addresses FGIR challenges by leveraging pre-training knowledge and adapting features, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

*Heng Zhang,Zikang Wan,Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncMapV2 is an unsupervised segmentation algorithm with state-of-the-art robustness, outperforming SOTA methods under various corruptions without robust training or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human vision excels in segmentation without explicit training and remains robust under noise, while existing AI algorithms struggle. SyncMapV2 aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses self-organizing dynamical equations and random network concepts, enabling online adaptation without re-initialization.

Result: Minimal mIoU drop (0.01%) under digital corruption vs. 23.8% in SOTA; superior performance in noise, weather, and blur conditions.

Conclusion: SyncMapV2 achieves robust, adaptive segmentation online, paving the way for future adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

*Xu Zhao,Chen Zhao,Xiantao Hu,Hongliang Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MADNet, a multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network for image denoising, addressing limitations of fixed Unet architectures and uniform frequency domain treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on fixed single-input single-output Unet architectures and treat frequency domains uniformly, ignoring multi-scale representations and noise characteristics.

Method: Uses image pyramid inputs and an adaptive spatial-frequency learning unit (ASFU) with a learnable mask to separate high/low-frequency components. Includes a global feature fusion block in skip connections.

Result: Extensive experiments show MADNet outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods on synthetic and real noisy datasets.

Conclusion: MADNet effectively addresses multi-scale and frequency domain challenges in image denoising, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and limited scope of current synthetic datasets hinder scaling perception models, necessitating a more versatile and realistic solution.

Method: Developed RealDriveSim, a multi-modal synthetic dataset with fine-grained annotations for 64 classes, evaluated across various applications.

Result: Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance compared to existing synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: RealDriveSim addresses the limitations of current synthetic datasets, offering a scalable and realistic solution for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: As perception models continue to develop, the need for large-scale datasets
increases. However, data annotation remains far too expensive to effectively
scale and meet the demand. Synthetic datasets provide a solution to boost model
performance with substantially reduced costs. However, current synthetic
datasets remain limited in their scope, realism, and are designed for specific
tasks and applications. In this work, we present RealDriveSim, a realistic
multi-modal synthetic dataset for autonomous driving that not only supports
popular 2D computer vision applications but also their LiDAR counterparts,
providing fine-grained annotations for up to 64 classes. We extensively
evaluate our dataset for a wide range of applications and domains,

### [255] [Reliable Few-shot Learning under Dual Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16330)
*Ji Zhang,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DETA++ is a noise-robust few-shot learning method using contrastive relevance aggregation and memory bank for reliable task adaptation and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods struggle with in-distribution and out-of-distribution noise, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: DETA++ employs Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA), a memory bank, and Intra-class Region Swapping (IntraSwap) for noise-robust adaptation and prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments show DETA++ effectively handles noise and improves few-shot learning performance.

Conclusion: DETA++ provides a robust solution for few-shot learning in noisy environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

TL;DR: The paper applies two transparency techniques to neural networks for Writer Identification and Verification, finding pixel-wise saliency maps more effective than point-specific ones for forensic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the transparency of neural networks in Writer Identification and Verification, aiding forensic experts by revealing the network's decision-making process.

Method: Two transparency techniques are used: pixel-level saliency maps and point-specific saliency maps, evaluated with deletion and insertion score metrics.

Result: Pixel-wise saliency maps outperform point-specific ones and align well with areas forensic experts focus on.

Conclusion: Pixel-wise saliency maps are effective for supporting forensic experts in analyzing handwritten text similarities.

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the suitability of Vision Mamba for large-scale image retrieval tasks, given its linear time complexity and strong performance in computer vision.

Method: Proposes MambaHash with a stage-wise backbone using grouped Mamba operations, channel interaction attention, and adaptive feature enhancement modules.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep hashing methods on CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and IMAGENET datasets.

Conclusion: MambaHash is efficient and superior for large-scale image retrieval, with code available for further use.

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image
retrieval tasks. Source code is available

*Pallabi Dutta,Anubhab Maity,Sushmita Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) to reduce computational costs in medical image segmentation by focusing on relevant tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs' high computational demands limit their practical use in medical image analysis. The goal is to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: An adaptive prompt-guided pruning method ranks tokens by relevance, down-weights low-relevance ones, and propagates only relevant tokens for processing.

Result: The method reduces tokens by 35-55%, lowering computational costs while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables cost-effective, real-time medical image processing, making it viable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a
huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing
medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method
to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation
pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGC-Drive is the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial-ground cooperative 3D perception, addressing gaps in UAV-involved collaborative perception and providing benchmarks for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-UAV tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work lacks focus on aerial perspectives from UAVs, which offer dynamic top-down views to mitigate occlusions and monitor large-scale environments, due to the absence of high-quality datasets.

Method: The dataset includes 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images from 14 diverse driving scenarios, collected using two vehicles and one UAV equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors.

Result: AGC-Drive covers 400 scenes with fully annotated 3D bounding boxes for 13 object categories and includes 19.5% dynamic interaction events.

Conclusion: The dataset and open-source toolkit aim to advance research in aerial-ground collaborative perception, providing resources for spatiotemporal alignment, visualization, and annotation.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gestures are subtle and involuntary, making recognition challenging in affective computing.

Method: CLIP-MG uses pose-guided semantic query generation and gated multi-modal fusion to adapt CLIP for micro-gestures.

Result: Achieves 61.82% Top-1 accuracy on the iMiGUE dataset.

Conclusion: Shows potential but highlights remaining challenges in adapting vision-language models for micro-gesture recognition.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture

*Peixiang Huang,Yanyan Huang,Weiqin Zhao,Junjun He,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperPath leverages hyperbolic space and textual descriptions to model semantic hierarchies in WSIs, improving classification with geometry-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods for WSI analysis rely on Euclidean embeddings, which inadequately capture semantic hierarchies.

Method: HyperPath integrates visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, using Angular Modality Alignment Loss and Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss for alignment and coherence.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in WSI classification tasks.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings show promise for enhancing WSI analysis by better modeling semantic hierarchies.

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

Method: The framework includes six gradient-based layout attack scenarios, manipulating OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts at word and line granularities, with layout perturbation constraints (e.g., IoU >= 0.6).

Result: Line-level attacks and compound perturbations cause the most severe performance degradation. PGD-based BBox perturbations outperform random-shift baselines.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in VDU systems and validates the impact of layout budget, text modification, and adversarial transferability.

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and classification accuracy in CNNs.

Method: Modified ResNet50 with WHT in early/late layers, tested on CIFAR-100.

Result: WHT improved accuracy (74%-79%) and reduced energy use (39 kJ vs. 25,606 kJ).

Conclusion: WHT is efficient and effective for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient

Motivation: Face swapping in videos is a growing threat due to advanced real-time tools, and detecting such manipulations is critical for secure communications.

Method: The study benchmarks CNN-based models on two datasets (one newly collected) to analyze generalization across sources and swapping algorithms, focusing on occlusion-based artifacts.

Result: CNNs perform well within the same dataset but struggle to generalize across different sources and algorithms, especially with occlusion cues.

Conclusion: Specialized detection strategies are needed to robustly identify face-swapping artifacts, particularly for occlusion-based cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between generated and handcrafted 3D assets by enhancing fidelity and detail in shape and texture generation.

Method: Two-stage pipeline with a new shape foundation model (LATTICE) and PBR-based texture generation via a multi-view architecture.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in shape and texture generation, producing cleaner, smoother, and more detailed 3D assets.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D 2.5 marks significant progress in 3D asset generation, closing the quality gap with handcrafted models.

Abstract: In this report, we present Hunyuan3D 2.5, a robust suite of 3D diffusion

*Mei Qi Tang,Sean Sedwards,Chengjie Huang,Krzysztof Czarnecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC+ is a paired weather dataset for evaluating 3D object detection in snowy vs. clear conditions, minimizing domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets lack sufficient labeled data for snowy and clear weather comparisons or rely on unrealistic synthetic data.

Method: CADC+ pairs snowy sequences from CADC with clear weather sequences from the same roads and period.

Result: Snow introduces aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting as noise and a distinct domain.

Conclusion: CADC+ enables accurate evaluation of snow's impact on 3D object detection, addressing prior dataset limitations.

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

*Keyhan Najafian,Farhad Maleki,Lingling Jin,Ian Stavness*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-self-supervised learning approach, GLMask, is proposed for instance segmentation, reducing manual annotation needs and excelling in densely packed object scenarios like agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pixel-level annotation for instance segmentation is labor-intensive, especially in agriculture with dense, occluded objects.

Method: GLMask uses image-mask representation to focus on shape, texture, and pattern, minimizing color dependence. A pipeline converts semantic to instance segmentation.

Result: Achieves 98.5% mAP@50 for wheat head segmentation and 12.6% improvement on COCO dataset.

Conclusion: The method is effective for agriculture and general domains with similar data challenges.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeTriage de-identifies patient facial videos for stroke diagnosis while preserving motion cues, using a pretrained VMT model and conditional generative model for accurate motion transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and privacy challenges in AI-based stroke triage by de-identifying patient data without losing diagnostic relevance.

Method: Leverages a pretrained VMT model to transfer motion to synthetic identities and introduces a conditional generative model to adapt input space for accurate motion transfer.

Result: Synthetic videos preserve stroke-relevant facial patterns, enabling reliable AI triage while ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: SafeTriage offers a secure, ethical solution for data sharing and AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed spatially aware metrics for uncertainty evaluation in segmentation, improving alignment with clinical factors and discrimination of uncertainty patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty metrics ignore spatial context and anatomical structure, leading to identical scores for distinct patterns.

Method: Three spatially aware metrics incorporating structural and boundary information, validated on prostate zonal segmentation data.

Result: Improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Conclusion: Spatially aware metrics enhance uncertainty evaluation in medical segmentation by considering structural context.

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

TL;DR: MetaQAP is a no-reference IQA model using quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of subjective human perception and complex real-world image distortions in IQA.

Method: Pre-training CNNs on quality-aware data, using a quality-aware loss function, and integrating a meta-learner for ensemble predictions.

Result: Achieved high PLCC/SROCC scores (e.g., 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD) and demonstrated generalizability in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: MetaQAP provides a robust, generalizable framework for practical IQA, advancing the field.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

*Ruiming Chen,Junming Yang,Shiyu Xia,Xu Yang,Jing Wang,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-LG extracts multimodal generalizable knowledge from CLIP, reducing computational costs and improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of large-scale CLIP pre-training and the lack of generalizable knowledge extraction in multimodal scenarios.

Method: Uses multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract knowledge, then initializes descendant models with these components.

Result: Achieves performance gains (e.g., +3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET) with 25% parameter storage and 2.8x lower pre-training costs.

Conclusion: MM-LG is efficient and effective for diverse downstream tasks, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread
attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for
downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of
parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a
different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: The study explores how synthetic captioning strategies impact text-to-image models, finding that dense captions improve alignment but may reduce aesthetics, while randomized-length captions balance aesthetics and alignment without losing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of insights into synthetic caption design choices for text-to-image models, given the noise in web-scraped datasets.

Method: Systematically investigates different synthetic captioning strategies and their effects on model performance.

Result: Dense captions enhance text alignment but may harm aesthetics; randomized-length captions balance aesthetics and alignment while preserving diversity. Caption distributions also affect output bias.

Conclusion: Caption design is critical for optimal model performance, offering practical insights for better training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing striped structures in adversarial patches improves effectiveness in attacking stereo depth estimation systems, including real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor performance of naively repeated textures in physical-world adversarial attacks on stereo depth estimation, aiming to enhance practical utility for security testing.

Method: Developed a novel attack by optimizing striped structures and textures, tested on state-of-the-art methods (RAFT-Stereo, STTR) and commercial RGB-D cameras.

Result: The optimized patches successfully attacked stereo depth estimation systems, including real-world conditions with Intel RealSense cameras.

Conclusion: Striped structures significantly enhance adversarial patch effectiveness, proving practical relevance for security assessments of stereo systems.

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaVi introduces efficient vision-language fusion in LVLMs via internal feature modulation, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs suffer from inefficient visual-language integration, disrupting model structure or increasing computational burden.

Method: LaVi uses lightweight adaptive transformations to inject vision-conditioned deltas into LLM layer normalization, modulating linguistic states without long-context expansion.

Result: LaVi achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmarks, reducing FLOPs by 94%, speeding up inference 3.1x, and halving memory usage.

Conclusion: LaVi is a scalable, efficient solution for real-time multimodal reasoning, outperforming existing methods like LLaVA-OV-7B.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: A framework leveraging language-driven common sense priors improves video action recognition in cluttered, occluded scenes by combining visual and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize rich common sense priors in language models for understanding scenes, objects, and interactions.

Method: Proposes a framework with: (1) video context summary, (2) description generation with reasoning, and (3) multi-modal recognition.

Result: Effective performance demonstrated on Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating language-driven common sense enhances video action recognition in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD models lack exploration of performance under limited labeled samples and known categories, prompting the need for FSGCD.

Method: A decision boundary enhancement framework is introduced, featuring pre-training and a two-stage retrieval-guided optimization strategy to refine boundaries for known and unknown categories.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing methods on six public GCD benchmarks in the FSGCD setting.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in GCD tasks, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

*Mingrui Zhu,Xiru Chen,Xin Wei,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeSG introduces textual semantics for infrared and visible image fusion, improving downstream task performance via mask and text semantic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided IVF lacks effective integration of textual semantic information, limiting its utility.

Method: TeSG uses a Semantic Information Generator (SIG), Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA), and Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) to integrate mask and text semantics.

Result: TeSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in downstream tasks like detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: TeSG effectively leverages textual semantics for superior IVF performance, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Superior inpainting performance on real-world HSI datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 3DeepRep effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging multi-directional low-rank structures, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Liu Zongzhen,Luo Hui,Wang Zhixing,Wei Yuxing,Zuo Haorui,Zhang Jianlin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDAF is a unified framework for weakly aligned UAV object detection, addressing semantic inconsistency and modality conflict through offset-guided alignment and dynamic fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robustness in UAV object detection by tackling spatial misalignment and modality conflict in RGB-IR fusion.

Method: Proposes CoDAF with OSA for semantic alignment using deformable convolution and DAFM for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 78.6% mAP on DroneVehicle dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CoDAF effectively integrates alignment and fusion, enhancing UAV object detection performance.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF
achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

TL;DR: UAV-IP improves V-IP by integrating uncertainty quantification, boosting AUC by 3.2% and providing 20% more concise explanations without losing informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V-IP methods ignore instance-level uncertainties in query-answer generation, which can undermine trust and reliability in AI decision-support systems for medical imaging.

Method: The paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a framework that quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties during the V-IP process.

Result: UAV-IP achieves an average AUC improvement of 3.2% and generates 20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP across four medical datasets.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware reasoning enhances interpretable-by-design models, making them more robust and reliable for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module to detect diffusion-generated images by focusing on shared noise patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance for unseen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generalizing forgery detection to unseen diffusion models by leveraging shared noise patterns in generated images.

Method: Proposes NASA-Swin, integrating the NASA module into Swin Transformer, using cross-modality fusion (RGB and noise images) and a channel mask strategy.

Result: Demonstrates superior detection performance, especially for unseen diffusion models.

Conclusion: The NASA-Swin architecture effectively detects diffusion-generated images, even those from untrained models, advancing information security.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

*Qi-Ying Sun,Wan-Lei Zhao,Yi-Bo Miao,Chong-Wah Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical method for instance-level region discovery using self-supervised ViT features, addressing challenges like object embedding and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unknown object categories and lack effective instance-level feature representation.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of feature subsets from self-supervised ViT to model instance regions at different semantic scales.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three instance search benchmarks.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach provides a comprehensive representation for latent instances, effective for known and unknown object categories.

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INRFuse uses Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to fuse infrared and visible light images, preserving thermal and texture details without needing a training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of infrared and visible light images for richer, more informative fused images.

Method: Uses INR to parameterize a continuous function via neural networks, fusing features adaptively with multi-layer perceptrons and optimizing via multiple loss functions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality and metrics, producing clear, detailed, and resolution-independent fused images.

Conclusion: INRFuse is effective for multimodal image fusion, offering superior results without training data.

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

TL;DR: PQCAD-DM combines Progressive Quantization and Calibration-Assisted Distillation to compress diffusion models, improving efficiency without sacrificing generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally intensive and suffer from error accumulation, making compression challenging.

Method: PQCAD-DM uses two-stage quantization (PQ) and calibration-assisted distillation (CAD) to reduce computational load while maintaining performance.

Result: PQCAD-DM halves inference time and outperforms fixed-bit quantization methods, balancing efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: PQCAD-DM is a robust solution for compressing diffusion models, validated by superior performance across datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain tumor segmentation lacks multimodal datasets combining images and text, limiting exploration of text-image fusion methods.

Method: A novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric segmentation, tested with various fusion strategies and text formulations.

Result: Significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, demonstrating effective multimodal integration.

Conclusion: The TextBraTS dataset and proposed framework advance multimodal brain tumor analysis, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Real-World Image Super-Resolution struggle with understanding degraded content, leading to low-fidelity results.

Method: Proposes VLCoT framework inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT) in LLMs, integrating vision and language reasoning, and introduces GRPO with four reward functions for better generalization.

Result: RealSR-R1 generates realistic details and accurately understands image content, especially in semantically rich or severely degraded scenes.

Conclusion: The VLCoT-GRPO framework effectively enhances Real-World Image Super-Resolution by improving detail restoration and realism.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

*Riccardo Corvi,Davide Cozzolino,Ekta Prashnani,Shalini De Mello,Koki Nagano,Luisa Verdoliva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method improves AI-generated video detection by focusing on low-level artifacts and using wavelet-based augmentation, enhancing generalization without large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video forensic detectors lack generalization, limiting real-world applicability. The goal is to focus on intrinsic low-level artifacts rather than high-level flaws.

Method: Study generative architectures for discriminative features, introduce wavelet-based augmentation to highlight forensic cues, and train a detector on single-model data.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, even on recent models like NOVA and FLUX.

Conclusion: The approach improves detector generalizability without complex algorithms or extensive datasets, offering practical real-world utility.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Co-VisiON benchmark to evaluate co-visibility reasoning in sparse image sets, revealing a gap between human and model performance. A novel multi-view baseline, Covis, is proposed to improve results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current vision models match human-level co-visibility reasoning, especially in sparse conditions, and to advance high-level reasoning in vision models.

Method: The Co-VisiON benchmark evaluates co-visibility on sparse image sets across 1000+ indoor scenarios. A multi-view baseline, Covis, is proposed, inspired by human cognition.

Result: Proprietary vision-language models outperform purely vision-based approaches, but all lag behind humans. Covis achieves top performance among vision models.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for high-level reasoning in vision models. Covis narrows the gap to proprietary models, encouraging further advancements in sparse environments.

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a unified LVLM integrating segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation in an end-to-end framework, outperforming disjointed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs treat visual understanding and editing separately, relying on multiple disjointed models, creating inefficiencies.

Method: FOCUS uses a dual-branch visual encoder, MoVQGAN-based tokenizer, and a progressive multi-stage training pipeline with segmentation masks as spatial prompts.

Result: FOCUS excels in multimodal understanding, referring segmentation, and controllable image generation.

Conclusion: FOCUS effectively bridges segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis, achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing deepfake detection methods, such as poor generalization and complex architectures, Loupe aims for joint detection and localization with improved robustness.

Method: Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and segmentation module with conditional queries, along with a pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation mechanism.

Result: Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.846 score) on the DDL dataset, winning the IJCAI 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The patch-level fusion and conditional query design in Loupe effectively improve classification accuracy and spatial localization across diverse forgery patterns.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for ball detection in humanoid soccer robots reduces reliance on manual annotations by using pseudo-labels and pretext tasks, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised ball detection methods require costly manual annotations, prompting the need for a more efficient, self-supervised approach.

Method: The framework uses a pretrained model for pseudo-labels, self-supervised pretext tasks (colorization, edge detection, triplet loss), and MAML for rapid adaptation.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, with faster convergence, validated on a new 10,000-image dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework enhances ball detection performance efficiently, with potential for broader application in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks struggle with unstructured environments and lack adaptability for diverse robot types, limiting autonomous navigation applications.

Method: Combines natural language prompts with human-operator assistance, using zero-shot learning to avoid extensive data collection or retraining.

Result: Outperforms GA-NAV and Off-seg, validated on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets, and deployed on multiple robot platforms.

Conclusion: AnyTraverse offers a vehicle-agnostic, adaptable solution balancing automation with targeted human supervision.

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

Method: The authors introduce an unbiased projection model for circular patterns and incorporate centroid uncertainty. They model boundary points as a Markov random field and propagate shape distribution to centroid uncertainty using the Green theorem.

Result: The proposed framework achieves significant improvements in calibration accuracy and robustness compared to checkerboard methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more accurate and robust solution for camera calibration using circular patterns, with guidelines for optimal calibration performance.

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

### [298] [Controllable and Expressive One-Shot Video Head Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16852)
*Chaonan Ji,Jinwei Qi,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang,Liefeng Bo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for video head swapping that preserves identity and allows expression editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack holistic head preservation and post-swap expression control.

Method: Uses identity-preserving context fusion and expression-aware landmark retargeting within a latent diffusion paradigm.

Result: Achieves seamless background integration and superior expression transfer for real/virtual characters.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations of current head-swapping techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition
controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a
human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the
original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak
head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing
face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

*Jun Fu,Bin Tian,Haonan Chen,Shi Meng,Tingting Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer-based end-to-end framework for autonomous parking learns from expert demonstrations, achieving high success rates and precision in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with environmental uncertainties, while human drivers park intuitively. This paper aims to replicate human-like adaptability in autonomous parking.

Method: The proposed framework uses surround-view camera images, goal-point representations, ego motion, and pedestrian trajectories as inputs. It employs a cross-attention module for BEV feature integration and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor for safety.

Result: The model achieves a 96.57% success rate in CARLA simulations, with positional and orientation errors of 0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates high effectiveness, with key modules like pedestrian prediction and goal-point attention fusion proving crucial. The code and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

*Fabian Gröger,Shuo Wen,Huyen Le,Maria Brbić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to build multimodal models with limited paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal models, achieving high performance with minimal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models require vast paired data, which is costly or unavailable in many domains. This work explores alignment with limited data.

Method: Introduces STRUCTURE, a regularization technique preserving latent space geometry, and aligns layers with highest representational similarity across modalities.

Result: Achieves significant improvements (51.6% in classification, 91.8% in retrieval) across 24 benchmarks with minimal data.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for resource-constrained domains, offering a scalable solution for limited-sample multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

*Annika Thomas,Robaire Galliath,Aleksander Garbuz,Luke Anger,Cormac O'Neill,Trevor Johst,Dami Thomas,George Lordos,Jonathan P. How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LunarLoc is a global localization method for lunar surface operations, using instance segmentation and graph-based terrain alignment to achieve drift-free, sub-cm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous lunar operations lack Earth-based navigation like GPS, requiring precise pose estimation for tasks like regolith transport. Existing methods like VIO suffer from drift over long traverses.

Method: LunarLoc uses instance segmentation to extract boulder landmarks from stereo imagery, constructs a terrain graph, and aligns it with a reference map using graph-theoretic data association.

Result: Achieves sub-cm accuracy in multi-session global localization, outperforming current lunar localization methods.

Conclusion: LunarLoc provides accurate, drift-free localization for lunar missions, with datasets released to foster further development.

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a
previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables
accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.
LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization
experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global
localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global
localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback
module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

### [302] [LAION-C: An Out-of-Distribution Benchmark for Web-Scale Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16950)
*Fanfei Li,Thomas Klein,Wieland Brendel,Robert Geirhos,Roland S. Zimmermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAION-C is introduced as a new benchmark for OOD robustness, addressing limitations of older benchmarks like ImageNet-C by using novel distortions not found in web-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like ImageNet-C are no longer suitable for evaluating OOD robustness due to their corruptions being common in modern web-scale datasets, leading to unclear progress in model generalization.

Method: LAION-C is proposed with six novel distortion types designed to be OOD for web-scale datasets. State-of-the-art models, including MLLMs like Gemini and GPT-4o, are evaluated on LAION-C, and human robustness data is collected via psychophysical experiments.

Result: LAION-C poses significant challenges to contemporary models, revealing a paradigm shift where top models now match or exceed human performance in OOD generalization.

Conclusion: LAION-C provides a more accurate benchmark for OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets, highlighting advancements in model generalization and the need for updated evaluation standards.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

*Wenyang Luo,Haina Qin,Zewen Chen,Libin Wang,Dandan Zheng,Yuming Li,Yufan Liu,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defusion is an all-in-one image restoration framework using visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion, outperforming task-specific models for mixed or unknown degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models require distinct approaches for each degradation type, limiting generalization in real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations.

Method: Defusion constructs explicit visual instructions aligned with degradation patterns, guiding a diffusion-based model to denoise degradation effects directly in the degradation space.

Result: Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.

Conclusion: Defusion offers a generalized, stable, and high-quality solution for image restoration, addressing limitations of task-specific models.

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS) to generate rigorous medical chain-of-thought (CoT) data, improving reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating reasoning paths in medical MLLMs, limiting their diagnostic capabilities.

Method: MICS uses mentor models to initialize reasoning paths, prompts intern models to extend them, and selects optimal paths via MICS-Score. The resulting CoT data trains Chiron-o1, a medical MLLM.

Result: Chiron-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MICS enhances medical MLLMs' reasoning, validated by Chiron-o1's superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResFlow is a novel image restoration framework using deterministic paths via continuous normalizing flows, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models treat degradation as stochastic, leading to inefficiency and complexity.

Method: ResFlow models degradation as a deterministic path with entropy-preserving flow paths and learns by matching velocity fields.

Result: ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results and completes restoration in fewer than four steps.

Conclusion: ResFlow offers a practical, efficient solution for image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded
low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: Prmpt2Adpt is a lightweight, zero-shot UDA framework using prompt-based feature alignment and a teacher-student model for efficient adaptation in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing UDA methods, which rely on large models and full source data, for real-world applications like drones.

Method: Uses a distilled CLIP model as a frozen backbone, aligns source features to target via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN), and employs a teacher-student paradigm for adaptation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance, 7x faster adaptation, and 5x faster inference on the MDS-A dataset with few source images.

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt is a practical, scalable solution for real-time domain adaptation in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

TL;DR: MEXA is a training-free framework for multimodal reasoning that dynamically selects and aggregates expert models based on input modality and task demands, improving performance across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity makes unified multimodal reasoning challenging, requiring a flexible and scalable solution.

Method: MEXA selects expert models per modality-task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning, and aggregates outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM).

Result: MEXA outperforms baselines in diverse benchmarks (Video, Audio, 3D, Medical QA), demonstrating broad applicability.

Conclusion: MEXA's modular, expert-driven approach enables effective and transparent multimodal reasoning without additional training.

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative approach for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of single-vehicle perception by leveraging shared information. It augments an existing dataset with dense annotations and benchmarks varying prediction ranges, proposing a baseline model that outperforms single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-vehicle perception is limited by occlusion, sensor range, and viewpoints. Collaborative perception can overcome these by exchanging complementary information, improving completeness and accuracy.

Method: The paper augments an existing dataset with dense semantic voxel annotations using CARLA. It benchmarks varying prediction ranges and proposes a baseline model with inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention aggregation.

Result: The baseline model consistently outperforms single-agent models, with greater improvements as the prediction range expands.

Conclusion: Collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction enhances perception capabilities, with the proposed model showing significant gains over single-agent approaches, especially for larger prediction ranges.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

### [310] [Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Real-World Degradation Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17027)
*Yiyang Tie,Hong Zhu,Yunyun Luo,Jing Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel TripleGAN framework is proposed to address challenges in modeling real-world degradation patterns for super-resolution (SR) reconstruction, outperforming existing methods on RealSR and DRealSR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture diverse degradation patterns (blur, noise, color shifts) in real-world low-resolution (LR) images, and synthetic datasets fail to bridge the degradation domain gap.

Method: The TripleGAN framework includes three GANs: FirstGAN narrows the blur domain gap, SecondGAN learns additional degradations, and ThirdGAN reconstructs LR images from pseudo-real data.

Result: The method achieves superior quantitative metrics and sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing on RealSR and DRealSR datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns, enabling high-quality SR reconstruction from real-world LR inputs.

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

*Lorenzo Tausani,Paolo Muratore,Morgan B. Talbot,Giacomo Amerio,Gabriel Kreiman,Davide Zoccolan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SnS is a framework to study visual unit invariance and adversarial sensitivity in CNNs, revealing transformations that preserve or suppress unit responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual units generalize by characterizing their invariance landscapes and adversarial vulnerabilities.

Method: Introduces Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), a gradient-free, model-agnostic framework for bi-objective optimization of image perturbations.

Result: SnS identified image variations preserving unit responses better than affine transformations, with differences based on representation levels. Robust CNNs produced more human-recognizable invariant images.

Conclusion: SnS effectively probes invariance and adversarial sensitivity, highlighting robust CNNs as better models of the visual system.

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

### [312] [Relaxed syntax modeling in Transformers for future-proof license plate recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17051)
*Florent Meyer,Laurent Guichard,Denis Coquenet,Guillaume Gravier,Yann Soullard,Bertrand Coüasnon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SaLT, a Syntax-Less Transformer, to address the performance drop of Transformer-based networks in license plate recognition due to syntax shifts in new plates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers perform poorly on new license plates with unseen syntax, making them unreliable for production. The goal is to create a syntax-agnostic model.

Method: The authors analyze Transformer flaws, propose architectural changes, and integrate them into SaLT for syntax-agnostic modeling.

Result: SaLT maintains high accuracy on past syntax and nearly matches performance on future plates, proving robust in experiments.

Conclusion: SaLT offers a viable solution for syntax-agnostic license plate recognition, addressing Transformer limitations in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

*Wang Zhao,Yan-Pei Cao,Jiale Xu,Yuejiang Dong,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Assembler is a scalable framework for 3D part assembly using diffusion models and a novel shape-centric representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches in handling diverse, real-world objects with varying part counts and structures.

Method: Uses diffusion models for generative part assembly, a sparse anchor point cloud representation, and a large-scale dataset of 320K part-object assemblies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and demonstrates high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects.

Conclusion: Assembler enables scalable and generalizable 3D part assembly, with potential for interactive and compositional design.

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we
further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates
high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for
interactive and compositional design. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAA-CAL, a novel learning system combining knowledge acquisition and accumulation with active learning to improve multi-label driving scene identification, outperforming baselines and SOTA models with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing autonomous vehicles' contextual awareness by addressing challenges in multi-label classification for driving scenes, such as dataset imbalance and task learning balance.

Method: KAA acquires knowledge from single-label datasets via monotask learning, while CAL bridges the knowledge gap caused by distribution discrepancies.

Result: KAA-CAL achieves a 56.1% performance boost over the baseline, with KAA contributing 31.3% and CAL 24.8%. It also outperforms SOTA models using 85% less data.

Conclusion: KAA-CAL effectively addresses multi-label classification challenges, offering significant performance gains and efficiency, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of precise object pose tracking without depth input, enabling applications in robotics, AR, and computer vision.

Method: Uses a novel binary search strategy with render-and-compare for depth inference, integrates XMem for 2D tracking, Kalman filter, and a state machine for stability. Includes a scale recovery module for CAD models.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance on benchmarks, suitable for practical applications.

Conclusion: RGBTrack is a promising solution for depth-free 6D pose tracking, with potential in robotics, AR, and computer vision.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation
and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for
depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building
on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy
combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and
generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern
generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves
competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical
solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,
and computer vision.

*Md Sakibur Sajal,Marc Dandin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel watermarking technique using pgSPAD imagers is proposed, leveraging DSNU for source identification and tamper detection with controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore watermarking in SPAD imagers, which haven't been investigated before, using manufacturing variations (DSNU) for security.

Method: Utilized DSNU of three 64x64 pgSPAD imager chips in a 0.35μm CMOS process to analyze watermarks for standard test images.

Result: Achieved source identification and tamper detection with dynamic watermarks, balancing sensitivity and robustness.

Conclusion: pgSPAD imagers are viable for watermarking, offering a new security feature with adaptable performance.

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach is proposed to improve performance with limited labeled data by leveraging complementary multi-modal information and contrastive mutual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inadequacy of semi-supervised learning in complex medical image tasks and the challenge of effectively utilizing unlabeled data in multi-modal fusion methods.

Method: Multi-stage multi-modal fusion and enhancement strategy to reduce feature discrepancies and enhance feature sharing, along with contrastive mutual learning for prediction consistency.

Result: Superior performance and robustness demonstrated on two multi-modal datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows valuable potential for complex medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in
medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex
backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly
improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

### [318] [On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137)
*Zhuonan Liang,Dongnan Liu,Jianan Fan,Yaxuan Song,Qiang Qu,Yu Yao,Peng Fu,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for conditional feature alignment to address domain adaptation challenges in object counting, showing improved performance over unconditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard domain adaptation fails in object counting due to density shifts, which are task-relevant. The paper aims to address this by aligning features conditionally.

Method: The framework formalizes conditional divergence by partitioning domains into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and derives a joint error bound. It introduces a practical adaptation strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive counting.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show the method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, validating the theoretical benefits of conditional alignment.

Conclusion: Conditional feature alignment improves cross-domain generalization for counting by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts.

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Rajatsubhra Chakraborty,Avijit Dasgupta,Sandeep Chaurasia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a text-based approach using LLMs for soccer action spotting, replacing video-centric methods, and demonstrates its effectiveness on the SoccerNet Echoes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video-based action spotting is complex and computationally expensive. The paper suggests leveraging expert commentary's rich descriptions and contextual cues for a lightweight, scalable alternative.

Method: Uses three LLMs as judges (outcome, excitement, tactics) to evaluate timestamped commentary from SoccerNet Echoes, identifying actions like goals and substitutions.

Result: The language-centric approach effectively detects key match events, offering a lightweight, training-free alternative to video-based methods.

Conclusion: Text-based action spotting using LLMs is a viable, efficient alternative to traditional video-centric approaches.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

*Qing Xu,Yuxiang Luo,Wenting Duan,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Seg++ is a framework for medical image segmentation that jointly performs semantic and instance segmentation, improving performance by leveraging interdependencies between tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat segmentation tasks in isolation, ignoring interdependencies, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Uses a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) for spatial constraints and a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) for joint semantic and instance segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation on CT and histopathology datasets.

Conclusion: Co-Seg++ enhances medical image understanding by integrating semantic and instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking objects over time improves detection performance and aids downstream tasks like behavior classification and abundance estimation.

Method: Processes outputs from object detectors to track objects, supports monoscopic/stereoscopic cameras, and generates consensus detections from detector ensembles.

Result: A functional tracker (yasmot) that enhances object detection in image time series.

Conclusion: yasmot offers a versatile solution for object tracking, improving detection and supporting various applications.

Abstract: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that
can analyze images and extract locations and class labels for occurrences of
objects. For image time series (i.e., video or sequences of stills), tracking
objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object
detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including
classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we
present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the
output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either
monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes
functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object
detectors.

TL;DR: Proposes facial landmark box plots for dataset analysis and compares two facial landmark feature sets, finding neural networks outperform random forests in emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving emotion recognition from facial images by addressing the lack of thorough dataset analysis and visualizing facial landmarks.

Method: Uses facial landmark box plots for outlier detection and compares absolute positions vs. displacements of landmarks. Tests neural networks and random forest classifiers.

Result: Neural networks perform better than random forests in emotion recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Facial landmark box plots aid dataset analysis, and neural networks are superior for emotion recognition from facial landmarks.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan-GameCraft is a framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in games, addressing limitations in dynamics, generality, and efficiency. It unifies inputs into a shared camera space, uses hybrid history-conditioned training, and employs model distillation for real-time deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video generation in games lack dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, limiting gameplay video creation.

Method: The framework unifies keyboard/mouse inputs into a shared camera space, uses hybrid history-conditioned training, and applies model distillation for efficiency.

Result: Trained on a large dataset of gameplay recordings, Hunyuan-GameCraft outperforms existing models in realism and playability.

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft advances interactive game video generation with improved realism, control, and real-time performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFork, a Y-shaped architecture, balances shared learning and task specialization for unified image understanding and generation, outperforming fully shared Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The divergent modality alignment patterns in understanding and generation tasks create conflicts in shared Transformer backbones, leading to performance compromises.

Method: Analyzed modality alignment behaviors of expert and unified models, then designed UniFork with shared shallow layers and task-specific deeper branches.

Result: UniFork outperforms fully shared Transformer architectures and matches or exceeds task-specific models.

Conclusion: UniFork effectively resolves the conflict in shared backbones, offering a superior design for unified image understanding and generation.

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated objects are common but challenging to model accurately in 3D reconstruction.

Method: Uses a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation with learnable attributes and physics-based constraints for motion consistency.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 10x in Chamfer Distance for movable parts.

Conclusion: Part$^{2}$GS advances articulated object modeling with high-fidelity and physically consistent results.

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable
parts.

TL;DR: InfGen is a unified model for long-term traffic simulation, combining closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior models focus on short-term closed-loop motion simulation, which is insufficient for long-term scenarios where agents enter and exit dynamically.

Method: InfGen uses a next-token prediction model to interleave closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation, switching modes automatically.

Result: InfGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in short-term (9s) simulation and significantly outperforms others in long-term (30s) simulation.

Conclusion: InfGen enables stable long-term traffic simulation, with code and model to be released.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a
scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the
scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified
next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion
simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between
closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in
short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other
methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

*Zeyuan Yang,Xueyang Yu,Delin Chen,Maohao Shen,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage enhances VLMs by using latent visual tokens for multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with tasks requiring visual imagination due to text-only decoding. Current methods using image-generation pre-training hinder reasoning.

Method: Mirage introduces latent visual tokens alongside text, supervised via distillation and reinforcement learning, avoiding pixel-level images.

Result: Mirage improves multimodal reasoning on benchmarks without generating explicit images.

Conclusion: Mirage offers a novel approach for VLMs to reason visually without explicit image generation, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

*Jisu Nam,Soowon Son,Dahyun Chung,Jiyoung Kim,Siyoon Jin,Junhwa Hur,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffTrack is a framework for analyzing temporal correspondences in video diffusion models (DiTs), revealing key insights into their mechanisms and applications in tracking and video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how video diffusion models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames.

Method: DiffTrack constructs a dataset with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes metrics to analyze DiTs' 3D attention mechanisms.

Result: Query-key similarities in specific layers are critical for temporal matching, improving during denoising. DiffTrack achieves state-of-the-art in zero-shot tracking and enhances video generation.

Conclusion: DiffTrack provides insights into DiTs' temporal understanding, enabling further research and applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

*Zhangyang Qi,Zhixiong Zhang,Yizhou Yu,Jiaqi Wang,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLN-R1 is an end-to-end framework using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) for continuous navigation, trained with GRPO and a two-stage approach (SFT + RFT), achieving strong performance on VLN-CE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN systems are limited to discrete graphs; VLN-R1 aims to enable continuous navigation using LVLMs for better real-world applicability.

Method: Uses LVLMs to translate egocentric video into actions, with GRPO-based training, Long-Short Memory Sampling, and a two-stage approach (SFT + RFT with TDR).

Result: VLN-R1 performs well on VLN-CE, showing LVLMs can enhance embodied navigation and task reasoning.

Conclusion: LVLMs can effectively drive continuous navigation with data-efficient, reward-driven training, as demonstrated by VLN-R1.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores optimization in large language models (LLMs) using information geometry, highlighting natural gradient descent and its insights into phenomena like sharp minima and scaling laws. It also speculates on quantum analogies for efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve optimization in LLMs by leveraging the non-Euclidean structure of high-dimensional parameter spaces through information geometry.

Method: Uses the Fisher information metric and natural gradient descent to analyze LLM training dynamics, with additional speculation on quantum analogies like the Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information.

Result: Provides a geometric perspective on LLM optimization, clarifying phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and scaling laws.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware approaches enhance understanding of LLM training, and quantum-inspired methods may offer efficient optimization in future systems.

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient

### [332] [MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15841)
*Zijian Zhou,Ao Qu,Zhaoxuan Wu,Sunghwan Kim,Alok Prakash,Daniela Rus,Jinhua Zhao,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM1 is a reinforcement learning framework for language agents that maintains constant memory by consolidating and discarding irrelevant information, improving efficiency and performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems suffer from unbounded memory growth and degraded performance due to full-context prompting, necessitating a scalable solution for long-horizon interactions.

Method: MEM1 uses a compact shared internal state updated at each turn, integrating prior memory with new observations while discarding irrelevant data. Training involves composing datasets into complex task sequences.

Result: MEM1-7B outperforms Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct by 3.5x in performance and reduces memory usage by 3.7x, generalizing beyond training horizons.

Conclusion: MEM1 demonstrates the effectiveness of reasoning-driven memory consolidation for scalable, efficient long-horizon language agents.

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLaME, a benchmarking suite to evaluate Language Models (LMs) on specialized finance NLP tasks, addressing gaps in existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks inadequately assess LMs for finance-specific NLP tasks, leading to underestimated performance.

Method: The study evaluates 23 foundation LMs and 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs across 20 core finance NLP tasks using the FLaME suite.

Result: The paper provides empirical evidence of LMs' potential for finance NLP tasks, with open-sourced framework, data, and results.

Conclusion: FLaME demonstrates LMs' capabilities in finance NLP, correcting prior underestimations and offering a comprehensive evaluation tool.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly
specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess
due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which
have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on
common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for
these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for
Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to
comprehensively study LMs against 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs, with an empirical
study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source
our framework software along with all data and results.

*Yifan Hu,Frank Liang,Dachuan Zhao,Jonathan Geuter,Varshini Reddy,Craig W. Schmidt,Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies to improve BPE for unsegmented languages like Chinese, showing better segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE struggles with unsegmented languages due to its frequency-driven approach, ignoring linguistic boundaries.

Method: Two strategies: (1) using pointwise mutual info and entropy to find coherent spans, (2) leveraging GPT-2's predictive entropy for boundary detection.

Result: Improved precision, recall, and F1 score on the PKU dataset compared to standard BPE.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided pre-tokenization aligns better with linguistic units and enhances tokenization quality, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

*Sam Silver,Jimin Sun,Ivan Zhang,Sara Hooker,Eddie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show intrinsic self-correction abilities in reasoning tasks, even without fine-tuning for long Chain of Thought, suggesting these traits are inherent and amplified in recent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the self-correction capabilities of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, especially under minor variations and sampling-induced errors.

Method: Experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations in their Chain of Thought reasoning.

Result: Robust intrinsic self-correction behavior observed across models and datasets, from subtle to explicit corrections.

Conclusion: LLMs possess stronger intrinsic self-correction capabilities than previously recognized, indicating recent advancements amplify existing traits.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tibbe-AG, a pipeline to evaluate LLMs on culturally grounded Islamic medical texts, showing retrieval and self-critique improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in modern AI systems' utilization of Islamic medical texts and validate culturally sensitive medical guidance.

Method: Proposes Tibbe-AG, a pipeline testing three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and self-critique filter, assessed by an agentic judge.

Result: Retrieval boosts factual accuracy by 13%, and the agentic prompt adds 10% more improvement through deeper insights and safety.

Conclusion: Combining classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical QA.

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses gaps in evaluating and improving unbiased summaries in political perspective summarization using LLMs, proposing reliable metrics and effective methods like reranking and preference tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for perspective summarization lack reliable metrics, and current summarization methods are underdeveloped.

Method: The study identifies reliable metrics using human annotations, compares traditional and language model-based metrics, and tests reranking and preference tuning methods.

Result: Language model-based metrics outperform traditional ones, and reranking and preference tuning methods significantly improve summarization performance.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to better evaluation and development of perspective summarization methods, emphasizing the effectiveness of advanced LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

Motivation: Address the lack of robust NLP resources for Vietnamese, a widely spoken but under-resourced language.

Method: Created VSMRC using Vietnamese Wikipedia, with human-verified synthetic QA pairs and text segmentation documents.

Result: mBERT achieved 88.01% accuracy on MRC and 63.15% F1 on text segmentation, outperforming monolingual models.

Conclusion: Multilingual models like mBERT excel in Vietnamese NLP tasks, with potential applications for other under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Vietnamese, the 20th most spoken language with over 102 million native

as text segmentation and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address this
gap, we present VSMRC, the Vietnamese Text Segmentation and Multiple-Choice
Reading Comprehension Dataset. Sourced from Vietnamese Wikipedia, our dataset
includes 15,942 documents for text segmentation and 16,347 synthetic
multiple-choice question-answer pairs generated with human quality assurance,

TL;DR: A multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline (DE-detect) is proposed to detect AI-generated music by combining transcribed sung lyrics and speech features, outperforming existing methods in robustness and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated music poses challenges for detection, as current audio or lyrics-based methods have limitations like poor generalization and reliance on clean lyrics.

Method: A multimodal approach using transcribed sung lyrics and speech features from audio, enhancing robustness and practicality.

Result: DE-detect outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors and is more robust to audio perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ProxyReward is a new RL-based framework for Open-LTG tasks, improving performance by 20% and surpassing GPT-4-Turbo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of exploration in Open-LTG tasks and the absence of gold standard reference data.

Method: Introduces ProxyReward, a dataset and reward signal method, using simple prompts for dataset generation and targeted evaluation.

Result: ProxyReward outperforms GPT-4-Turbo and LLM-as-a-Judge, improving Open-LTG performance by 20%.

Conclusion: ProxyReward effectively enhances LLMs' ability to handle complex open-ended questions.

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation of design choices in multi-stage LM training.

Method: Train over 100 LMs (1B and 4B parameters) and evaluate upstream and downstream capabilities.

Result: Key findings include diminishing returns from excessive training and the critical role of continued pre-training.

Conclusion: EvoLM provides transparent analysis and releases all models and pipelines to support open research.

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

Built upon LLaMA 3, the framework integrates a dense retrieval module with

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynScaling improves LLM performance via integrated parallel-sequential sampling and dynamic budget allocation, outperforming baselines without external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of inference-time scaling, such as reliance on external verifiers and lack of optimization for computational constraints.

Method: Proposes DynScaling with two innovations: integrated parallel-sequential sampling and bandit-based dynamic budget allocation.

Result: Outperforms existing verifier-free baselines in task performance and computational cost.

Conclusion: DynScaling effectively enhances LLM performance under practical constraints without external verifiers.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing methods, provides transparency, and identifies areas for future improvement, such as detecting implicit bias and sarcasm.

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

### [345] [Knee-Deep in C-RASP: A Transformer Depth Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16055)
*Andy Yang,Michaël Cadilhac,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower ones, proven theoretically and supported empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally establish the capabilities gained with increased transformer depth.

Method: Theoretical proof using transformers with fixed precision (except in attention) and equivalence to C-RASP, followed by empirical study.

Result: Deeper transformers are more expressive, and theory predicts depth requirements for generalization.

Conclusion: Depth enhances transformer expressiveness, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

*Duc Hieu Ho,Chenglin Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 10 LLMs and introduces a self-critique-guided prompting strategy to improve honesty and helpfulness in outputs, showing consistent improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ensuring LLMs produce consistently honest and helpful outputs without additional training.

Method: Proposes self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting, involving self-critique and refinement steps.

Result: Improves H² scores by 1.4% to 4.3%, reducing poor-quality and increasing high-quality responses.

Conclusion: Structured self-refinement is effective for scalable, training-free enhancement of LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

TL;DR: A framework for detecting cyberbullying in Hinglish text using MURIL architecture outperforms existing models, achieving high accuracy across six datasets, with explainability features and insights for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish) communication on digital platforms challenges existing monolingual cyberbullying detection systems, necessitating a tailored solution.

Method: The paper employs the MURIL architecture for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text, incorporating explainability features like attribution analysis and cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Techniques include selective layer freezing, classification head design, and specialized preprocessing.

Result: The MURIL-based approach outperforms RoBERTa and IndicBERT, with accuracy improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points across six datasets (e.g., 86.97% on Bohra, 94.63% on Mendeley).

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness but highlights challenges like context-dependent interpretation and sarcasm detection, guiding future research in multilingual cyberbullying detection.

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinCoT introduces structured CoT prompting for financial reasoning, outperforming standard and unstructured CoT methods, improving accuracy and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work in FinNLP lacks domain-specific structured CoT prompting, relying on non-expert heuristics. FinCoT addresses this gap.

Method: Evaluates three prompting styles (standard, unstructured CoT, structured CoT) and FinCoT on CFA-style questions across ten financial domains.

Result: FinCoT boosts performance (63.2% to 80.5%) and reduces token usage eight-fold compared to structured CoT.

Conclusion: Domain-aligned structured prompts enhance performance, reduce costs, and improve interpretability of reasoning traces.

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

*Chenxi Wang,Yixuan Zhang,Lang Gao,Zixiang Xu,Zirui Song,Yanbo Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs internalize language-specific reasoning biases, as shown by their attention patterns and performance on a bilingual causal reasoning dataset (BICAUSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs internalize the habitual logical structures embedded in different languages, as suggested by linguistic relativity.

Method: Used BICAUSE, a bilingual dataset with aligned Chinese and English samples, to analyze LLMs' attention patterns and causal reasoning.

Result: LLMs show typologically aligned attention patterns, language-specific causal order preferences, and degraded performance on atypical inputs. Successful reasoning leads to semantically aligned abstractions across languages.

Conclusion: LLMs mimic and internalize reasoning biases shaped by language, empirically verified through structural analysis.

Abstract: Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human
cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure
of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

### [350] [SGIC: A Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16172)
*Guanhua Chen,Yutong Yao,Lidia S. Chao,Xuebo Liu,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGIC, a Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework, to enhance LLM calibration by using uncertainty scores for document relevance and response confidence, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods often overlook LLMs' calibration capabilities, which can leverage their in-context reasoning. The study aims to improve calibration efficacy with specific cues.

Method: SGIC uses uncertainty scores to assess document relevance and LLM response confidence, iteratively refining calibration. It also creates a self-calibration training set to optimize LLM use of uncertainty scores.

Result: The framework significantly boosts performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: SGIC effectively enhances LLM calibration and response accuracy through iterative self-guided refinement.

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

TL;DR: JETHICS is a Japanese dataset for evaluating AI ethics understanding, with 78K examples based on normative theories and commonsense morality. Evaluations show GPT-4o scores ~0.7, while the best Japanese LLM scores ~0.5, indicating significant room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the ethics understanding of AI models, particularly for Japanese language and cultural contexts.

Method: Constructed JETHICS dataset following the English ETHICS dataset's methods, including four normative theory categories and commonsense morality. Evaluated non-proprietary LLMs and GPT-4o.

Result: GPT-4o scored ~0.7, and the best Japanese LLM scored ~0.5, highlighting gaps in current models' ethics understanding.

Conclusion: Current LLMs, including GPT-4o, have substantial room for improvement in understanding ethics, especially in Japanese contexts.

Abstract: In this work, we propose JETHICS, a Japanese dataset for evaluating ethics
understanding of AI models. JETHICS contains 78K examples and is built by
following the construction methods of the existing English ETHICS dataset. It
includes four categories based normative theories and concepts from ethics and
political philosophy; and one representing commonsense morality. Our evaluation
experiments on non-proprietary large language models (LLMs) and on GPT-4o
reveal that even GPT-4o achieves only an average score of about 0.7, while the
best-performing Japanese LLM attains around 0.5, indicating a relatively large
room for improvement in current LLMs.

Motivation: To automate the summarization of detailed radiology findings into compact impressions, aiding medical professionals.

Method: Comparative analysis of pre-trained models (T5, BART, PEGASUS, ChatGPT-4, LLaMA-3-8B) and a custom Pointer Generator Network, evaluated using ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore.

Result: Identifies strengths and limitations of each model in medical text summarization.

Conclusion: Provides insights for healthcare professionals seeking automated summarization solutions.

Abstract: The findings section of a radiology report is often detailed and lengthy,
whereas the impression section is comparatively more compact and captures key
diagnostic conclusions. This research explores the use of advanced abstractive
summarization models to generate the concise impression from the findings
section of a radiology report. We have used the publicly available MIMIC-CXR
dataset. A comparative analysis is conducted on leading pre-trained and
open-source large language models, including T5-base, BART-base,
PEGASUS-x-base, ChatGPT-4, LLaMA-3-8B, and a custom Pointer Generator Network
with a coverage mechanism. To ensure a thorough assessment, multiple evaluation
metrics are employed, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and
BERTScore. By analyzing the performance of these models, this study identifies
their respective strengths and limitations in the summarization of medical
text. The findings of this paper provide helpful information for medical

TL;DR: Weakly labeled data can effectively build speech-to-text translation models for low-resource languages, matching performance of large baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of scarce high-quality annotated data for low-resource speech-to-text translation.

Method: Used bitext mining with sentence encoders to create datasets (Shrutilipi-anuvaad) for Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi, Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. Varied data quality/quantity for analysis.

Result: ST models built with weakly labeled data perform comparably to large baselines like SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Conclusion: Weakly labeled data is viable for ST systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid scoring model for automated speaking assessment (ASA) by enhancing content relevance analysis and fine-grained grammar error detection, improving overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASA systems lack comprehensive content relevance evaluation and detailed grammar error analysis, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed hybrid model includes a multifaceted relevance module (integrating question, image, exemplar, and spoken response) and fine-grained grammar error features (using GEC and detailed annotation).

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in evaluating content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance.

Conclusion: Richer, nuanced feature sets enhance holistic speaking assessment, addressing prior deficiencies in ASA systems.

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset for LLM safety in Polish is introduced, with adversarial samples to test robustness. Experiments show a HerBERT-based classifier outperforms others, especially under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety assessments for LLMs are biased toward high-resource languages, leaving global languages like Polish underexamined.

Method: A manually annotated benchmark dataset for Polish is created, including adversarial variants. Three models (Llama-Guard-3-8B, HerBERT-based classifier, PLLuM) are fine-tuned and evaluated.

Result: The HerBERT-based classifier achieves the highest performance, particularly in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for language-specific safety tools and demonstrates the effectiveness of a HerBERT-based approach for Polish.

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the
highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the generalization of the Media Frame Corpus (MFC) to Brazilian Portuguese news, finding it broadly applicable but with some limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well MFC frames, designed for U.S. news, apply to Brazilian political and economic news.

Method: Introduce FrameNews-PT, annotate it using MFC, and evaluate frame generalization through annotation rounds and model performance.

Result: MFC frames are mostly applicable but require minor guideline revisions; some frames are rarely used, and fall-back frames are common.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural frame analysis needs careful adaptation due to contextual differences.

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

Motivation: To test if entity positions in knowledge graphs enhance relation extraction performance.

Method: Combined established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford networks, tested in supervised and zero-shot settings.

Result: Significant performance improvements, particularly in imbalanced training scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledge graph integration boosts relation extraction, proving its value across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We examine the impact of incorporating knowledge graph information on the
performance of relation extraction models across a range of datasets. Our
hypothesis is that the positions of entities within a knowledge graph provide
important insights for relation extraction tasks. We conduct experiments on
multiple datasets, each varying in the number of relations, training examples,
and underlying knowledge graphs. Our results demonstrate that integrating
knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance relation extraction accuracy, particularly for long-tail relations, and improve efficiency in large-scale closed information extraction tasks.

Method: Uses a discriminative approach incorporating type and entity-specific information, leveraging smaller models for efficiency.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art generative models, achieving comparable or better results with smaller models.

Conclusion: The method advances accurate and efficient information extraction, especially for large-scale tasks with numerous entities and relations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

### [360] [Can structural correspondences ground real world representational content in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16370)
*Iwan Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs can represent real-world entities, concluding that structural correspondences alone are insufficient unless they play a functional role in task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs, which lack direct interaction with reality, can represent anything and what they might represent.

Method: Uses a structural-correspondence based account of representation and surveys existing evidence.

Result: Structural correspondences alone don't ground representation; they must functionally explain task success.

Conclusion: LLMs could represent real-world contents if structural correspondences are exploited functionally, despite their text-bounded nature.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

Method: The authors propose InstructTTSEval, a benchmark with three tasks (Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, Role-Play) across English and Chinese, totaling 6k test cases with reference audio. Gemini is used as an automatic judge.

Result: Evaluation reveals significant room for improvement in current instruction-following TTS systems.

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval aims to advance the development of more flexible and accurate instruction-driven TTS models.

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more
powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.

*Chenyi Zhou,Zhengyan Shi,Yuan Yao,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiOT is a new framework for automatic prompt optimization in LLMs, addressing diversity and semantic drift issues by iteratively refining prompts with text gradients and residual connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods lack diversity and suffer from semantic drift, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RiOT uses text gradients to generate diverse prompt candidates, selects the best via perplexity, and employs residual connections to retain beneficial content. A tree structure manages scalability.

Result: RiOT outperforms previous methods and manual prompting across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: RiOT effectively addresses diversity and semantic drift, offering a scalable and flexible solution for prompt optimization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAnnotator is a multi-model cooperative annotation framework that reduces costs and improves accuracy by leveraging LLMs for selection and SLMs for voting, with reinforcement learning for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and low accuracy of LLMs in fine-grained annotation tasks by proposing a cooperative approach between LLMs and SLMs.

Method: A two-layer framework: meta-controller (LLMs for selection, code generation, and verification) and task-specialist (SLMs for voting). Uses reinforcement learning for SLM fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing LLMs in various settings, reduces cost by 74.15%, and improves accuracy by 6.21% compared to GPT-3.5-turbo.

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator offers a cost-effective and accurate solution for large-scale annotation tasks by combining LLMs and SLMs.

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the rigor to assess competitive-level code reasoning in LLMs.

Method: OJBench includes 232 programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, tested on 37 models.

Result: Top models like o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-pro-exp struggle with competitive-level problems.

Conclusion: Competitive-level code reasoning remains a significant challenge for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NepaliGPT, the first generative LLM for the Nepali language, addressing the lack of such models and downstream tasks. It also presents a new corpus (Devanagari Corpus) and a benchmark dataset (4,296 QA pairs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a generative language model for Nepali hinders NLP research and applications in the language, prompting the development of NepaliGPT.

Method: The research collects a Nepali corpus (Devanagari Corpus) and creates a benchmark dataset. NepaliGPT is then developed and evaluated using metrics like perplexity, ROUGE-1, and causal coherence/consistency.

Result: NepaliGPT achieves a perplexity of 26.32245, ROUGE-1 score of 0.2604, causal coherence of 81.25%, and causal consistency of 85.41%.

Conclusion: NepaliGPT successfully fills the gap in Nepali NLP, providing a foundation for future research and applications.

Abstract: After the release of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained huge
popularity in recent days and thousands of variants of LLMs have been released.
However, there is no generative language model for the Nepali language, due to
which other downstream tasks, including fine-tuning, have not been explored
yet. To fill this research gap in the Nepali NLP space, this research proposes
\textit{NepaliGPT}, a generative large language model tailored specifically for
the Nepali language. This research introduces an advanced corpus for the Nepali
language collected from several sources, called the Devanagari Corpus.
Likewise, the research introduces the first NepaliGPT benchmark dataset
comprised of 4,296 question-answer pairs in the Nepali language. The proposed
LLM NepaliGPT achieves the following metrics in text generation: Perplexity of
26.32245, ROUGE-1 score of 0.2604, causal coherence of 81.25\%, and causal
consistency of 85.41\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for understanding failure modes in LLMs when processing long texts and validates multi-agent chunking as an effective strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of applying LLMs to long texts by identifying and categorizing failure modes.

Method: Theoretical framework categorizing failure modes into cross-chunk dependence, model noise, and aggregator noise, followed by experiments on tasks like retrieval and summarization.

Result: Multi-agent chunking is effective under certain conditions, and weaker models with chunking can outperform stronger models like GPT4o for large inputs.

Conclusion: A principled framework and chunking strategies offer a pathway to better handle long contexts in LLMs.

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REIS is an ISP system for RAG that improves retrieval performance and energy efficiency by optimizing data layout, placement, and leveraging existing storage resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' static knowledge limits their effectiveness; RAG integrates external knowledge but faces bottlenecks in retrieval due to inefficient ANNS.

Method: REIS introduces three mechanisms: efficient database layout, ISP-tailored data placement, and an ANNS engine using existing storage resources.

Result: REIS improves retrieval performance by 13x and energy efficiency by 55x compared to server-grade systems.

Conclusion: REIS effectively addresses RAG's retrieval bottlenecks with minimal hardware modifications, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

*Haotian Xia,Hao Peng,Yunjia Qi,Xiaozhi Wang,Bin Xu,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StoryWriter, a multi-agent framework, addresses long story generation challenges by using outline, planning, and writing agents to ensure coherence and narrative complexity, outperforming baselines and generating a high-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with long story generation due to issues in discourse coherence and narrative complexity.

Method: Proposes StoryWriter with three modules: outline agent (event-based outlines), planning agent (detailed event planning), and writing agent (dynamic history compression).

Result: Outperforms baselines in story quality and length, generates a dataset of 6,000 long stories (~8,000 words each), and fine-tunes models (Llama3.1-8B, GLM4-9B) for advanced performance.

Conclusion: StoryWriter effectively addresses long story generation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect implicit hate speech in existing harmful speech datasets using lexicon analysis, influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation with Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o, achieving a +12.9 F1 score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit hate speech is a growing challenge for social media, but existing datasets often miss or mislabel it due to annotator subjectivity.

Method: The approach involves lexicon analysis, influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o.

Result: The method improves implicit hate detection by +12.9 F1 score over the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances the detection of implicit hate speech in diverse datasets.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIC improves reward model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages by using in-context learning with high-resource language examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual reward models are unreliable for low-resource Indic languages due to lack of preference data.

Method: RELIC uses a retriever with pairwise ranking to select high-resource language examples for in-context learning.

Result: RELIC outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy by up to 12.81% on low-resource languages like Bodo.

Conclusion: RELIC is a practical solution for reward modeling in low-resource languages without costly data collection.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example
selection method, respectively.

*Dana Serditova,Kevin Tang,Jochen Steffens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASR systems perform poorly on regional dialects like Newcastle English due to biased training. This study identifies dialectal features as the main cause of errors, advocating for more diverse training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate underexamined regional bias in ASR systems, focusing on Newcastle English, and understand the causes of misrecognitions.

Method: A two-stage analysis: manual error analysis of phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors, followed by a case study on regional pronouns.

Result: ASR errors correlate with dialectal features, with social factors playing a minor role.

Conclusion: Greater dialectal diversity in training data and sociolinguistic analysis are needed to address regional biases.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

*Enes Yavuz Ugan,Ngoc-Quan Pham,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A continual learning approach for neural speech recognition models prevents catastrophic forgetting by using factorization and centralization phases, inspired by human learning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural networks to absorb new data without full re-training, avoiding catastrophic forgetting in rehearsal-free, multilingual settings.

Method: Proposes a two-phase approach: factorization (learning) and centralization (merging knowledge), using low-rank adapters.

Result: Effective prevention of catastrophic forgetting in experiments with varied code-switching datasets.

Conclusion: The centralization phase successfully accumulates knowledge, preserving model quality without full re-training.

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time processing of accent conversion while maintaining speaker identity and prosody, addressing the lack of streaming-capable AC models.

Method: Modifies a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and optimized inference, integrating a native TTS model for training data.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to top AC models with stable latency, enabling the first streaming AC system.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully enables streaming accent conversion without compromising performance or latency.

Abstract: We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms
non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity,
prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by
modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized
inference mechanism. Additionally, we integrate a native text-to-speech (TTS)
model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming
AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining
stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.

### [376] [Measuring (a Sufficient) World Model in LLMs: A Variance Decomposition Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16584)
*Nadav Kunievsky,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate if LLMs have a robust world model by analyzing response variability across semantically equivalent prompts. Larger models show more consistency in attributing variability to user purpose, indicating a stronger world model, but improvements are not uniform across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing LLMs' reliability in high-stakes applications requires understanding if they possess a structured world model, not just surface-level pattern recognition.

Method: A formal framework decomposes model response variability into user purpose, user articulation, and model instability to quantify semantic grounding.

Result: Larger models attribute more variability to user purpose, suggesting a stronger world model, but this advantage is modest and inconsistent across domains.

Conclusion: Semantic diagnostics are crucial for evaluating LLMs' internal understanding, moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks to assess world model robustness.

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a
structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond
surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in
high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's

### [378] [Modeling Public Perceptions of Science in Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16622)
*Jiaxin Pei,Dustin Wright,Isabelle Augenstin,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework models public perception of science news across 12 dimensions, using a large dataset and NLP models to predict engagement. Findings show science news consumption drives perception, and positive perception correlates with higher engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public engagement with science is crucial but challenging due to information overload. Understanding and predicting public perception can improve science communication.

Method: Developed a computational framework and NLP models to analyze public perception using a dataset of 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants. Examined perception as both an outcome and predictor of engagement.

Result: Science news consumption frequency drives perception, while demographics have minimal impact. Positive perception scores correlate with higher engagement (comments, upvotes).

Conclusion: Nuanced perception modeling enhances science communication, enabling better prediction of public interest and engagement with scientific content.

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

### [379] [Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16628)
*Jianlin Shi,Brian T. Bucher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to automate rule-based NLP system development, achieving high recall in clinical text snippet identification and key term extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based NLP systems are labor-intensive to develop and maintain, despite their interpretability and efficiency in clinical settings.

Method: Employ LLMs during the development phase for snippet identification and key term extraction in rule-based NLP pipelines.

Result: High recall in snippet identification (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and perfect key term extraction (1.0).

Conclusion: LLMs can semi-automate rule-based NLP development, offering faster, cost-effective, and transparent solutions compared to deep learning.

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

### [380] [GeoGuess: Multimodal Reasoning based on Hierarchy of Visual Information in Street View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16633)
*Fenghua Cheng,Jinxiang Wang,Sen Wang,Zi Huang,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoGuess, a novel multimodal reasoning task requiring hierarchical visual and geographic knowledge integration, and presents the SightSense method for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning tasks lack focus on hierarchical visual clues (local details and global context), which are crucial in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose SightSense, a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, and introduce the GeoExplain dataset for benchmarking.

Result: SightSense demonstrates outstanding performance in the GeoGuess task.

Conclusion: GeoGuess and SightSense address the gap in hierarchical multimodal reasoning, offering a robust benchmark and solution.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

### [381] [Long-Context Generalization with Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16640)
*Pavlo Vasylenko,Marcos Treviso,André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASEntmax, a sparse attention mechanism using α-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, to improve focus on fixed-size patterns in transformers, outperforming softmax and other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax attention in transformers disperses focus on non-informative tokens for tasks requiring precise pattern recognition, leading to representational collapse.

Method: Proposes ASEntmax, which combines α-entmax with a learnable temperature to adapt between sparse and dense attention regimes, and optimizes position encodings.

Result: ASEntmax-integrated transformers outperform softmax and fixed-temperature α-entmax baselines in long-context generalization.

Conclusion: Sparse attention with ASEntmax and optimized position encodings enhances transformer performance for tasks needing precise pattern focus.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

*Co Tran,Salman Paracha,Adil Hafeez,Shuguang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Arch-Router, a 1.5B model for preference-aligned LLM routing, outperforming SOTA by matching queries to user-defined domains/actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing lacks human preference alignment and flexibility in model selection.

Method: Introduces Arch-Router, a compact model mapping queries to domain-action preferences for routing.

Result: Achieves SOTA in aligning queries with human preferences, outperforming proprietary models.

Conclusion: Arch-Router offers transparent, flexible routing with subjective criteria support and easy model addition.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

### [383] [Mechanisms vs. Outcomes: Probing for Syntax Fails to Explain Performance on Targeted Syntactic Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16678)
*Ananth Agarwal,Jasper Jian,Christopher D. Manning,Shikhar Murty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probing syntactic features in LLMs doesn't reliably predict downstream syntactic performance, revealing a disconnect between latent representations and observable behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if syntactic features extracted via probing in LLMs correlate with their actual syntactic performance in downstream tasks.

Method: Evaluated 32 open-weight transformer models using a 'mechanisms vs. outcomes' framework, comparing probing-extracted syntactic features with targeted syntax evaluations.

Result: Syntactic features from probing failed to predict downstream syntactic performance, showing a disconnect.

Conclusion: Probing alone is insufficient to explain LLMs' syntactic behaviors, highlighting the need for deeper interpretability research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

### [384] [LegiGPT: Party Politics and Transport Policy with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16692)
*Hyunsoo Yun,Eun Hak Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LegiGPT combines LLM and XAI to analyze transportation-related legislative proposals, revealing key factors like political affiliations and sponsor characteristics that influence policymaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of lawmakers' political ideologies on legislative decision-making, especially in transportation policy.

Method: LegiGPT uses a multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline with GPT-4 and XAI techniques on South Korea's 21st National Assembly data.

Result: Conservative and progressive sponsors, district size, and electoral population significantly shape legislative outcomes.

Conclusion: The framework aids in understanding legislative dynamics and guiding policy development, with broader implications for governance.

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

### [385] [ReasonGRM: Enhancing Generative Reward Models through Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16712)
*Bin Chen,Xinzge Gao,Chuanrui Hu,Penghang Yu,Hua Zhang,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonGRM improves Generative Reward Models (GRMs) by introducing a three-stage framework to enhance reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and improve preference modeling, outperforming previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRMs lack strong reasoning capabilities, leading to incomplete or speculative reasoning paths and hallucinations in complex tasks.

Method: A three-stage framework: 1) Zero-RL for concise reasoning paths, 2) $R^\star$ metric for scoring paths, and 3) reinforcement learning for refinement.

Result: ReasonGRM outperforms prior GRMs by 1.8% and proprietary models like GPT-4o by up to 5.6% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware training and high-quality rationale selection are crucial for reliable preference modeling.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

### [386] [The Role of Model Confidence on Bias Effects in Measured Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16724)
*Xinyi Liu,Weiguang Wang,Hangfeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how bias affects epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in LLMs like GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL, finding that bias mitigation improves uncertainty quantification, especially when model confidence is low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty in LLMs is crucial for reliable outcomes, but it's complicated by aleatoric uncertainty and bias.

Method: Experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL, analyzing the impact of bias on uncertainty.

Result: Bias mitigation improves uncertainty quantification; lower bias-free confidence leads to greater underestimation of epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of bias effects on uncertainty and may guide advanced techniques for better uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

### [387] [LM-SPT: LM-Aligned Semantic Distillation for Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16738)
*Daejin Jo,Jeeyoung Yun,Byungseok Roh,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-SPT introduces a novel semantic distillation method for speech tokenization, improving alignment with language models and supporting multiple frame rates, outperforming baselines in speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of long speech token sequences in speech-language modeling by improving semantic alignment and reducing frame rate without distorting semantic structure.

Method: Proposes LM-SPT, which reconstructs speech from semantic tokens and minimizes discrepancy between original and reconstructed waveforms using a frozen ASR encoder, alongside architectural improvements.

Result: LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity and enables SLMs to perform competitively in speech-to-text and outperform baselines in text-to-speech tasks.

Conclusion: LM-SPT effectively bridges the gap between speech and text modalities by enhancing semantic alignment and supporting flexible frame rates, advancing speech-language modeling.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform
baselines on text-to-speech tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIRAS integrates linguistic and visual inputs for social reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art models in capturing human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social inferences often require multimodal inputs, with language providing abstract and concrete details in novel situations.

Method: LIRAS combines multimodal language models for parsing inputs into symbolic representations and a Bayesian inverse planning engine for probabilistic judgments.

Result: LIRAS outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in social reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LIRAS effectively integrates language and vision for context-specific social inferences, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocialSim is a framework for simulating emotional support conversations (ESC) by integrating social disclosure and awareness, outperforming crowdsourced data in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ESC simulations overlook social dynamics, leading to ineffective results. SocialSim addresses this gap.

Method: SocialSim uses a persona bank for social disclosure and cognitive reasoning for social awareness, creating the SSConv corpus.

Result: SSConv surpasses crowdsourced ESC data in quality, and a chatbot trained on it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SocialSim provides a scalable, high-quality method for synthesizing ESC, enhancing accessibility to emotional care.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMO is a stealthy, efficient jailbreak attack framework for LVLMs, bypassing safety mechanisms by decomposing malicious prompts into benign visual and textual fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak methods are detectable and inefficient; CAMO aims to exploit LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning for covert attacks.

Method: Decomposes harmful prompts into benign fragments, leverages cross-modal reasoning to reconstruct instructions, and evades detection.

Result: CAMO is effective, efficient, and transferable across LVLMs, exposing vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for advanced security solutions in vision-language systems to counter such attacks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Distillnote is an LLM-based framework for clinical note summarization, achieving 79% text compression and improved predictive performance for heart failure. Clinicians prefer one-step summaries for relevance, while distilled summaries excel in efficiency and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the burden of clinical documentation by generating concise summaries of patient information using LLMs.

Method: Three techniques: (1) One-step summarization, (2) Structured summarization, and (3) Distilled summarization. Evaluated using predictive performance (AUPRC), LLM-as-judge, and clinician comparisons.

Result: Distilled summaries achieve 79% compression and 18.2% AUPRC improvement. One-step summaries are favored for relevance; distilled summaries reduce hallucinations.

Conclusion: Distillnote effectively balances efficiency and quality in clinical note summarization, with potential to aid healthcare providers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

Motivation: Despite alignment efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to discrete inputs, restricted access, and limited queries.

Method: MIST uses iterative semantic tuning with sequential synonym search and order-determining optimization to refine prompts for harmful content.

Result: MIST achieves competitive success rates and transferability across open- and closed-source models, with validated computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MIST is a practical and effective method for jailbreaking black-box LLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

### [393] [From Data to Knowledge: Evaluating How Efficiently Language Models Learn Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16912)
*Daniel Christoph,Max Ploner,Patrick Haller,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how language models of varying architectures and sizes perform on high- and low-frequency facts, revealing differences in sample efficiency for rare information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how models handle the challenge of learning and retaining rare information in long-tailed data distributions, which is crucial for practical training efficiency.

Method: Analyzing multiple models trained on the same data, annotating relational facts by frequency, and comparing performance across fact frequencies.

Result: Most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ significantly on low-frequency facts.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how model architecture and size impact factual learning efficiency, especially for rare information.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the
relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

### [394] [Language Bottleneck Models: A Framework for Interpretable Knowledge Tracing and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16982)
*Antonin Berthon,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) for Knowledge Tracing (KT), using interpretable natural-language summaries to improve accuracy and transparency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KT methods lack interpretability, and LLM-based approaches may produce unreliable predictions. The paper aims to address these issues by framing KT as an inverse problem.

Method: The LBM uses an encoder LLM to generate interpretable summaries and a frozen decoder LLM to predict student responses. Training involves group-relative policy optimization for better summaries.

Result: LBMs match state-of-the-art KT and LLM methods in accuracy while requiring fewer student trajectories, as shown on synthetic and Eedi datasets.

Conclusion: LBMs offer a transparent and accurate alternative to traditional KT methods, leveraging natural-language summaries for interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeXpert, a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate LaTeX code from natural language prompts, revealing performance gaps and common errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack evaluation of LLMs' ability to generate LaTeX code for scientific documents, despite its importance for researchers.

Method: The authors created TeXpert, a dataset with natural language prompts for LaTeX generation across difficulty levels, and evaluated LLMs (open and closed-source) on it.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in LaTeX generation, with accuracy dropping as task complexity increases. Open-source models rival closed-source ones, and formatting/package errors are common.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for more diverse LaTeX training data for LLMs and provides a benchmark (TeXpert) for future evaluations.

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold
standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models
(LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce
publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet
current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing
TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating
LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple
difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this
regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and
closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard
benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack
of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset,
code, and model evaluations are available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes using knowledge graphs with standard edges and hyperedges to personalize language models, demonstrating robustness in benchmarks like TriviaQA and DiaASQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of retaining and utilizing extensive personal information in language models for personalized responses.

Method: Utilizing external memory via knowledge graphs (extended AriGraph architecture) with standard edges and two types of hyperedges, tested on TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ benchmarks.

Result: Improved robustness in graph construction and knowledge extraction, with maintained performance even after augmenting DiaASQ with temporal and contradictory elements.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively handles temporal dependencies and personalization in language models.

Abstract: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to
account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest.
Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of
retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized
responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated feedback shows moderate learning benefits in tutor training, with effectiveness linked to learners' tendency to seek support, without increasing completion time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of LLM-generated feedback on learning compared to traditional methods, especially in tutor training.

Method: Analyzed 2,600 lesson completions from 885 learners across three groups (LLM feedback, declined, no access) using propensity scoring to address selection bias.

Result: Two out of seven lessons showed significant learning benefits (effect sizes 0.28, 0.33). LLM feedback was rated helpful and did not increase completion time.

Conclusion: LLM feedback is a scalable, low-cost tool for improving learning in open-ended tasks, especially in systems already providing feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

Motivation: To address the challenge of instruction following in speech processing with a unified model, leveraging small-scale language models and high-quality data.

Method: A two-phase approach: modality alignment of a pre-trained speech encoder and text decoder, followed by instruction fine-tuning. Uses small-scale language models (< 2B) and high-quality CC-BY data, supplemented with synthetic data.

Result: Submitted results for the Short Track (speech recognition, translation, and spoken question answering) at IWSLT 2025.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUCAR is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on multilingual and dual-ambiguity scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, failing to leverage cross-modal disambiguation. MUCAR aims to address this gap.

Method: MUCAR includes a multilingual dataset and a dual-ambiguity dataset, designed to test mutual disambiguation between modalities.

Result: Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps compared to humans, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: MUCAR highlights the need for advanced cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods to enhance multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance simultaneous speech translation performance across multiple language pairs using advanced models and policies.

Method: Utilizes Whisper for translation/transcription in simultaneous mode with AlignAtt, in-domain prompting, and EuroLLM for cascaded systems.

Result: BLEU improvements: +2 (Czech-English), +13-22 (English-German/Chinese/Japanese). Proposed new latency measure.

Conclusion: The approach significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating effectiveness of Whisper and AlignAtt in simultaneous tasks.

Abstract: This paper describes Charles University submission to the Simultaneous Speech
Translation Task of the IWSLT 2025. We cover all four language pairs with a
direct or cascade approach. The backbone of our systems is the offline Whisper
speech model, which we use for both translation and transcription in
simultaneous mode with the state-of-the-art simultaneous policy AlignAtt. We
further improve the performance by prompting to inject in-domain terminology,
and we accommodate context. Our cascaded systems further use EuroLLM for
unbounded simultaneous translation. Compared to the Organizers' baseline, our
systems improve by 2 BLEU points on Czech to English and 13-22 BLEU points on
English to German, Chinese and Japanese on the development sets. Additionally,
we also propose a new enhanced measure of speech recognition latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tower+ is a suite of models balancing translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities, outperforming larger models in both domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks like translation often sacrifices general-purpose capabilities, limiting real-world utility. Tower+ aims to address this trade-off.

Method: A novel training recipe combining continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, using carefully curated data.

Result: Smaller Tower+ models outperform larger general-purpose LLMs, while the largest model excels in translation and multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: Tower+ demonstrates that optimizing for specific domains (e.g., translation) doesn't require sacrificing general capabilities, rivaling frontier models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT prompting reduces LLM hallucinations but weakens detection signals, revealing a trade-off in reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting impacts hallucination detection in LLMs, given its underexplored effects.

Method: Systematic empirical evaluation, including pilot experiments and analysis of CoT's impact on hallucination score distributions, detection accuracy, and confidence.

Result: CoT reduces hallucination frequency but obscures detection signals, impairing detection methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off between reasoning benefits and detection effectiveness in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PILS method recovers hidden prompts from language model outputs using next-token probabilities, achieving 2--3.5x higher recovery rates and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses security risks like leaking private info from API-protected models by improving prompt inversion.

Method: Uses next-token probabilities and a linear map to compress distributions, enabling more effective inversion.

Result: Achieves 2--3.5x higher exact recovery rates, e.g., from 17% to 60%, and generalizes well to more steps.

Conclusion: Next-token probabilities are a vulnerable attack surface, and PILS significantly outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the *KV footprint* metric to evaluate memory efficiency in language models, highlighting issues with prior KV eviction methods and proposing improvements like *post-fill eviction* adaptation and *PruLong* for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing memory costs of KV caches in long-context language models, the paper aims to unify evaluation and improve eviction methods.

Method: Proposes *KV footprint* as a metric, adapts *post-fill eviction* methods, and introduces *PruLong* for optimized recency eviction.

Result: *PruLong* achieves a 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while maintaining performance in recall tasks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a clearer framework for evaluating and improving KV cache efficiency in long-context language models.

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K is a dataset for evaluating causal reasoning in language models, revealing their tendency to confuse semantic similarity with causality and showing limited improvement with larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether language models can distinguish genuine causal relationships from semantic relatedness, a critical capability for applications requiring accurate causal reasoning.

Method: The study introduces CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions, and evaluates 21 state-of-the-art language models (0.5B to 72B parameters).

Result: Models often confuse semantic similarity with causality, and larger models shift from skepticism to permissiveness without significant performance gains (MCC plateaus at 0.55).

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K serves as a vital benchmark for advancing causal reasoning in language models, highlighting current limitations in distinguishing causal relationships.

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically

synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to

*Kathleen C. Fraser,Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs can unintentionally remove safety features, posing risks even with benign data. Safety benchmarks show high variance, raising concerns about evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical failure mode where fine-tuning LLMs removes safety alignment, unaware to developers, and exploited by malicious actors.

Method: Investigate robustness of safety benchmarks to trivial variations and stochastic nature of LLMs.

Result: High variance in safety evaluation results due to minor changes in fine-tuning setup.

Conclusion: Need for reliable safety evaluations and standardized reporting to enable meaningful comparisons.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

### [408] [LaMP-Cap: Personalized Figure Caption Generation With Multimodal Figure Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06561)
*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng,Ting-Yao Hsu,Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan,Branislav Kveton,Nedim Lipka,Franck Dernoncourt,Dongwon Lee,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation using multimodal profiles, showing that profile information improves caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated figure captions lack personalization and often require manual revision. Current personalization technologies focus on text-only settings, ignoring multimodal inputs and profiles.

Method: LaMP-Cap provides multimodal profiles (images, captions, and figure-mentioning paragraphs) for each target figure. Four LLMs were tested to evaluate the impact of profile information.

Result: Using profile information consistently improves caption generation, with images in the profile being more helpful than text-only elements.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles enhance personalized caption generation, outperforming text-only approaches.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to address challenges in near-field communications for low-altitude economy (LAE) systems, such as signal processing complexity and user distinction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage LLMs' problem-solving capabilities to enhance near-field communications in LAE, which aligns with XL-MIMO systems.

Method: The paper introduces LLM fundamentals and near-field communication characteristics, proposes an LLM-based scheme for LAE, and includes a case study on user distinction and precoding.

Result: The result is a framework for applying LLMs to near-field communications in LAE, addressing key challenges and demonstrating potential through a case study.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting future research directions and open issues in LLM-empowered near-field communications for LAE.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia
and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications
in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field
beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles,
while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency.
However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such
as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of
distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language
models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to
solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this
article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered
near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals
of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and
key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the
opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address
these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications
in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field
users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and
highlight several future research directions and open issues.

### [410] [DeepRTL2: A Versatile Model for RTL-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15697)
*Yi Liu,Hongji Zhang,Yunhao Zhou,Zhengyuan Shi,Changran Xu,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: DeepRTL2 is a versatile LLM addressing both generation- and embedding-based tasks in EDA, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work focused on generation-based tasks in EDA, neglecting embedding-based tasks critical for hardware design.

Method: DeepRTL2, a family of LLMs, unifies generation- and embedding-based tasks for RTL.

Result: DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks.

Conclusion: DeepRTL2 provides a comprehensive solution for diverse EDA challenges.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.
