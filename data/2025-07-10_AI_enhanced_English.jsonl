Deep\nlearning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved\ngood performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human\nperception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.\nConsequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual\nquality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE\nmethod with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss\nmodule and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a\nperception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual\nperception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model\nis leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the\nquality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated\nas a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the\nperceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model\nis integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the\nconstraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,\nmitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.\nSpecifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize\nthe learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,\nensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and\nnegatives with varied quality levels.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making.

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs exhibit linguistic overconfidence across languages, with varying reliance behaviors, highlighting risks of multilingual misalignment and the need for culturally aware safety evaluations.", "motivation": "To assess the risks of linguistic miscalibration and overreliance on LLMs in a global context, given differences in epistemic marker usage across languages.", "method": "Analyzed LLM-generated epistemic markers in five languages and measured human reliance rates on confident and uncertain generations.", "result": "LLMs are overconfident cross-linguistically but sensitive to linguistic variation.

More importantly, we propose a novel all-min\ncontrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,\nwhich adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar\ncategories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other\nparts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization.
