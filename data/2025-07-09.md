### [1] [Strongly Solving $7 \times 6$ Connect-Four on Consumer Grade Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05267)
*Markus Böck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a symbolic search method using binary decision diagrams to create a strong solution look-up table for Connect-Four, achieving a 89.6 GB table in 47 hours on a single CPU core.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Connect-Four being mathematically solved, a strong solution via look-up tables was deemed infeasible. This work revisits symbolic search to address this challenge.

Method: The authors employ binary decision diagrams for symbolic search, efficiently generating a look-up table. They also integrate an alpha-beta search for optimal move selection.

Result: A 89.6 GB look-up table was produced in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB memory, alongside an open-source tool for move optimization.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of strong solutions via symbolic search, providing practical tools for Connect-Four analysis.

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

### [2] [Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283)
*Yue Wang,Miao Zhou,Guijing Huang,Rui Zhuo,Chao Yi,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT uses LLMs to convert semi-structured traffic signal control descriptions into exact SPaT results, achieving over 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual traffic signal plan management is tedious and repetitive, especially with multiple plans per intersection.

Method: Leverages LLMs to understand descriptions, reformat into JSON, and uses Python scripts to assemble complete plans.

Result: Achieves over 94% accuracy in generating plans from descriptions in English and Chinese.

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT offers an easy-to-use, accurate solution for traffic signal plan management, enhancing LLM applications in ITS.

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

*Zijun Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation for 3+ objects into 2+ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the necessary form of aggregation functions under specific conditions for fuzzy classification.

Method: Analyzing properties (optimality, independence, zero unanimity) of fuzzy classification aggregation functions.

Result: The only valid aggregation function is a weighted arithmetic mean.

Conclusion: Weighted arithmetic mean is the sole solution for such fuzzy classification aggregation.

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy
classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual
classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean.

### [4] [OLG++: A Semantic Extension of Obligation Logic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05488)
*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jon Stephens,Amarnath Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OLG++ extends Obligation Logic Graph (OLG) with richer semantic constructs for legal rules, improving expressiveness and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance legal rule modeling with nuanced representations of obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies in regulatory contexts.

Method: Introduces spatial, temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs in OLG++. Demonstrates expressiveness via food business regulations and LegalRuleML comparisons.

Result: OLG++ outperforms prior graph-based models in legal knowledge representation, supporting complex reasoning and contextual conditions.

Conclusion: OLG++ is a more expressive and capable model for legal rule representation and reasoning compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

### [5] [Deep Research Comparator: A Platform For Fine-grained Human Annotations of Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05495)
*Prahaladh Chandrahasan,Jiahe Jin,Zhihan Zhang,Tevin Wang,Andy Tang,Lucy Mo,Morteza Ziyadi,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Zimeng Qiu,Markus Dreyer,Akari Asai,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Research Comparator, a platform for evaluating deep research agents by comparing their outputs and collecting detailed feedback. It also presents Simple Deepresearch, a baseline agent scaffold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating deep research agents is challenging, especially for long reports and intermediate steps. The platform aims to address these gaps.

Method: The platform hosts agents, compares their outputs side-by-side, collects fine-grained feedback, and ranks them. It also includes Simple Deepresearch as a baseline scaffold.

Result: Real user preference data from 17 annotators was collected, demonstrating the platform's utility for agent development.

Conclusion: The Deep Research Comparator platform effectively evaluates and improves deep research agents, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

### [6] [Fine-Grained Vision-Language Modeling for Multimodal Training Assistants in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05515)
*Haochen Huang,Jiahuan Pei,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Xin Sun,Moonisa Ahsan,Pablo Cesar,Chuang Yu,Zhaochun Ren,Junxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for AR training, evaluates VLMs, and finds gaps in fine-grained vision-language alignment, advocating for improved datasets and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of VLMs in AR training and address the lack of fine-grained vision-language alignment, especially for tasks like assembly and state detection.

Method: The authors created a dataset for AR training with systematized vision-language tasks and evaluated nine state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o.

Result: Advanced VLMs, like GPT-4o, perform poorly on fine-grained tasks (max F1 score: 40.54%), indicating a need for better alignment.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for enhanced datasets and benchmarks to improve VLMs for AR training, with broader social implications for accessibility.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

### [7] [Modeling (Deontic) Modal Operators With the s(CASP) Goal-directed Predicated Answer Set Programming System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05519)
*Gopal Gupta,Abhiramon Rajasekharan,Alexis R. Tudor,Elmer Salazar,Joaquín Arias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using answer set programming (ASP) to implement deontic modal logic, resolving its paradoxes elegantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of implementing deontic modal logic and resolving its paradoxes.

Method: Uses default negation and strong negation in ASP, along with global constraints, to represent obligations and impermissibilities.

Result: The proposed representation elegantly resolves the paradoxes of deontic modal logic.

Conclusion: ASP provides an effective framework for implementing and resolving issues in deontic modal logic.

Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how
(deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation
(negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming
(ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and
impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed
representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being
elegantly resolved.

### [8] [Cultivating Multimodal Intelligence: Interpretive Reasoning and Agentic RAG Approaches to Dermatological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05520)
*Karishma Thakrar,Shreyas Basavatia,Akshay Daftardar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a multimodal approach for dermatology question answering, combining fine-tuned models, structured reasoning, and agentic RAG, achieving competitive results in the ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of accurate and interpretable diagnostic decisions in telemedicine, especially with limited input.

Method: Fine-tunes Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA models, adds structured reasoning, and incorporates agentic RAG for context enhancement.

Result: Achieved second place in the competition, demonstrating high accuracy and competitive performance.

Conclusion: The approach emulates dermatologists' reasoning, offering a reliable pathway for automated diagnostic support systems.

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner
conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics.
Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with
human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in
diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our

### [10] [Red Teaming AI Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05538)
*Subhabrata Majumdar,Brian Pendleton,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques AI red teaming for its narrow focus on model flaws, proposing a two-level framework (macro and micro) to address broader sociotechnical risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the gap between red teaming's original intent and its current narrow application in AI governance, especially in generative AI.

Method: Proposes a comprehensive framework with macro-level (system-wide) and micro-level (model-specific) red teaming, informed by cybersecurity and systems theory.

Result: Identifies the need for multifunctional teams to examine emergent risks and systemic vulnerabilities in AI systems.

Conclusion: Effective AI red teaming must integrate technical and social factors, addressing broader system behaviors beyond individual model flaws.

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

*Shovito Barua Soumma,Asiful Arefeen,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Melanie Hingle,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o-mini for generating counterfactual explanations (CFs) in zero-shot and three-shot settings, outperforming traditional methods in plausibility, validity, and sparsity. LLM-generated CFs also improve downstream classifier performance by 5% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating human-centric counterfactual explanations (CFs) that enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and physiological prediction tasks.

Method: Uses GPT-4o-mini in zero-shot and three-shot settings to generate CFs, evaluated on stress prediction (AI-Readi dataset) and heart disease detection (public dataset). Compares results with traditional methods (DiCE, CFNOW, NICE).

Result: Achieves high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive sparsity. LLM-generated CFs improve downstream classifier accuracy by 5% on average, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Prompt-based generative techniques with LLMs like GPT-4o-mini can effectively enhance explainability and robustness in clinical prediction tasks, outperforming traditional CF generation methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

### [12] [SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05566)
*David Bensaïd,Noam Rotstein,Roy Velich,Daniel Bensaïd,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA improves LoRA by reformulating low-rank adaptation as a single matrix decomposition, ensuring stable training and reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scale disparities in LoRA's two-matrix approach, which causes unstable training and suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes SingLoRA, a decomposition of a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose, eliminating scale conflicts and halving parameters.

Result: Achieves better performance (e.g., 91.3% accuracy on MNLI with LLama 7B) and efficiency (60% parameter budget) compared to LoRA and LoRA+.

Conclusion: SingLoRA offers a stable, parameter-efficient alternative to LoRA, validated across tasks like reasoning and image generation.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal theory of AI measurement is proposed to enable comparisons, connect AI evaluations with risk analysis, and highlight the contingency of AI capabilities on measurement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize AI measurement for better comparisons, risk analysis integration, and understanding of capability measurement.

Method: Introduces a layered measurement stack, distinguishes direct from indirect observables, and outlines a unified taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Result: Provides a pathway for a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Conclusion: Formalizing AI measurement can enhance research, practice, and regulation by clarifying comparisons and risk analysis.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,En Zhu,Wenhong Cheng,YunPeng Li,Yanbo J. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes MLlm-DR, a multimodal LLM for explainable depression diagnosis, integrating a smaller LLM and LQ-former for feature extraction, achieving top results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack explainability and multimodal LLMs are untrained on interview data, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: Combines a smaller LLM for score/rationale generation and LQ-former for multimodal feature extraction, trained on a robust dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ datasets.

Conclusion: MLlm-DR offers effective, explainable depression diagnosis, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,Yanbo J. Wang,En Zhu,Xuan Yang,Yiduo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADMC, an Attention-based Diffusion model for completing missing modalities in multimodal emotion and intent recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of missing modalities in human-computer interaction, which traditional methods handle poorly due to over-coupling and imprecise generation.

Method: ADMC independently trains feature extraction for each modality and uses an Attention-based Diffusion Network (ADN) to generate missing features, preserving authenticity.

Result: Achieves top performance on IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, improving recognition in both missing and full-modality scenarios.

Conclusion: ADMC effectively handles missing modalities and enhances recognition, proving superior to traditional methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

*Yuan An,John Liu,Niyam Acharya,Ruhma Hashmi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-generated retrieval practice questions improve student knowledge retention (89% accuracy) compared to no retrieval practice (73%), but manual verification of question quality is still needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice questions in enhancing student learning, given the time-consuming nature of manual question creation.

Method: An empirical study in two college-level data science courses (60 students), comparing learning outcomes with and without LLM-generated retrieval practice.

Result: Students with LLM-generated questions achieved 89% accuracy vs. 73% without, showing significant improvement in knowledge retention.

Conclusion: LLM-generated retrieval practice is effective but requires manual quality checks to ensure question reliability.

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

*Litian Zhang,Xiaoming Zhang,Bingyu Yan,Ziyi Zhou,Bo Zhang,Zhenyu Guan,Xi Zhang,Chaozhuo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses misinformation spread on social media using LLMs, identifies gaps in simulating human behavior, and proposes SIP-CoT with emotion-guided memory to enhance realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of social media and generative AI has increased misinformation spread, necessitating better models to understand and control it, as traditional methods fall short.

Method: The study introduces an LLM-based simulation environment, identifies gaps in human-like behavior, and proposes SIP-CoT with emotion-guided memory to improve social information processing.

Result: SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents show improved social intelligence and realism, better mimicking human interactions in stance detection and psychological dynamics.

Conclusion: The research highlights LLM limitations in simulating human behavior and demonstrates SIP-CoT's effectiveness in enhancing social intelligence and realism.

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

### [19] [City-Level Foreign Direct Investment Prediction with Tabular Learning on Judicial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05651)
*Tianxing Wu,Lizhe Cao,Shuang Wang,Jiming Wang,Shutong Zhu,Yerong Wu,Yuqing Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction, leveraging judicial performance data to improve reliability over traditional economic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FDI predictions rely on economic data like GDP, which can be manipulated. Judicial data offers a more reliable alternative by reflecting investment security and returns.

Method: TLJD integrates row and column data from a tabular dataset of judicial performance indicators, using a mixture of experts model to adjust weights regionally.

Result: TLJD outperforms ten baselines, achieving at least 0.92 R2 in cross-city and cross-time FDI prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Judicial data enhances FDI prediction reliability, with TLJD proving effective and superior to existing methods.

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

*Dipayan Sengupta,Saumya Panda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares AI and human-generated dermatology treatment plans, revealing a significant evaluator effect: humans favor human plans, while an AI judge prefers AI plans, highlighting a reasoning gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of AI-generated treatment plans compared to human experts and explore the evaluator effect in clinical decision-making.

Method: Ten dermatologists and two AI models (GPT-4o and o3) created anonymized treatment plans for complex cases, evaluated by human peers and an AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using the same rubric.

Result: Humans scored human plans higher, while the AI judge favored AI plans, with the reasoning AI (o3) ranked highest by the AI judge but lowest by humans.

Conclusion: The evaluator's nature affects plan quality perception, revealing a gap between human heuristics and AI logic, necessitating synergistic human-AI systems for clinical integration.

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

### [21] [An autonomous agent for auditing and improving the reliability of clinical AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05755)
*Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ModelAuditor is a tool to audit AI models in clinical practice, identifying and mitigating failure modes caused by real-world variations in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often fail in real-world clinical settings due to minor variations, and current auditing methods are inefficient.

Method: ModelAuditor uses a self-reflective agent to simulate distribution shifts, generate reports, and recommend mitigations.

Result: It identifies failure modes, recovers 15-25% performance loss, and operates efficiently on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: ModelAuditor provides an accessible, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for auditing AI models in clinical practice.

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for real-time battery SoH monitoring in microgrids by analyzing discharge pulses post-charge, achieving accurate predictions with high explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SoH monitoring methods are limited in microgrids due to operational constraints, necessitating an innovative approach.

Method: Analyzes discharge pulses at the end of charge phase, using parameters of an equivalent electrical model to estimate SoH.

Result: Predicted battery degradation with ~1% mean absolute error and ~0.9 explainability score, validated on experimental data.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for integration into BMS, enabling optimized battery management in continuous operation.

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTA1, a GUI agent addressing task planning ambiguity and visual grounding challenges using test-time scaling and RL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve GUI agents' ability to autonomously complete tasks by resolving ambiguity in task planning and enhancing visual grounding accuracy.

Method: Proposes a test-time scaling method for action proposal selection and an RL-based model for precise visual grounding.

Result: GTA1 achieves high accuracies on benchmarks (e.g., 50.1% on Screenspot-Pro) and state-of-the-art task success rates (e.g., 45.2% on OSWorld).

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses GUI agent challenges, demonstrating superior performance and open-sourcing the solution.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

*Shuai Zhao,Yulin Zhang,Luwei Xiao,Xinyi Wu,Yanhao Jia,Zhongliang Guo,Xiaobao Wu,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Guoming Zhang,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROP, a Chinese dataset for ROP risk prediction, and Affective-ROPTester, a framework to evaluate LLMs' predictive capabilities and affective biases in ROP risk stratification. Results show LLMs perform better with external knowledge and exhibit affective biases, mitigated by positive emotional framing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' unexplored capacity in predicting ROP risk and investigate affective biases in their predictions.

Method: Proposed Affective-ROPTester framework with three prompting strategies (Instruction-based, CoT, ICL) and emotional elements to evaluate LLMs on the CROP dataset.

Result: LLMs perform poorly with intrinsic knowledge but improve with external inputs. Affective biases are observed, with positive framing reducing bias.

Conclusion: Affect-sensitive prompt engineering enhances diagnostic reliability, and Affective-ROPTester is useful for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

TL;DR: AI excels in games but lacks human-like intuition. The paper reviews cognitive psychology and introduces CogniPlay, a model for human-like decision-making in games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between AI's game performance and human-like intuitive decision-making.

Method: Review of cognitive psychology and prior models, leading to the development of CogniPlay.

Result: CogniPlay is introduced as a work-in-progress model for human-like behavior in General Game Playing.

Conclusion: CogniPlay aims to replicate human intuition in AI, addressing current limitations in game-playing systems.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neurosymbolic AR systems lack strong guarantees and deep synchronization between neural and symbolic components, limiting their potential.

Method: Introduces Neurosymbolic Transition Systems, pairing symbolic state with intuition and parallel state transitions over symbols and intuition.

Result: The proposed model aims to scale logical reasoning while retaining symbolic guarantees and can be implemented in a logic programming language.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic Transition Systems offer a promising paradigm for enhancing neurosymbolic AR tools by combining the strengths of symbolic and neural approaches.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decomposed approach to time series forecasting using Transformers, focusing on sequence representation, information extraction, and target projection, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting is challenging due to the need for effective sequence representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Task-specific difficulties require systematic solutions.

Method: Decomposes forecasting into three stages: input sequence representation, information extraction/memory construction, and target projection. Evaluates various modules (e.g., convolutional layers, self-attention) across seven benchmark datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with improved computational efficiency, reduced training/inference times, and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The decomposed approach effectively addresses task-specific challenges in time series forecasting, offering high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

Motivation: To enable AI to imagine scenes from music, bridging cross-modal understanding between audio and video.

Method: Construct a video-audio dataset, finetune Music Understanding LLaMA for MSI, and evaluate MusiScene's performance.

Result: MusiScene generates more contextually relevant captions than MU-LLaMA and enhances Video Background Music Generation.

Conclusion: MusiScene advances cross-modal music understanding and has practical applications in music generation.

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from

Motivation: To advance high-performance, on-device MLLMs with efficient training and explicit control over thinking tokens.

Method: Developed through diversified data curation, resampling, hybrid reinforcement learning, and high-performance training infrastructure.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to larger models in text and multimodal benchmarks, with superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B contributes to on-device MLLM research, offering insights and competitive performance with fewer parameters and data.

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

*Yucheng Sheng,Jiacheng Wang,Xingyu Zhou,Le Liang,Hao Ye,Shi Jin,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks is proposed, outperforming traditional DL methods in generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of mobile networks necessitates accurate prediction of key parameters like CSI and user location, but traditional DL methods lack generalization across scenarios.

Method: The model uses univariate decomposition, granularity encoding, a causal Transformer backbone, and patch masking for arbitrary input lengths.

Result: The model generalizes well to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance surpassing traditional baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model effectively addresses the limitations of traditional DL methods in wireless network predictions.

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Motivation: The opacity of AI in healthcare limits its interpretability and adoption, especially for lymphedema risk assessment post-radiotherapy in breast cancer.

Method: Statistical analysis of rule-based model attributes using Information Retrieval metrics to quantify relevance and explain risk factors.

Result: User study showed higher interpretability and usefulness compared to raw Explainable AI output.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances AI transparency for lymphedema risk prediction, aiding healthcare decision-making.

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HopeBot, an LLM-powered chatbot, effectively administers the PHQ-9 for depression screening, showing strong agreement with self-administered scores and high user trust and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static tools like PHQ-9 lack interactivity and adaptability, prompting the development of HopeBot to enhance user experience and scalability.

Method: HopeBot uses retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification to administer PHQ-9. A within-subject study with 132 participants compared self-administered and chatbot versions.

Result: Scores showed strong agreement (ICC=0.91). 71% of participants trusted the chatbot more, citing clearer structure and support. Mean ratings for comfort, clarity, and handling sensitive topics were high (7.4-8.4). 87.1% would reuse or recommend HopeBot.

Conclusion: Voice-based LLM chatbots like HopeBot are feasible, scalable, and low-burden adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

*Kushal Gajjar,Harshit Sikchi,Arpit Singh Gautam,Marc Hammons,Saurabh Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero, an RL-based framework, achieves state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL accuracy with a lightweight reward signal, outperforming larger models despite using a smaller backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Text-to-SQL accuracy for complex queries, especially with LLMs, remains challenging due to issues like intermediate supervision and hybrid pipelines.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with a lightweight reward signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance, avoiding complex reward shaping.

Result: Achieves top execution accuracy on benchmarks (Text2SQL, BIRD), outperforming larger models like SFT CodeS-7B and Mistral 123B.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalability and efficiency of RL-based Text-to-SQL, supported by released datasets for further research.

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FGNS improves XAI interpretability by selecting class-representative examples using feature importance, outperforming traditional k-NN in user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods lack clarity for non-experts, necessitating better interpretability tools.

Method: FGNS uses local and global feature importance to select neighbors, enhancing class-representative examples.

Result: FGNS improved non-experts' error identification and decision speed/accuracy in Kannada script classification.

Conclusion: FGNS advances human-aligned model assessment but needs further work to bridge explanation quality and trust.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

*Tommaso Flaminio,Lluis Godo,Ramón Pino Pérez,Lluis Subirana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Lockean belief sets, focusing on their closure under classical logic and minimal probabilistic updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of Lockean belief sets, particularly their lack of closure under classical logic, and propose a method for minimal belief revision.

Method: Provides two characterizations of belief sets closed under classical logic and introduces a probabilistic update approach for minimal revision.

Result: Shows how to deductively close a belief set with minimal changes, ensuring logical consistency.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the applicability of Lockean belief sets by addressing their logical closure and revision challenges.

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEVO enhances LLM performance in finance via multi-stage training (CPT, SFT, RL) and curated datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research applies LLM reasoning advances to finance, which requires domain-specific knowledge.

Method: FEVO uses CPT for domain knowledge, SFT for reasoning, and RL for integration, with high-quality datasets (FEVO-Train).

Result: FEVO-R32B outperforms larger and specialist models on five financial benchmarks.

Conclusion: FEVO validates the importance of domain knowledge and structured reasoning for LLMs in finance.

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

TL;DR: An AI-based framework combining LSTM, GA, and SHAP improves energy management in healthcare by outperforming traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, enhancing forecasting accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies and high costs in healthcare energy management due to fluctuating demands and inadequate traditional methods.

Method: Uses LSTM for time-series forecasting, GA for parameter optimization and load balancing, and SHAP for model transparency.

Result: LSTM achieves lower MAE (21.69) and RMSE (29.96) compared to Prophet and ARIMA, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The LSTM-GA-SHAP framework offers a scalable, efficient, and resilient solution for healthcare energy management, with potential for future real-time deployment and reinforcement learning integration.

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

*Sanidhya Vijayvargiya,Aditya Bharat Soni,Xuhui Zhou,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Nouha Dziri,Graham Neubig,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety is a modular framework for evaluating AI agent safety across real-world tools and tasks, revealing significant unsafe behaviors in prominent LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI agent safety are limited by simulated environments or narrow tasks, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The framework evaluates agents using real tools (e.g., web browsers, code execution) and supports 350+ multi-turn tasks, combining rule-based and LLM-as-judge assessments.

Result: Testing five LLMs showed unsafe behavior in 51.2% to 72.7% of safety-vulnerable tasks, indicating critical safety gaps.

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety highlights the need for stronger safeguards before deploying AI agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

### [39] [The Delta Learning Hypothesis: Preference Tuning on Weak Data can Yield Strong Gains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06187)
*Scott Geng,Hamish Ivison,Chun-Liang Li,Maarten Sap,Jerry Li,Ranjay Krishna,Pang Wei Koh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Delta learning hypothesis shows that paired preference data with weak individual points can outperform stronger supervision, enabling simpler and cheaper state-of-the-art post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving language models often relies on high-quality data, which is scarce. This work explores whether weak paired preference data can drive learning effectively.

Method: Formulated the delta learning hypothesis, validated it via controlled experiments and scaling (post-training 8B models on preference data from smaller models).

Result: Matched performance of Tulu 3 on an 11-benchmark suite, despite using weaker supervisors. Proved logistic regression supports delta learning.

Conclusion: Delta learning enables effective model improvement from weak paired data, offering a simpler and cheaper alternative to strong supervision.

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

*Clément Yvernes,Emilie Devijver,Marianne Clausel,Eric Gaussier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal abstractions—simplified causal diagrams—to address the challenge of identifying treatment effects in observational data without full causal knowledge. It introduces a hierarchy of identifiability criteria for causal queries within these abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational data often lacks fully specified causal diagrams, making treatment effect identification difficult. Causal abstractions offer a partial solution by simplifying causal information.

Method: The authors formalize causal abstractions as collections of causal diagrams and introduce identifiability criteria for causal queries within these collections. They organize these criteria into a hierarchical structure.

Result: A structured hierarchy of identifiability criteria is presented, clarifying what can be inferred under varying levels of causal knowledge. Examples and tools for reasoning about identifiability are provided.

Conclusion: The framework enhances understanding of causal identifiability in settings with incomplete causal knowledge, offering practical tools for analysis.

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Michael J. Curry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR) for text, optimizing alignment with human preferences while maintaining properness in scoring rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proper scoring rules for textual information elicitation may not align well with human preferences, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Designs ASR by minimizing mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g., human score).

Result: ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while retaining properness.

Conclusion: ASR effectively balances properness and human preference alignment in textual scoring rules.

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

### [42] [Rethinking Over-Smoothing in Graph Neural Networks: A Perspective from Anderson Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05263)
*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores over-smoothing in GNNs by comparing it to Anderson localization, introduces participation degree as a metric, and suggests reducing disorder to mitigate the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, which causes node representations to lose distinctiveness.

Method: Analyzes over-smoothing through the lens of Anderson localization, introduces participation degree, and proposes theoretical solutions.

Result: Identifies over-smoothing as akin to low-frequency mode expansion and high-frequency mode localization, suggesting disorder reduction as a remedy.

Conclusion: The study links GNN over-smoothing to Anderson localization and proposes theoretical insights for mitigating the issue.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

*Mustafa Kamal,Niyaz Bin Hashem,Robin Krambroeckers,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve transformer-based time series forecasting by refining exogenous inputs through whitening and global context awareness, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with redundancy in exogenous inputs and limited long-term dependency capture due to fixed look-back windows.

Method: Whitens exogenous inputs to reduce redundancy and enhances their awareness of long-term patterns without extending the look-back window.

Result: Outperforms 11 baseline models on four benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The method is a robust and effective alternative for integrating exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

TL;DR: A novel DNN compression method using XAI (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) to reduce model size by 64% with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are computationally expensive; XAI helps understand and compress them efficiently.

Method: Uses LRP to score weights, prunes negative/zero-score parameters, and applies mixed-precision quantization.

Result: 64% model size reduction and 42% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art XAI-based methods.

Conclusion: XAI-based compression effectively reduces DNN size without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

TL;DR: P-DivGNN is a physics-informed ML framework for reconstructing micro-scale stress fields using graph neural networks, incorporating physical constraints and periodic boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently predict local stress fields for fracture analysis and fatigue criteria, addressing computational challenges in multi-scale simulations.

Method: Uses a message-passing graph neural network on a periodic micro-structure graph, incorporating physical constraints for equilibrium and periodic boundary conditions.

Result: Achieves accurate local stress field predictions and significant computational speed-ups, especially in non-linear hyperelastic cases.

Conclusion: P-DivGNN is effective for large-scale applications, offering a faster alternative to FE simulations while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeVe introduces 'neural velocity' to dynamically adjust learning rate and stop training, reducing reliance on validation loss and held-out datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperparameter tuning relies heavily on validation loss, which requires a held-out dataset. NeVe aims to provide a more efficient alternative.

Method: NeVe measures neural velocity, the rate of change of neuron transfer functions, to guide learning rate adjustments and stop criteria, even using noise inputs.

Result: Neural velocity proves effective as a metric for optimizing training, reducing dependency on validation data.

Conclusion: Neural velocity is a promising metric for efficient neural network training, offering a dynamic alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven model using conditional graph neural networks (cGNN) is introduced to simulate soft tissue deformations and interaction forces in virtual environments, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft tissue simulation is crucial for medical applications but faces challenges due to high deformability and the need for precise force estimation.

Method: The proposed cGNN model uses surface points and force locations to predict deformations and forces, trained via transfer learning with mass-spring simulations and experimental data.

Result: The model predicts deformations with 0.35±0.03 mm error and forces with 0.37±0.05 N error, demonstrating high accuracy.

Conclusion: The data-driven approach offers a promising solution for soft tissue simulation, with potential applications beyond medical fields.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

*Marc Bara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First dataless neural network for RCPSP, transforming scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives for gradient-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend dataless neural networks to RCPSP, addressing a gap in literature.

Method: Uses smooth relaxations, automatic differentiation, and a dense time-grid representation for GPU parallelization.

Result: Implementation and experiments on PSPLIB benchmarks (J30, J60, J120) are ongoing.

Conclusion: Pioneers a dataless approach for RCPSP, with empirical results pending.

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

### [49] [Going Beyond Heuristics by Imposing Policy Improvement as a Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05328)
*Chi-Chang Lee,Zhang-Wei Hong,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEPO introduces a new method to leverage heuristic rewards in RL, focusing on policy improvement rather than policy invariance, reducing human effort and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for incorporating heuristic rewards in RL rely on policy invariance, which often fails to improve performance and wastes resources.

Method: HEPO (Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization) maximizes policy improvement instead of policy invariance, effectively using heuristics without reward hacking.

Result: HEPO outperforms benchmarks with well-engineered rewards and works well even with poorly designed heuristics, reducing human effort.

Conclusion: HEPO provides a practical and effective way to integrate heuristic rewards in RL, improving performance and reducing reliance on expert-designed rewards.

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

*Jeroen Audenaert,Daniel Muthukrishna,Paul F. Gregory,David W. Hogg,V. Ashley Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A foundation model for structured time series disentangles physical phenomena from instrumental distortions using a dual-encoder architecture and contrastive learning, improving generalization in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observations in time series data often mix true physical phenomena with instrumental distortions, limiting model generalization, especially in multi-instrument scenarios.

Method: The model uses a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning, leveraging observational triplets to separate latent representations of physical signals and instrument effects.

Result: Outperforms traditional single-latent space models on downstream tasks, especially in low-data regimes, as tested on simulated astronomical time series.

Conclusion: The model enhances few-shot generalization and adaptation, emphasizing the value of causal structure in representation learning for structured data.

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) in continual post-training (CPT) for multimodal models, finding RFT superior in knowledge retention and general capability preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of learning paradigms (SFT vs. RFT) on knowledge retention during CPT, as prior work overlooked this aspect.

Method: Comparative analysis of SFT and RFT on seven multimodal tasks using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with experiments and an instance filtering algorithm for RFT.

Result: RFT outperforms SFT in retaining prior knowledge and preserving general capabilities; implicit regularization in RFT is key.

Conclusion: RFT is a robust paradigm for CPT, with proposed improvements enhancing its stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the tightness of reachable sets in neural network verification while maintaining computational efficiency and probabilistic guarantees.

Method: Combines LiRPA-based over-approximation with a sampling-based method to estimate tight intermediate reachable sets.

Result: Improves robustness certificates by up to 3.31X and 2.26X, with high confidence (99%) in challenging cases.

Conclusion: PT-LiRPA offers a scalable and effective solution for neural network verification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{P}$robabilistically $\textbf{T}$ightened
$\textbf{Li}$near $\textbf{R}$elaxation-based $\textbf{P}$erturbation
$\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines
over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based
method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that
with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the
estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide
answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

TL;DR: AXLearn is a modular, high-performance deep learning system designed for scalable training of large models, with unique support for heterogeneous hardware and low code complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable and efficient deep learning systems that support rapid model development and experimentation on diverse hardware.

Method: AXLearn emphasizes modularity, strict encapsulation, and introduces a LoC-complexity metric to quantify modularity. It integrates features like RoPE with minimal code.

Result: AXLearn maintains constant complexity while scaling, requires significantly less code for feature integration, and matches state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: AXLearn successfully combines modularity, scalability, and performance, offering a practical solution for large-scale deep learning training.

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that
facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning
models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a
unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware
infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components
follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to
facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred
of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in
other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance
compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience
in the development and operation of AXLearn.

*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepLIn, a method to learn robust representations of causally-related latent variables by leveraging interventional data and enforcing independence conditions derived from the causal model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat interventional data like observational data, ignoring causal independence relations, leading to performance disparities. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes RepLIn, a training algorithm that enforces statistical independence during interventions, derived from theoretical conditions for linear models.

Result: RepLIn reduces error on interventional data, scales with causal graph complexity, and works for both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Conclusion: RepLIn effectively improves robustness against interventional distribution shifts, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural emissions contribute significantly to air pollution, but current physics-based models fail to capture complex pollutant interactions.

Method: Two novel deep learning architectures, EmissionNet (ENV) and EmissionNet-Transformer (ENT), use convolutional and transformer-based approaches to model spatial-temporal dependencies in emissions data.

Result: The proposed models effectively forecast N2O emissions by leveraging high-resolution data and advanced architectures.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures like ENV and ENT offer improved forecasting for agricultural emissions, surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: Air pollution from agricultural emissions is a significant yet often
overlooked contributor to environmental and public health challenges.
Traditional air quality forecasting models rely on physics-based approaches,

*Edward Raff,Karen Kukla,Michel Benaroch,Joseph Comprix*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVMO attacks, a method for financial fraud, showing firms can inflate earnings by 100-200% while reducing fraud scores by 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distressed firms manipulate financial reports for personal gain, leveraging existing frameworks and anti-correlated objectives.

Method: MVMO attacks adapt search direction to find more satisfying attacks, validated with lawyers and accountants.

Result: MVMO attacks yield 20x more satisfying results, enabling significant earnings inflation and fraud score reduction.

Conclusion: MVMO attacks are effective and realistic, posing a serious threat to financial reporting integrity.

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified distributional multi-step RL framework is introduced to tackle delayed/sparse rewards in games like 2048. Four agent variants (DQN, PPO, QR-DQN, H-DQN) are compared, with H-DQN achieving the best performance, reaching high scores and tiles (2048, 4096).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delayed and sparse rewards in RL, exemplified by the 2048 game, hinder agents from optimizing long-horizon performance.

Method: Developed and compared four RL agents (DQN, PPO, QR-DQN, H-DQN) using Gym-2048, with H-DQN integrating advanced techniques like distributional learning and prioritized replay.

Result: H-DQN outperformed others, achieving max scores of 18.21K (2048 tile) and 41.828K (4096 tile).

Conclusion: Distributional multi-step RL significantly improves performance in sparse-reward domains, with potential for further gains via model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using forward-backward (FB) representations for exploration in zero-shot reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot reinforcement learning lacks concrete rewards, and existing methods like FB decouple from exploration, relying on external algorithms. The paper argues FB should inherently guide exploration.

Method: Designs exploration policies from FB representations to minimize epistemic uncertainty by reducing posterior variance.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed exploration strategy significantly improves FB algorithm's sample complexity.

Conclusion: FB representations should be leveraged for exploration to enhance learning efficiency in zero-shot reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

*Andrew Jacobsen,Alessandro Rudi,Francesco Orabona,Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reduces dynamic regret minimization in online convex optimization to a static regret problem in a function space using RKHS, achieving optimal guarantees and practical computability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify dynamic regret minimization by framing it as a static regret problem in a function space, enabling broader applicability and optimal guarantees.

Method: Uses Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to transform dynamic regret into static regret, allowing for optimal and adaptive regret guarantees.

Result: Achieves optimal dynamic regret guarantees for linear losses and new bounds for exp-concave and improper linear regression settings.

Conclusion: The RKHS-based reduction is practical and effective, extending dynamic regret analysis beyond linear losses.

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

TL;DR: A novel training-free diffusion guidance framework, Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), unifies stochastic optimal control (SOC) and classifier-based methods, correcting approximate posteriors for reliable guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOC methods are computationally intensive, while training-free classifier-based approximations introduce errors, necessitating a unified and corrected approach.

Method: Proposes SDG, a training-free framework using a surrogate SOC objective and Stein variational inference to correct posterior approximations.

Result: SDG outperforms standard training-free methods in molecular generation tasks, demonstrating reliable guidance.

Conclusion: SDG offers a principled correction mechanism and effective guidance, showing promise for broader applications.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Conclusion: Ex-HiDeNN demonstrates superior performance in discovering closed-form expressions, with potential for future extensions despite current limitations.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To dynamically predict building occupancy and movement patterns without assuming occupant behavior or compromising privacy, leveraging Wi-Fi data and building schedules.

Method: Proposes a Graph Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) to model traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs, representing buildings as nodes and routes as edges in a graph.

Result: GCLSTM significantly outperforms traditional methods (MLP, Linear Regression) in predicting pedestrian flows.

Conclusion: The integrated GCLSTM model is effective for dynamic occupancy and movement prediction, offering interpretability and privacy preservation.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour

as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication overhead is a bottleneck in distributed learning, and existing gradient compression methods trade off empirical efficiency (biased) for theoretical guarantees (unbiased).

Method: Introduces a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that uses biased compressors to create unbiased estimates, applied to Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors. Includes an adaptive version for improved performance.

Result: The method effectively combines the strengths of biased and unbiased compressors, validated empirically on distributed deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: The MLMC scheme offers a versatile and efficient solution for gradient compression in distributed learning, bridging the gap between biased and unbiased methods.

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning-based treatment effect optimization method enhances user growth marketing by optimizing user selection and reward allocation, outperforming traditional methods by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User growth is critical for consumer internet companies, requiring cost-effective marketing strategies to maximize engagement.

Method: The approach uses deep learning to model uplifts in business metrics, employing softmax gating for joint parameter optimization in an aggregated loss function.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques like R-learner and Causal Forest by over 20%, proving cost-efficiency and real-world impact.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, applicable to various scenarios, and validated through successful global deployments.

Abstract: User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize
costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel
treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By
leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to
optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while
minimizing costs. Unlike traditional prediction methods, our model directly
models uplifts in key business metrics. Further, our deep learning model can
jointly optimize parameters for an aggregated loss function using softmax
gating. Our approach surpasses traditional methods by directly targeting
desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including
comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques such as R-learner and Causal
Forest, validate the effectiveness of our model. We experimentally demonstrate
that our proposed constrained and direct optimization algorithms significantly
outperform state-of-the-art methods by over $20\%$, proving their
cost-efficiency and real-world impact. The versatile methods can be applied to
various product scenarios, including optimal treatment allocation. Its

### [65] [Deep Learning of Continuous and Structured Policies for Aggregated Heterogeneous Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05511)
*Jennifer Y. Zhang,Shuyang Du,Will Y. Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) with structured treatment policies, incorporating multiple policy factors like continuous intensity and discrete assignments. It introduces a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer for ranking subjects using aggregated HTE functions, validated on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the expanding treatment action space in HTE estimation, moving beyond binary treatments to structured policies with multiple factors.

Method: The method involves deriving formulations for multiple treatment variables, developing a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework, and applying it to continuous/discrete treatments and ranking.

Result: The proposed framework improves performance, as demonstrated on public datasets.

Conclusion: The work presents a generic deep learning framework for HTE estimation with structured treatment policies, enhancing flexibility and performance.

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

### [66] [Estimating Interventional Distributions with Uncertain Causal Graphs through Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05526)
*Anish Dhir,Cristiana Diaconu,Valentinian Mihai Lungu,James Requeima,Richard E. Turner,Mark van der Wilk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MACE-TNP, a meta-learning model for Bayesian causal inference, addressing structural uncertainty in causal graphs and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many scientific questions involve estimating intervention effects, but observational data often support multiple causal structures, leading to overconfidence in single-structure methods.

Method: The authors propose MACE-TNP, an end-to-end meta-learning model that predicts Bayesian model-averaged interventional distributions, avoiding intractable computations.

Result: Empirically, MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines in handling structural uncertainty.

Conclusion: Meta-learning is a scalable and flexible approach for approximating Bayesian causal inference, with potential for future applications in complex settings.

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

### [67] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning with InterpoLated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05527)
*Michalis Korakakis,Andreas Vlachos,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) mitigates shortcut reliance in models by interpolating representations of majority and minority examples, improving generalization without sacrificing majority accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) leads models to exploit spurious correlations, hindering generalization on minority examples. Existing methods are limited in scope and effectiveness.

Method: InterpoLL interpolates representations of majority examples with features from minority examples to weaken shortcut influence.

Result: InterpoLL outperforms ERM and state-of-the-art methods in minority generalization across various architectures, maintaining majority accuracy.

Conclusion: InterpoLL is a broadly applicable solution for improving model generalization by mitigating shortcut reliance.

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

*Sanaz Kazemi Abharian,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates hardware-based fault attacks on GNNs, proposing GBFA, a layer-aware bit-flip attack that degrades model performance with minimal bit flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware accelerators for GNNs overlook security vulnerabilities, prompting the study of fault attacks on trained weights.

Method: GBFA uses a Markov model to predict layer execution and gradient ranking to identify vulnerable bits, flipping them gradually.

Result: GBFA significantly reduces GNN accuracy, e.g., degrading GraphSAGE by 17% with one bit flip in the last layer.

Conclusion: Layer-aware attacks like GBFA highlight critical security vulnerabilities in GNN hardware implementations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

### [69] [Theoretical Learning Performance of Graph Neural Networks: The Impact of Jumping Connections and Layer-wise Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05533)
*Jiawei Sun,Hongkang Li,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the generalization guarantees of GCNs with jumping connections and graph sparsification, showing that sparsification maintains performance if essential edges are preserved and revealing layer-specific sparsification needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in theoretical understanding of GCNs with jumping connections and graph sparsification, as existing analyses overlook one or both aspects.

Method: Theoretical analysis of learning dynamics and generalization in GCNs using graph sparsification and jumping connections, validated on benchmark datasets.

Result: Generalization accuracy approximates the highest achievable accuracy when the sparse adjacency matrix preserves essential edges. Jumping connections introduce layer-specific sparsification requirements.

Conclusion: Graph sparsification maintains generalization if key edges are preserved, and jumping connections affect sparsification needs differently across layers, validated empirically.

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSC-GNN improves GNN performance on noisy graphs by using external clean links and penalizing discrepancies between embeddings from full and regularization graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with noisy edges, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications with imperfect data.

Method: Train two encoders—one on the full graph (including external edges) and another on a regularization graph (excluding noisy target edges)—and penalize latent representation discrepancies.

Result: LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs on benchmark datasets with moderate noise and works well on heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: LSC-GNN enhances predictive performance and interpretability in noisy relational settings, validated on protein-metabolite networks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

*Jingyi Gao,Sol Lim,Seokhyun Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning framework for ergonomic risk assessment, improving load estimation from gait data by incorporating auxiliary information like baseline gait and carrying style, without needing manual labels at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for load estimation from gait data lack generalization and accuracy due to reliance on direct mappings. The study aims to enhance this by integrating auxiliary information.

Method: The framework uses deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks and bi-directional cross-attention to fuse loaded and unloaded gait patterns, eliminating the need for carrying style labels during inference.

Result: Experiments with real-world data show significant accuracy improvements from incorporating auxiliary information and effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances load estimation accuracy by leveraging auxiliary gait data and advanced fusion techniques, without requiring manual labels during deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multitask Preplay is a novel algorithm that uses experience on one task to simulate and learn solutions for other accessible but unpursued tasks, improving generalization and performance in multitask environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans leverage experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions for other tasks, even if not pursued. This study aims to formalize and replicate this ability in artificial agents.

Method: The Multitask Preplay algorithm replays experience on one task to simulate and learn solutions for unpursued tasks, creating predictive representations for adaptive performance.

Result: Multitask Preplay outperforms traditional methods in predicting human generalization and improves artificial agents' performance in novel environments like Craftax.

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory for human-like counterfactual learning and enhances artificial agents' multitask performance.

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training

risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,

in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

TL;DR: A model-free reinforcement learning approach using PPO is introduced for in situ training of diffractive optical processors, improving convergence and performance without needing system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in optimizing diffractive optical networks due to hardware imperfections and inefficient data use in existing methods.

Method: Utilizes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for in situ training, reusing measurement data and constraining policy updates for stability.

Result: Validated experimentally, showing better convergence and performance in tasks like energy focusing, holography, aberration correction, and image classification.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable framework for optical systems, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge and improving training under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Motivation: Reward hacking in RL systems threatens autonomous agent deployment, yet systematic detection and mitigation approaches are limited.

Method: Empirical study across diverse RL environments and algorithms, implementing automated detection for six reward hacking categories.

Result: Detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7% recall; mitigation reduces hacking by up to 54.6%.

Conclusion: Reward function properties significantly impact hacking frequency; mitigation is challenging due to practical trade-offs. Tools are publicly available for reproducible RL safety research.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Result: FACT is empirically validated, and FACT-RFM shows high performance on tabular data, capturing behaviors like grokking and phase transitions.

Conclusion: The FACT theorem provides insights into feature learning in neural networks, and FACT-RFM offers a practical algorithm with demonstrated effectiveness.

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

*Netta Palez,Léonie Straß,Sebastian Meller,Holger Volk,Anna Zamansky,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using wearable inertial sensors achieved high accuracy in classifying canine gait abnormalities, aiding in distinguishing between orthopedic and neurological conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating neurological and orthopedic gait impairments is challenging for clinicians; this study aims to provide an objective diagnostic tool using inertial sensors and deep learning.

Method: Developed a deep learning model using inertial sensor data from 29 dogs, optimizing performance and generalizability for multiclass (healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and binary (healthy/non-healthy) classification tasks.

Result: Achieved 96% accuracy in multiclass classification and 82% accuracy in binary classification when generalizing to unseen dogs.

Conclusion: Inertial-based deep learning models show promise as practical and objective aids for gait assessment in veterinary clinical settings.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

TL;DR: ABench-Physics is introduced to evaluate LLMs' physical reasoning, revealing gaps in their capabilities, especially in dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in physics are limited, lacking depth and dynamic evaluation, necessitating a more rigorous benchmark.

Method: ABench-Physics includes static (Phy_A) and dynamic (Phy_B) problem sets, testing precision and robustness under varying conditions.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance gaps, particularly in handling dynamic variants.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics offers a diagnostic tool to advance LLMs' scientific reasoning, highlighting current limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for scalable, privacy-preserving AI training, addressing challenges in client-expert alignment and load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient training of large-scale AI models on decentralized data while preserving privacy, overcoming system-level challenges in FL and MoE integration.

Method: Proposes a system design with dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling for intelligent client-expert alignment.

Result: A scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanism with fewer communication rounds for convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed design paves the way for deploying large-scale federated MoE-structured models in edge computing with high communication efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoTriton is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based model for optimizing Triton programming, achieving performance comparable to mainstream large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of critical parameters in Triton programming is time-consuming and limits optimal performance. AutoTriton aims to automate this process.

Method: AutoTriton uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), combining rule-based and execution-based rewards.

Result: AutoTriton matches performance of models like Claude-4-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1-0528, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AutoTriton demonstrates RL's potential for automating high-performance kernel generation, advancing efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

TL;DR: MobileGUI-RL is a scalable framework for training GUI agents online, addressing limitations of offline methods by using self-exploration and GRPO adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents trained offline suffer from scalability issues, overfitting, and brittleness in unseen environments.

Method: MobileGUI-RL synthesizes tasks via self-exploration and adapts GRPO with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards.

Result: Experiments on mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent performance gains.

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL effectively trains GUI agents online, improving scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-layer UAV-assisted edge computing architecture for vehicular networks, optimizing delay and energy consumption using a hierarchical offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies lack coordination of heterogeneous resources and adaptability to dynamic network conditions in vehicular edge computing.

Method: A dual-layer architecture with high-altitude UAVs for relay and low-altitude UAVs for computing. A joint optimization problem is solved via a Markov decision process and a hierarchical offloading scheme using the soft actor-critic algorithm.

Result: Simulations show the approach outperforms baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and convergence speed, proving robust in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture and method effectively integrate heterogeneous resources and adapt to dynamic conditions, enhancing vehicular edge computing performance.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate high-resolution atmospheric modeling demands large neural networks, but memory and I/O-bandwidth bottlenecks hinder training.

Method: Introduces WeatherMixer for linear workload scaling and Jigsaw for efficient model parallelization using domain and tensor parallelism.

Result: Achieves 9-11 PFLOPs peak performance, 23-28% of theoretical peaks, and 68-72% scaling efficiency on 256 GPUs.

Conclusion: WeatherMixer and Jigsaw enable efficient, high-performance training of large-scale weather models, overcoming computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

TL;DR: A deep learning and physics-informed method for cardiac disease diagnosis achieves high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac diseases require accurate diagnostics; this study aims to improve diagnosis by combining deep learning with biomechanical modeling.

Method: Deep learning image registration with physics-informed regularization, using Neo-Hookean material model, and feature extraction for disease classification.

Result: Achieved high Dice scores (up to 0.945) and classification accuracy (98-100%) on the ACDC dataset.

Conclusion: The method enhances diagnostic accuracy and explainability, supporting personalized cardiac care.

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prediction methods assume static vertices, limiting their applicability to dynamic processes like telecommunication and transport networks.

Method: Combines time series prediction with an adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA) to handle growing graphs and vertex changes.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic (Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) show the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing methods and proves effective for dynamic graph prediction.

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

*Marco Roschkowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soup-Adapter, a method for few-shot domain adaptation in foundation models, addressing hyperparameter tuning and robustness under distribution shifts by averaging outputs of multiple independently trained adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of hyperparameter tuning without large validation datasets and ensuring model robustness under slight distribution shifts motivate the need for a more effective adaptation method.

Method: The method involves training multiple independent adapters with diverse hyperparameters, averaging their outputs to improve performance and robustness, and reparameterizing the ensemble into a single adapter (Soup-Adapter).

Result: The ensemble outperforms individual adapters, showing higher performance and robustness to distribution shifts, while being less sensitive to critical hyperparameters like the residual ratio.

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter effectively addresses hyperparameter tuning and robustness issues in few-shot domain adaptation, demonstrating its applicability to models like CLIP and DINOv2.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend local interpretability methods into global mechanistic interpretability, enabling deeper understanding of model behavior, concept interactions, and bias analysis.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic framework to quantify concept representation across layers, identifying latent circuits and information flow, visualized through the BAGEL knowledge graph.

Result: BAGEL provides structured insights into concept-class relationships, spurious correlations, and model trustworthiness, scalable across models.

Conclusion: The framework advances interpretability by revealing global model behavior and biases, aiding in understanding generalization and failure modes.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairDG, addressing domain generalization and fairness in machine learning, proposing PAFDG for optimal utility-fairness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between domain generalization and algorithmic fairness, as current methods treat them separately.

Method: Derives mutual information-based bounds for risk and fairness, then introduces PAFDG for Pareto-optimal solutions.

Result: PAFDG outperforms existing methods in utility-fairness trade-offs on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FairDG and PAFDG effectively combine domain generalization and fairness, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

TL;DR: A federated learning framework using prototypes and lightweight adapters to reduce communication overhead and address statistical heterogeneity while providing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in federated learning, such as communication overhead and statistical heterogeneity, while ensuring privacy and interpretability.

Method: Uses prototypes and lightweight adapter modules to guide clients, replacing full model weight transfers with these compressed surrogates.

Result: Improved accuracy in classification tasks on a retinal fundus image dataset, with inherent interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces communication load, addresses heterogeneity, and provides interpretability, outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Result: Achieves 83% higher accuracy on unseen data and 65% better performance on new datasets; 93% more accurate during cyber-attacks.

Conclusion: PINNs significantly enhance power system state estimation, offering improved accuracy and robustness, especially in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into
the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for
transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while
also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data
manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

TL;DR: A novel framework for task-independent embeddings of tabular data using graph structures and Graph Auto-Encoders, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data in relational databases is widely used but lacks predefined tasks, necessitating universal embeddings for flexible downstream applications.

Method: Transform tabular data into a graph, use Graph Auto-Encoders for entity embeddings, and aggregate them into row embeddings for task-independent use.

Result: Superior performance in downstream tasks like regression, classification, and outlier detection compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective, universal embeddings for tabular data, enabling flexible and efficient downstream task performance.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Result: Feature-based methods excel in high-fidelity motion imitation but struggle with generalization; GAN-based methods offer flexibility but face training instability.

Conclusion: The choice between paradigms depends on task-specific priorities (fidelity, diversity, etc.), with no clear dominance of one over the other.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

### [95] [Diffusion Dataset Condensation: Training Your Diffusion Model Faster with Less Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05914)
*Rui Huang,Shitong Shao,Zikai Zhou,Pukun Zhao,Hangyu Guo,Tian Ye,Lichen Bai,Shuo Yang,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C), a method to reduce the resource-intensive training of diffusion models by creating a synthetic sub-dataset with fewer samples, achieving high-quality training with lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion models is resource-heavy, requiring millions of images and extensive GPU time. The paper aims to address this by condensing datasets for efficient training.

Method: Proposes D2C with two phases: Select (identifies a compact, diverse subset using diffusion difficulty scores and interval sampling) and Attach (enhances the subset with rich semantic and visual representations).

Result: D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up for SiT-XL/2, reaching a FID score of 4.3 in 40k steps with only 0.8% of the original data.

Conclusion: D2C effectively reduces training costs for diffusion models while maintaining high visual quality, making it a practical solution for resource-efficient training.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses label noise in veterinary AI by using multiple expert opinions to reduce noise in canine heart sound data, improving classification accuracy, especially with XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in veterinary AI training data, particularly for canine heart murmur detection, negatively impacts model performance.

Method: A dataset of 140 heart sound recordings was annotated by experts, with 70 high-quality recordings selected. Three algorithms (AdaBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest) were trained and evaluated.

Result: XGBoost showed the highest improvement in accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity increased significantly across all murmur intensity categories after noise reduction.

Conclusion: Reducing label noise is crucial for improving AI classification of canine heart murmurs, with XGBoost performing best.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart
sound classification, label noise reduction, machine learning, XGBoost,

### [97] [Simple Convergence Proof of Adam From a Sign-like Descent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05966)
*Hanyang Peng,Shuang Qin,Yue Yu,Fangqing Jiang,Hui Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel interpretation of Adam as a sign-like optimizer, simplifying its convergence analysis and proving an optimal convergence rate under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical analyses of Adam are complex and rely on strong assumptions, making them difficult to verify and extend. The paper aims to provide a simpler and more intuitive understanding of Adam's convergence.

Method: The authors reinterpret Adam as a sign-like optimizer, reformulating its update rule to simplify the analysis. They prove convergence under mild conditions, such as generalized p-affine variance and (L0, L1, q)-smoothness.

Result: The paper demonstrates that Adam achieves an optimal convergence rate of O(1/T^(1/4)), improving upon previous results. It also highlights the role of momentum in ensuring convergence and offers practical tuning guidelines.

Conclusion: The proposed sign-like interpretation of Adam simplifies its theoretical analysis, provides stronger convergence guarantees, and bridges the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

*Julia Pelzer,Corné Verburg,Alexander Heinlein,Miriam Schulte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN) is proposed to address challenges in modeling groundwater flow with heat transport, combining lightweight numerical surrogates and CNNs for efficient and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles with limited or low-quality data in real-world applications like groundwater flow with heat transport, where classical simulations are costly and purely data-driven models fail in predicting advection.

Method: The LGCNN combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for global transport with CNNs for local groundwater velocity and heat diffusion, tested on synthetic and real-world subsurface data.

Result: The model successfully scales to larger cut-outs without retraining, handling heterogeneous flow fields and multiple heat sources.

Conclusion: The LGCNN offers a computationally efficient and accurate solution for modeling complex subsurface processes, with published datasets and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in exploring QAT's impact on SSMs for specialized edge hardware like AIMC chips.

Method: Apply quantization-aware training (QAT) to SSMs, analyze model size vs. precision, and integrate techniques for deployment on AIMC.

Result: QAT reduces SSM complexity by up to 100x, enhances robustness to noise, and enables structural pruning.

Conclusion: QAT optimizes SSMs for edge hardware, improving computational efficiency on AIMC substrates.

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

TL;DR: CoRE enables label-free self-evaluation in large reasoning models to reduce redundant reasoning steps, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overthinking in LRMs by enabling autonomous correctness assessment of reasoning steps without external labels.

Method: Introduce Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding (CoRE) and CoRE-Eval, a framework analyzing geometric properties of reasoning trajectories to detect redundancy.

Result: Reduces reasoning steps by 13.7-33.2% and improves accuracy by ~10%, achieving 70% accuracy on AIME with a 32B model.

Conclusion: CoRE-Eval enhances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in LRMs by dynamically terminating redundant reasoning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

TL;DR: UARL is a safe RL framework that avoids direct target domain interaction by using uncertainty-aware training and progressive randomization for robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and impracticality of direct RL policy refinement in real-world deployments due to distribution shifts and OOD challenges.

Method: Uses ensemble critics for uncertainty quantification and progressive environmental randomization in simulated training.

Result: Effective OOD detection, improved performance, and sample efficiency in MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: UARL safely enhances RL policy robustness without target domain interaction, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO-SAH is a zeroth-order optimization method that uses subspace-based Hessian approximation to reduce function-query costs, outperforming existing methods in convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-free optimization is needed when gradients are inaccessible, but existing methods lack efficiency due to high costs of Hessian estimation.

Method: ZO-SAH approximates Hessians in randomly selected 2D subspaces by fitting quadratic polynomials and reuses evaluations via periodic subspace-switching.

Result: ZO-SAH achieves faster convergence than other zeroth-order methods on tasks like logistic regression and deep neural network training.

Conclusion: ZO-SAH effectively balances cost and performance, making it a practical choice for gradient-free optimization.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework for inferring hidden associations in scientific literature networks, combining matrix factorization methods to reveal novel cross-disciplinary hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature networks are large, sparse, and noisy, often missing links between entities. The goal is to uncover hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk), Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk), and Logistic Matrix Factorization (LMF) to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).

Result: The framework successfully predicts missing links, such as associations with superconducting TMD clusters, and highlights novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration.

Conclusion: The method effectively uncovers hidden connections in scientific literature, aiding discovery in diverse corpora, and is supported by an interactive dashboard for human-in-the-loop exploration.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, proposes frame-theoretic methods to characterize Parseval stability, and derives efficient optimization objectives to suppress aliasing. It also provides closed-form expressions for aliasing effects in random kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aliasing in convolutional layers affects numerical stability and generalization, but a general analysis of its effects on stability is lacking.

Method: A frame-theoretic approach is used to analyze aliasing in 1D convolutional layers, leading to stability bounds and Parseval stability characterizations. Two optimization objectives are derived to suppress aliasing.

Result: Practical stability bounds are provided, and closed-form expressions for aliasing effects in random kernels are derived, offering insights into initialization behavior.

Conclusion: The study offers a systematic way to analyze and mitigate aliasing in convolutional layers, enhancing stability and generalization.

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance of LGNs by optimizing connections and reducing the number of required logic gates.

Method: Uses a probability distribution to select high-merit connections per gate input, followed by gate-type selection.

the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

*Nadav Schneider,Itamar Zimerman,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting differential design techniques from Transformers to Mamba, a selective state-space architecture, to mitigate attention overallocation issues. A novel differential mechanism for Mamba is introduced, improving retrieval and performance over vanilla Mamba.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to irrelevant context, degrading capabilities like retrieval and robustness. The paper investigates if differential design, effective in Transformers, can benefit Mamba.

Method: The authors adapt differential design to Mamba, requiring architectural modifications. They introduce a novel differential mechanism for Mamba and validate it on language modeling benchmarks.

Result: The proposed approach improves retrieval capabilities and outperforms vanilla Mamba, effectively mitigating attention overallocation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that differential design can be successfully adapted to Mamba with careful modifications, enhancing its performance and addressing attention-related issues.

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Result: Simulations show the proposed neural network models are effective and robust in optimizing antenna activation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenge of dynamically controlling pinching antennas in waveguides, demonstrating practical viability.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

### [113] [Structured Captions Improve Prompt Adherence in Text-to-Image Models (Re-LAION-Caption 19M)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05300)
*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Structured captions improve text-to-image model alignment by enforcing a four-part template during training, outperforming shuffled captions in text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative text-to-image models struggle with prompt adherence due to noisy datasets, requiring extensive prompt engineering.

Method: Proposed Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a dataset with structured captions (subject, setting, aesthetics, camera details), and fine-tuned PixArt-Σ and Stable Diffusion 2.

Result: Structured captions yielded higher text-image alignment scores compared to shuffled captions, as measured by VQA models.

Conclusion: Enforcing caption structure during training enhances model controllability and alignment, reducing reliance on prompt engineering.

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorrDetail is a visual detail-enhanced self-correction framework for interpretable deepfake detection, addressing limitations of existing methods by improving forgery detail accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of facial deepfakes demands effective detection methods. Current visual-based and multimodal approaches have flaws: unclear forgery details and hallucination issues.

Method: CorrDetail uses error-guided questioning to correct forgery details, includes a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module, and employs a fusion decision strategy for better performance.

Result: CorrDetail outperforms state-of-the-art methods, accurately identifies forged details, and shows strong generalization.

Conclusion: CorrDetail offers a reliable and interpretable solution for deepfake detection, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual staining methods treat all pixels equally, reproducing noise and artifacts instead of focusing on relevant cellular structures.

Method: Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss and applies Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware learning.

Result: Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological representation while maintaining pixel-level accuracy.

Conclusion: Spotlight produces virtual stains better suited for downstream tasks like segmentation and profiling.

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing food security challenges by leveraging foundation models for agricultural monitoring, given their under-explored potential in agriculture-specific tasks.

Method: Quantitative evaluation of existing foundational models, development of a requirements framework (CropFM), and empirical evaluation of two models in three agricultural tasks.

Result: Existing models show potential but lack specialization for agriculture, underscoring the need for a dedicated foundational model.

Conclusion: A tailored foundational model (CropFM) is essential for effective agricultural monitoring and addressing food security challenges.

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater image quality by incorporating human subjective assessments into deep learning models.

Method: Train a classifier to distinguish image quality, then use GANs with enhancement criteria (color fidelity, sharpness) to refine low-quality images.

Result: The model improves both perceived and measured image quality, validated by metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM.

Conclusion: Incorporating human assessments and specific criteria into GANs effectively enhances underwater image quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pFedMMA is a personalized federated learning framework using multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks, balancing personalization and generalization efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP to decentralized, heterogeneous data without sacrificing generalization is challenging.

Method: Uses multi-modal adapters with modality-specific layers and a shared global projection, optimized asymmetrically for local adaptation and global alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization across eleven datasets, outperforming federated prompt tuning methods.

Conclusion: pFedMMA effectively balances personalization and generalization in federated learning for vision-language tasks, with efficient communication.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code

TL;DR: LoongX is a hands-free image editing system using neurophysiological signals (EEG, fNIRS, PPG) and diffusion models, achieving performance comparable to text-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image editing is labor-intensive and inaccessible for some users. LoongX aims to make it intuitive and accessible via brain-computer interfaces.

Method: LoongX integrates cross-scale state space (CS3) and dynamic gated fusion (DGF) modules to process heterogeneous neuro signals, aligning them with edit semantics using diffusion transformers (DiT).

Result: LoongX matches text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558) and outperforms them when combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

Conclusion: LoongX demonstrates the potential of neural-driven models for accessible image editing and cognitive-driven creative technologies.

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

*Lanqing Guo,Yufei Wang,Hezhen Hu,Yan Zheng,Yeying Jin,Siyu Huang,Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for precise local editing in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leveraging 2D diffusion for accurate region identification and inverse rendering for 3D localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D semantic parsing underperforms compared to 2D, making targeted 3D edits difficult. The paper aims to enhance control and fidelity in local scene editing.

Method: Uses 2D diffusion editing for region identification, inverse rendering for 3D localization, and refines views iteratively with depth maps from a 2D foundation model to ensure coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 4× speedup, enabling efficient and effective local 3D scene editing.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves 3D scene editing by combining 2D and 3D techniques, offering better control and efficiency.

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Conclusion: OpenWorldSAM effectively grounds language semantics into spatial masks, excelling in diverse segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for selective herbicide application using real-time AI. Future work will expand weed detection and validate in field trials.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision

where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

*Md Zahid Hasan,Guillermo Basulto-Elias,Jun Ha Chang,Sahuna Hallmark,Matthew Rizzo,Anuj Sharma,Soumik Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to detect cognitive decline in older drivers by analyzing driving behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods for cognitive decline (AD/MCI) are time-consuming and costly, leading to underdiagnosis. Real-world driving behavior offers a scalable, non-invasive alternative.

Method: Leverages large vision models to analyze naturalistic driving videos, extracting behavioral patterns ('digital fingerprints') linked to cognitive status and disease progression.

Result: Identifies early warning signs of cognitive impairment, enabling proactive interventions.

Conclusion: The approach enhances early detection of cognitive decline, offering a scalable, non-invasive monitoring system to reduce societal and economic burdens.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

### [126] [Cloud Diffusion Part 1: Theory and Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05496)
*Andrew Randono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing white noise in diffusion models with scale-invariant noise profiles ("Cloud Diffusion Models") to better match natural image statistics, aiming for faster inference, better details, and more control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural images exhibit scale-invariant statistical properties, unlike the white noise used in current diffusion models, suggesting a mismatch that could be improved.

Method: Introduce scale-invariant noise profiles (power-law scaling) into diffusion models instead of white noise, creating "Cloud Diffusion Models."

Result: Expected benefits include faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and enhanced controllability.

Conclusion: The proposed Cloud Diffusion Model could outperform traditional white noise-based models, with a follow-up study planned for validation.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

*Giulio Federico,Fabio Carrara,Claudio Gennaro,Giuseppe Amato,Marco Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet is a multi-view diffusion architecture that generates consistent multi-view images from a single input, improving 3D reconstruction quality by leveraging a shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of spatial inconsistency in multi-view image generation, which degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction.

Method: Uses a diffusion model applied in parallel across views, fuses encodings from all views into aggregated planes, and processes these to ensure coherence.

Result: Generates 16 high-quality, coherent views in 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in image quality and reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: LoomNet effectively produces diverse, plausible novel views, enhancing multi-view consistency and 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the demand for cross-modal retrieval systems.

Method: Modifies NVIDIA Eagle2 VLM with bidirectional attention and ColBERT-style late interaction, using a two-stage training strategy.

Result: Achieves NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, leading benchmarks as of June 2025.

Conclusion: The model excels in retrieval accuracy but faces trade-offs in storage and efficiency.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across
modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image
retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves
state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of autonomous vehicle datasets from Africa's diverse roads hinders robust perception in low-resource settings.

Method: Procedural augmentation pipeline with refractive (lens distortion, noise, warps) and weather (fog, lens flare) modules. Evaluated using three image restoration models.

Result: Released toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and benchmark results to support perception research without costly data collection.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a practical solution for enhancing perception research in underrepresented African contexts.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,
particularly across Africa's diverse urban, rural, and unpaved roads, remains a
key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a
procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam
footage with realistic refractive distortions and weather-induced artifacts
tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free
(incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous
fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

*Jiaxu Tian,Xuehui Yu,Yaoxing Wang,Pan Wang,Guangqian Guo,Shan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReLayout improves content-aware layout generation by using relation-CoT to interpret spatial relationships and a rebalance sampler to address diversity issues, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based layout methods struggle with interpreting spatial relationships, leading to structural and diversity problems in generated layouts.

Method: ReLayout introduces relation-CoT for explicit spatial relationship definitions and a layout prototype rebalance sampler to enhance diversity and structure.

Result: ReLayout generates more structured, diverse, and aesthetically coherent layouts, verified by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ReLayout addresses limitations of current methods, producing layouts better aligned with human aesthetics and explainability.

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CTNet improves multi-modal face anti-spoofing by leveraging consistent cross-modal feature transitions for live samples and inconsistent transitions for spoof detection, even with missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal FAS faces distribution discrepancies and missing modalities during inference. Live faces show smaller visual differences and more consistent cross-modal transitions than spoof faces.

Method: CTNet learns consistent cross-modal feature transitions for live samples and inconsistent transitions for spoof detection. It also learns complementary IR and depth features from RGB to handle missing modalities.

Result: CTNet outperforms previous multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Conclusion: CTNet effectively addresses multi-modal FAS challenges by leveraging cross-modal transitions and handling missing modalities, enhancing robustness.

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

*Shuai Li,Shihan Chen,Wanru Geng,Zhaohua Xu,Xiaolu Liu,Can Dong,Zhen Tian,Changlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised defect detection framework (DSYM) using conditional diffusion and pseudo-labeling improves data efficiency and accuracy in industrial quality inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defect detection methods are inefficient and costly, prompting the need for a robust, low-labeling-dependent solution.

Method: DSYM employs a two-stage collaborative training mechanism, pseudo-labeling, and conditional diffusion for multi-scale defect synthesis, with CLIP-based noise filtering.

Result: Achieves 78.4% mAP@0.5 with full labeled data and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% labeled data, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: DSYM offers a high-precision, efficient solution for industrial defect detection, reducing reliance on labeled data.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

*Zhizhuo Pang,Zhihui Ke,Xiaobo Zhou,Tie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSVR introduces a 2D Gaussian-based video representation for fast decoding (800+ FPS) and efficient training (2s/frame), addressing slow computation and training in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit neural video representations focus on quality but neglect decoding speed and training efficiency, hindered by high computational costs.

Method: GSVR uses a hybrid deformation field (tri-plane and polynomial motion) and Dynamic-aware Time Slicing for motion handling. It includes quantization-aware fine-tuning and Gaussian compression.

Result: Achieves 800+ FPS, 35+ PSNR, and faster convergence (2s/frame training). Outperforms in decoding speed (10x faster) and compression vs. NeRV.

Conclusion: GSVR offers a fast, efficient, and high-quality video representation, suitable for interpolation and compression tasks.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: Accordion is a framework converting AI-generated pixel designs into editable layered designs, refining nonsensical text with user prompts, using a vision language model and expert tools like SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated designs lack editability, but inspire human designers. Accordion bridges this gap by transforming non-layered AI designs into editable layered ones.

Method: Uses a vision language model in three stages, guided by prompts, and leverages tools like SAM for layer decomposition. Trained on Design39K with AI-augmented data.

Result: Outperforms on DesignIntention benchmark (text-to-template, text addition, de-rendering) and excels in design variations, validated by user studies.

Conclusion: Accordion successfully converts AI designs into editable layers, enhancing usability and creativity in graphic design workflows.

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kernel Density Steering (KDS) improves diffusion models for image restoration by using an ensemble of samples to guide outputs toward high-fidelity regions, reducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image restoration often produce inconsistent fidelity and artifacts, prompting the need for a more robust method.

Method: KDS employs an N-particle ensemble to compute patch-wise kernel density gradients, steering samples toward shared high-density regions for better fidelity.

Result: KDS enhances quantitative and qualitative performance in super-resolution and inpainting tasks without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: KDS offers a plug-and-play solution to improve diffusion models' robustness and fidelity in image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes GenHMC, a generative method for photorealistic avatar animations in VR/AR, using unpaired HMC captures to generate synthetic HMC images, improving ground truth accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in obtaining ground truth facial states for VR/AR avatars due to partial observations from HMC and expensive paired data collection.

Method: Introduces Generative HMC (GenHMC), leveraging unpaired HMC captures to generate synthetic HMC images conditioned on dome capture avatar states.

Result: Achieves better disentanglement of facial expression and appearance, generalizes to unseen identities, and improves data efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: GenHMC enables scalable, high-quality avatar animations without relying on paired captures, advancing VR/AR realism.

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

*Suoxiang Zhang,Xiaxi Li,Hongrui Chang,Zhuoyan Hou,Guoxin Wu,Ronghua Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptaGen is a hierarchical semantic optimization framework for domain-specific image generation, addressing limitations in prompt engineering and semantic constraints to improve quality and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to integrate semantic understanding with visual representation and lack domain-specific constraints, leading to hallucinations and deviations.

Method: AdaptaGen combines matrix-based prompt optimization, multi-perspective understanding, cross-modal adaptation, and two-phase caption semantic transformation.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, achieving high image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency with minimal training data.

Conclusion: AdaptaGen effectively addresses domain-specific image generation challenges, offering improved performance and semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

Result: OFFSET outperforms on four benchmark datasets, reducing noise interference and enhancing modification focus perception.

Conclusion: OFFSET effectively addresses CIR limitations, improving retrieval accuracy by focusing on dominant portions and leveraging textual guidance.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The

### [140] [Knowledge-guided Complex Diffusion Model for PolSAR Image Classification in Contourlet Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05666)
*Junfei Shi,Yu Cheng,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Zhaolin Xiao,Maoguo Gong,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model using Contourlet transform improves PolSAR image classification by preserving phase information and fine structural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional real-valued diffusion models fail to capture complex-valued phase information and fine structural details in PolSAR data.

Method: Uses Contourlet transform to decompose data, models low-frequency components with a complex diffusion network, and guides diffusion with high-frequency structural information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in edge preservation and region homogeneity on three PolSAR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of traditional diffusion models for PolSAR data, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

### [141] [Dynamic Rank Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05668)
*Jiahui Wang,Qin Xu,Bo Jiang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a method to improve generalization in vision-language models by dynamically adjusting feature ranks based on token importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fine-tuning VLMs struggle with maintaining generalization for unseen classes due to equal treatment of all tokens, leading to overfitting on less informative features.

Method: DRA uses token importance grouping and dynamic rank adaptation, prioritizing important tokens and channels, and includes L1 regularization for stability.

Result: DRA outperforms existing methods, especially in enhancing performance for new classes across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DRA effectively preserves general knowledge and improves generalization, making it superior for unseen class recognition.

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

*Omar Zamzam,Haleh Akrami,Anand Joshi,Richard Leahy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model-based framework is introduced to segment, reverse deformations, and inpaint brain lesions, improving accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lesion segmentation methods fail to distinguish between damaged and deformed brain tissue, limiting clinical and research applications.

Method: The framework segments lesions, reverses tissue deformations, isolates core damage, and inpaints to estimate pre-lesion healthy brain.

Result: Improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust tool for brain lesion analysis, validated through simulated forward modeling due to lack of pre-lesion data.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

TL;DR: R-VLM improves GUI element grounding by using zoomed-in region proposals and an IoU-aware objective, boosting accuracy by 13% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with cluttered screens and basic loss functions, leading to poor grounding accuracy.

Method: Proposes R-VLM with zoomed-in region proposals and an IoU-aware objective for precise element localization.

Result: Achieves 13% higher grounding accuracy on benchmarks and 3.2-9.7% improvements in navigation tasks.

Conclusion: R-VLM bridges VLMs and object detection, enhancing GUI automation performance.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical video generation is underexplored despite its importance for clinical training and education. Current models lack accuracy due to insufficient medical-specific datasets.

Method: The authors create MedVideoCap-55K, a dataset of 55,000 curated medical clips, and develop MedGen, a model trained on this dataset.

Result: MedGen achieves top performance in benchmarks for visual quality and medical accuracy, surpassing open-source models and competing with commercial systems.

Conclusion: The dataset and model serve as a foundation for advancing medical video generation research, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

*Jiahui Wang,Qin Xu,Bo Jiang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve prompt learning by modeling structural relationships between prompts and tokens, and introduces a sample probing module for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for VLMs often overlook structural relationships between prompts and tokens, and struggle with balancing performance across base and new classes.

Method: ISP includes self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to enhance inter-modal interactions and a sample probing module for dynamic loss adjustment.

Result: ISP achieves competitive performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ISP effectively improves VLM transferability by addressing structural relationships and sample difficulty, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

*Yisu Zhang,Chenjie Cao,Chaohui Yu,Jianke Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiON-LoRA improves video diffusion models by enhancing control over camera trajectories and object motion through linear scalability, orthogonality, and norm consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise control over camera trajectories and object motion in VDMs is challenging due to unstable fusion and non-linear scalability.

Method: LiON-LoRA introduces three principles: linear scalability, orthogonality, and norm consistency, and integrates a controllable token into the diffusion transformer for decoupled control.

Result: LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment with minimal training data.

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA provides superior generalization and controllability in video synthesis, unifying spatial and temporal control.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

### [147] [Event-RGB Fusion for Spacecraft Pose Estimation Under Harsh Lighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05698)
*Mohsi Jawaid,Marcus Märtens,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation, addressing limitations of individual sensors like harsh lighting conditions and low resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spacecraft pose estimation is vital for autonomous operations but is challenged by harsh lighting conditions affecting RGB sensors and low resolution/noise in event sensors.

Method: A beam-splitter prism aligns RGB and event sensors optically and temporally. A RANSAC-based technique fuses data, and dropout uncertainty estimation detects extreme conditions.

Result: The method was tested on a real dataset under challenging illumination, showing efficacy in leveraging both sensor modalities.

Conclusion: The fusion approach improves pose estimation, supports event sensor usage, and the dataset will be released for community research.

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in HAD (e.g., computational complexity, noise sensitivity) and provide a comprehensive comparison of methods for improved anomaly detection.

Method: Categorized and evaluated HAD techniques (statistical models, representation-based, classical ML, deep learning) across 17 datasets using metrics like ROC, AUC, and separability maps.

Result: Deep learning models achieved highest accuracy; statistical models were fastest. Trade-offs between accuracy and speed were identified.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for advancing HAD, recommending deep learning for accuracy and statistical models for speed, with future research directions.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SenseShift6D introduces a new RGB-D dataset to study 6D object-pose estimation under varying real-world conditions like illumination and sensor settings, showing test-time sensor control outperforms data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack real-world variations in illumination and sensor settings, limiting understanding of their impact on 6D pose estimation.

Method: The dataset captures 13 RGB exposures, 9 gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth modes, and 5 illumination levels for three objects, totaling 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images.

Result: Test-time sensor control improves performance more than data augmentation, with multimodal RGB-D adaptation yielding the best results.

Conclusion: SenseShift6D shifts focus to sensor-aware robustness, enabling adaptive perception systems for uncertain real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Conclusion: The proposed automatic white balance solution is superior for microscopic images compared to classical methods.

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

TL;DR: DreamArt introduces a framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated 3D objects from single-view images, addressing limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling, while neural reconstruction approaches require dense data, limiting scalability.

Method: DreamArt uses a three-stage pipeline: part-segmented 3D mesh reconstruction, video diffusion for articulation priors, and motion optimization with texture refinement.

Result: DreamArt generates high-quality articulated objects with accurate part shape, appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation.

Conclusion: DreamArt provides a scalable solution for articulated asset generation, advancing applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods lack versatility and flexibility, focusing on single tasks. TalkFashion aims to address this by leveraging large language models for multifunctional guidance.

Method: TalkFashion uses large language models to interpret user instructions and activate task-specific pipelines. It includes an instruction-based local repainting model for automated edits.

Result: The method achieves better semantic consistency and visual quality than current approaches, fully automating local editing tasks.

Conclusion: TalkFashion enhances virtual try-on flexibility and versatility, demonstrating superior performance in text-guided tasks.

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results

TL;DR: SPADE improves Panoptic Scene Graph Generation by addressing VLM limitations in spatial reasoning using a diffusion model and spatial-aware transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using VLMs for PSG ignore their spatial reasoning limitations, leading to poor relation predictions.

Method: SPADE uses inversion-guided calibration and spatial-aware context reasoning with a LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy and a relation graph transformer.

Result: SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSG and Visual Genome datasets, especially in spatial relationship prediction.

Conclusion: SPADE effectively enhances spatial relation understanding in PSG, setting new benchmarks for performance.

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Motivation: Existing methods for document reconstruction suffer from error propagation in multi-stage approaches or lack layout preservation in generative models, necessitating a more comprehensive solution.

Method: Proposes DREAM, an autoregressive model that transforms text images into document sequences end-to-end, incorporating layout and element information. Introduces DSM metric and DocRec1K dataset for evaluation.

Result: DREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in document reconstruction and performs competitively in subtasks like layout analysis, text recognition, and formula recognition.

Conclusion: DREAM offers a robust, end-to-end solution for document reconstruction, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating versatility across related tasks.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

*Samed Doğan,Maximilian Hoh,Nico Leuze,Nicolas R. -Peña,Alfred Schöttl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generating synthetic camera sensor data for autonomous driving by introducing solar altitude as a global conditioning variable, reducing reliance on manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data acquisition for autonomous driving is costly and limited by labeling, safety, and scenario diversity. Synthetic data generation, especially for daytime variations, lacks research due to label scarcity.

Method: The paper proposes using solar altitude (derived from latitude-longitude and time) as a conditioning variable, with a tailored normalization approach to handle daylight sensitivity.

Result: The method effectively captures lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent noise in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Solar altitude is a practical solution for synthetic data generation, reducing manual effort while accurately modeling daytime variations.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

*Wang Wang,Mingyu Shi,Jun Jiang,Wenqian Ma,Chong Liu,Yasutaka Narazaki,Xuguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating synthetic 3D bridge point clouds with annotations and realistic incompleteness to improve segmentation and completion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bridge inspection is inefficient, and real-world 3D data is often incomplete, limiting the potential of data-driven methods.

Method: Proposes a systematic framework to generate synthetic 3D bridge data with complete point clouds, annotations, and simulated incompleteness.

Result: PointNet++ trained on synthetic data achieves 84.2% mIoU in real-world segmentation; KT-Net excels in component completion.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel approach and dataset for 3D bridge analysis, enhancing automated infrastructure management.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

*Yuhuan Xie,Aoxuan Pan,Ming-Xian Lin,Wei Huang,Yi-Hua Huang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel '2D-3D-2D' framework improves 2D image editing by leveraging 3D representation for consistency and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D generative models struggle with consistency and object identity due to pixel-level manipulations.

Method: Lifts 2D objects into 3D, edits them in a rigidity-constrained 3D environment, and reprojects them back into 2D.

Result: Outperforms methods like DragGAN and DragDiffusion, offering consistent edits and robust identity preservation.

Conclusion: The '2D-3D-2D' framework enhances 2D image editing by integrating 3D manipulation for better realism and consistency.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

*L'ea Dubois,Klaus Schmidt,Chengyu Wang,Ji-Hoon Park,Lin Wang,Santiago Munoz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance video understanding with causal reasoning and future prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models lack commonsense knowledge for high-level cognitive tasks like reasoning and prediction.

Method: The framework fuses a VFM for visual perception with an LLM for reasoning, using a Q-Former-inspired fusion module to align visual features with language. Training involves pre-training on video-text data and fine-tuning for reasoning tasks.

Result: The model excels in benchmarks, shows zero-shot generalization, and ablation studies confirm its components' importance.

Conclusion: This work advances AI perception beyond recognition to cognitive understanding, benefiting robotics and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

*Ourui Fu,Hangzhou He,Xinliang Zhang,Lei Zhu,Shuang Zeng,ZhaoHeng Xie,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I²R, a novel few-shot segmentation method addressing inter- and intra-image discrepancies to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation and limitations of current few-shot segmentation methods due to semantic gaps and visually similar regions.

Method: Proposes I²R with category-specific high-level representations and a directional masking strategy to address feature mismatches and inconsistent pixel pairs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.9% and 2.1% mIoU improvements on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i benchmarks.

Conclusion: I²R effectively addresses key limitations in few-shot segmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

*Yue Peng,Bing Xiong,Fuqiang Chen,De Eybo,RanRan Zhang,Wanming Hu,Jing Cai,Wenjian Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USIGAN improves IHC virtual staining by addressing weak pairing issues with unbalanced self-information feature transport, enhancing pathological consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly paired conditions in IHC virtual staining cause spatial heterogeneity, leading to inaccurate mappings and inconsistent results.

Method: Proposes USIGAN with Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) and Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanisms to improve consistency.

Result: Superior performance on clinical metrics like IoD and Pearson-R correlation, showing better clinical relevance.

Conclusion: USIGAN effectively mitigates weak pairing challenges, improving content and pathological consistency in IHC virtual staining.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing-based crop yield prediction struggle with limited spatial modeling and weak generalization across crop types and years.

Method: DFYP introduces three components: Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA), Adaptive Operator Learning Network (AOL-Net), and a dual-branch architecture with a learnable fusion mechanism.

Result: DFYP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different resolutions, crop types, and time periods.

Conclusion: DFYP is effective and robust for real-world agricultural monitoring, demonstrating superior performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

TL;DR: D-FCGS is a feedforward framework for compressing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting sequences, achieving high compression rates and visual quality without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient compression of dynamic 3D representations for free-viewpoint video (FVV) is challenging, and existing methods lack generalizability due to coupling reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding.

Method: Introduces a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, using sparse control points for motion extraction and a dual prior-aware entropy model for compression. Reconstruction involves motion compensation and refinement.

Result: Achieves over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds, matching optimization-based methods in rate-distortion performance while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: D-FCGS advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, enabling scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMag is a new framework for remote sensing image understanding that dynamically adjusts attention and resolution to handle multi-granularity tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS-VLMs are limited to image/region-level tasks, perform poorly on small objects, and are computationally expensive for high-resolution images.

Method: GeoMag uses Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC) to focus on relevant regions and reduce redundancy.

Result: GeoMag excels in pixel-level tasks and maintains competitive performance across other granularities, outperforming existing RS-VLMs.

Conclusion: GeoMag addresses the limitations of current RS-VLMs, offering improved efficiency and performance for remote sensing image parsing.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking, addressing performance degradation in existing trackers due to temporally incomplete multimodal data. The proposed model dynamically adapts to missing data and scene complexity, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal data enhances visual tracking but suffers from synchronization issues, leading to temporal data shortages. Existing trackers lack adaptability to missing modalities, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: A flexible framework with a Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism and video-level masking strategy is proposed. It dynamically activates computational units based on missing data rates and ensures temporal and spatial consistency.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both complete and missing modality settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles missing multimodal data, outperforming existing trackers and adapting to varying scene complexities.

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the suitability of explainable AI (xAI) methods and metrics for remote sensing (RS) scene classification, identifying limitations and providing guidelines for method and metric selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing xAI methods and metrics, initially designed for natural images, may not be suitable for RS due to unique challenges like spatial characteristics and multi-label scenarios.

Method: The study analyzes ten explanation metrics across five categories, applied to five feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, DeepLIFT) on three RS datasets.

Result: Perturbation-based methods depend on baselines and spatial traits, gradient-based methods struggle with multi-label images, and relevance propagation can misallocate relevance. Metrics like faithfulness and localization are unreliable for large spatial classes, while robustness and randomization metrics are stable.

Conclusion: The paper provides guidelines for selecting xAI methods and metrics in RS scene classification, highlighting stable metrics and addressing method-specific limitations.

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

*Xinyu Huang,Yuhao Dong,Weiwei Tian,Bo Li,Rui Feng,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGPO is an RL framework for LMMs to focus on key visual regions in high-resolution images, improving grounding without costly annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of LMMs in processing high-resolution images due to irrelevant visual tokens.

Method: Uses RL with multi-turn conversations to iteratively crop sub-images based on predicted grounding coordinates, leveraging binary rewards.

Result: Improves grounding capabilities, outperforming GRPO and surpassing OpenAI models on OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: MGPO effectively enhances LMMs' grounding abilities without additional annotations, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric awareness via monocular depth estimation to improve Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) robustness, testing three methods (EDC, SV, DS), with EDC and SV showing significant improvements and EDC achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in VIS like occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations by incorporating depth cues for better temporal association.

Method: Three integration paradigms: Expanding Depth Channel (EDC), Sharing ViT (SV), and Depth Supervision (DS). EDC adds depth maps as input; SV shares a ViT backbone; DS uses depth as auxiliary training.

Result: EDC and SV significantly enhance VIS robustness. EDC with Swin-L backbone achieves 56.2 AP, setting a new state-of-the-art on OVIS benchmark.

Conclusion: Depth cues are critical for robust video understanding, with EDC and SV proving effective in enhancing VIS performance.

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

*Aoxiang Fan,Corentin Dumery,Nicolas Talabot,Hieu Le,Pascal Fua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sparse representation method for neural surface reconstruction improves memory efficiency and enables higher resolution reconstructions without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense 3D feature volumes are inefficient for high-resolution reconstructions, limiting quality.

Method: A two-stage approach: predict voxel occupancies, then compute features and render only in high-occupancy voxels. Custom algorithms for sparse volume handling are developed.

Result: Reduces storage by 50x, enables 512³ resolution (vs. 128³), and achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The sparse method scales efficiently, outperforming dense representations in reconstruction quality and hardware feasibility.

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Tora2 enhances Tora with improved appearance and motion customization, introducing a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention, and contrastive loss for better video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance motion-guided video generation by enabling simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion.

Method: Introduces a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention for multimodal conditioning, and a contrastive loss for joint optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods and advanced motion control.

Conclusion: Tora2 marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

*Vera Soboleva,Aibek Alanov,Andrey Kuznetsov,Konstantin Sobolev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-LoRA introduces a timestep-dependent low-rank adaptation framework for fine-tuning diffusion models with limited data, addressing overfitting and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt diffusion models using just a single concept image, overcoming overfitting and preserving output diversity.

Method: T-LoRA uses a dynamic fine-tuning strategy and weight parametrization with orthogonal initialization, adjusting updates based on diffusion timesteps.

Result: T-LoRA outperforms standard LoRA and other techniques, balancing concept fidelity and text alignment.

Conclusion: T-LoRA is effective for data-limited scenarios, offering a robust solution for diffusion model personalization.

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

*Haiwen Li,Delong Liu,Zhaohui Hou,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), creating a synthetic dataset (CIRHS) and a novel framework (CoAlign) for robust zero-shot and supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods rely on costly manual triplet labeling, limiting scalability and zero-shot capability.

Method: Proposes a pipeline using LLMs and text-to-image models to generate synthetic triplets (CIRHS) and introduces CoAlign for global and local alignment.

Result: CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on benchmarks and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised CIR methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of training CIR models on synthetic data and validates the effectiveness of CoAlign.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

*Xin Wu,Fei Teng,Yue Feng,Kaibo Shi,Zhuosheng Lin,Ji Zhang,James Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCINet is a novel framework for partial multi-label learning, leveraging multimodal models and semantic augmentation to improve label-instance matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ambiguous label-instance relationships in incompletely annotated data by focusing on co-occurrence patterns.

Method: Proposes SCINet with a bi-dominant prompter module, cross-modality fusion, and intrinsic semantic augmentation to enhance semantic alignment and label confidence.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SCINet effectively addresses partial multi-label learning by improving semantic alignment and leveraging multimodal insights.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble-based deepfake detection improves generalization across diverse datasets compared to single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models perform poorly on out-of-distribution data, prompting the need for more robust solutions.

Method: Combines prediction probabilities from multiple state-of-the-art asymmetric models into an ensemble.

Result: Ensemble predictions outperform single models in stability and reliability across out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Asymmetric ensembling is a robust and scalable solution for real-world deepfake detection.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery
type or quality is often unavailable.

*Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Atif Mansoor,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for geo-registering LiDAR point clouds in GNSS-denied urban areas by aligning them with satellite images, using road segmentation and intersection points for global and local refinement, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in geo-registering LiDAR point clouds in GNSS-denied urban areas due to reliance on unstable GNSS/IMU data, necessitating a method independent of prior localization.

Method: Uses a Point Transformer model for road segmentation, extracts road skeletons and intersection points for global alignment, refines locally with RBF interpolation, and corrects elevation using SRTM data.

Result: Achieved 55.3% and 77.4% planimetric alignment improvements on KITTI and Perth datasets, respectively, with elevation correlation gains of 30.5% and 50.4%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses geo-registration challenges in GNSS-denied areas, offering robust alignment and elevation correction for urban 3D mapping.

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCDA, a framework to improve text rendering in diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results in readability and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating readable and correctly spelled text, limiting practical applications like advertising and design.

Method: GCDA extends diffusion models with a dual-stream text encoder, character-aware attention, and OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning.

Result: GCDA outperforms benchmarks in text rendering (lower error rates) and maintains high image fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Conclusion: GCDA addresses a critical limitation in text-to-image models, enabling practical use in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSpeaker improves 3D facial animation using photorealistic rendering and perceptual lip-reading loss, outperforming prior methods by 56.1% in Lip Vertex Error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D facial animations are needed for expressive avatars, but mesh-based methods lag behind 2D innovations.

Method: Uses photorealistic differentiable rendering supervised by visual speech recognition, with a perceptual lip-reading loss derived from 3D Gaussian Splatting and a pre-trained VASR model.

Result: Achieves a 56.1% improvement in Lip Vertex Error and better perceptual quality on the MEAD dataset.

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker bridges the gap between 2D and 3D methods, enhancing animation quality and controllability, especially for sign language avatars.

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

TL;DR: MEDTalk is a framework for dynamic emotional 3D facial animation, disentangling content and emotion for realistic expressions, integrating audio and text, and supporting multimodal inputs for personalized results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on static emotion labels, limiting diversity and naturalness in facial animations.

Method: Disentangles content and emotion via cross-reconstruction, integrates audio and text for dynamic expressions, and uses multimodal inputs for control.

Result: Generates fine-grained, dynamic emotional expressions suitable for industrial pipelines like MetaHuman.

Conclusion: MEDTalk advances emotional facial animation by enabling independent control and realistic, personalized expressions.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAM introduces a multimodal causal analysis model for autonomous driving, addressing shallow causality and spurious correlations by leveraging visual-language alignment and DAG-based causal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for driving behavior recognition lack deep causal analysis, ignore multimodal spurious correlations, and fail to model ego-vehicle causality.

Method: MCAM uses a multi-level feature extractor, a DAG-based causal analysis module, and a vision-language transformer for feature alignment.

Result: MCAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BDD-X and CoVLA datasets, excelling in causal relationship learning and video sequence analysis.

Conclusion: MCAM effectively addresses limitations in autonomous driving video understanding, demonstrating superior causal modeling and multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

*Francesco Milano,Manuel López-Antequera,Naina Dhingra,Roland Siegwart,Robert Thiel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for 3D surface recovery from normal maps, explicitly handling discontinuities and supporting generic central cameras, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal integration methods fail to explicitly address depth discontinuities and are limited to specific camera models, restricting their applicability.

Method: Proposes a formulation based on local planarity, modeling constraints between surface normals and ray directions for accurate depth approximation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and is the first to support generic central cameras.

Conclusion: The approach advances normal integration by improving accuracy and broadening applicability to diverse camera models.

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

*Chihan Huang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreAdv introduces a diffusion model-based method for generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs) with high success rates and image quality, outperforming GAN-based and other diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods rely on unnatural perturbation constraints or suffer from poor image quality. The goal is to generate UAEs that align with human perception and are effective against various models.

Method: ScoreAdv uses an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism and saliency maps to shift the sampling distribution toward adversarial examples, leveraging diffusion models' denoising capabilities without iterative PGD perturbation.

Result: ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, attacking ten target models in black-box and white-box settings. It remains robust under defensive measures.

Conclusion: ScoreAdv is a novel, effective method for generating UAEs, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST-Phys, a multi-modal dataset for remote physiological emotion recognition, addressing limitations of contact-based methods and emphasizing the importance of physiological signals alongside facial cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of non-contact, multi-modal datasets for emotion recognition and the influence of contact-based devices on genuine emotional responses motivate the creation of CAST-Phys.

Method: The authors present CAST-Phys, a dataset combining physiological signals (PPG, EDA, RR) and high-resolution facial videos for remote emotion recognition. They analyze the role of physiological signals and evaluate modality fusion.

Result: The dataset enables remote signal recovery and demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-modal fusion in improving contactless emotion recognition.

Conclusion: CAST-Phys advances contactless emotion recognition by providing a high-quality, multi-modal dataset and validating the importance of physiological signals in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CultureCLIP, a fine-tuned version of CLIP, to address its limitations in distinguishing culturally distinct but visually similar concepts. It uses a synthetic dataset, CulTwin, and customized contrastive learning to improve fine-grained cultural recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP struggle with fine-grained cultural distinctions due to lack of culture-specific datasets and contextual knowledge.

Method: A synthetic dataset (CulTwin) is created using VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models. CLIP is fine-tuned on this dataset with customized contrastive learning to produce CultureCLIP.

Result: CultureCLIP outperforms CLIP by up to 5.49% in fine-grained cultural recognition while maintaining generalization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures subtle cultural distinctions, validating the data synthesis and training paradigm.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

### [184] [Reflections Unlock: Geometry-Aware Reflection Disentanglement in 3D Gaussian Splatting for Photorealistic Scenes Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06103)
*Jiayi Song,Zihan Ye,Qingyuan Zhou,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Jingyi Xu,Ying He,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ref-Unlock is a geometry-aware reflection modeling framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to disentangle reflections from scene geometry, improving rendering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS misinterpret reflections as physical geometry, degrading reconstructions. Ref-Unlock aims to address this by explicitly modeling reflections.

Method: Uses a dual-branch representation with spherical harmonics for high-frequency details, a reflection removal module, pseudo-depth maps, and geometry-aware constraints.

Result: Outperforms GS-based methods and competes with NeRF-based models, enabling realistic rendering and reflection editing.

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock provides an efficient, generalizable solution for rendering reflective scenes.

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Omni-Video is a unified framework for video understanding, generation, and editing, leveraging MLLMs and diffusion decoders with efficient training and lightweight design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models focus on images, leaving a gap in unified video understanding and generation. Omni-Video aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses MLLMs to produce visual clues for diffusion decoders, with a lightweight architecture and efficient multi-stage training.

Result: Demonstrates satisfactory generalization across video tasks like generation, editing, and understanding.

Conclusion: Omni-Video effectively unifies video tasks, showing promise for future video modeling.

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

*Haoyu Wang,Lei Zhang,Wei Wei,Chen Ding,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation is proposed, addressing issues of category and quantity deviation while improving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-object image generation either deviate from original data due to text reliance or lack diversity due to over-reliance on original images.

Method: Uses a local-global semantic fusion strategy to replace text, injects knowledge via LoRA, and employs a reward model with counting loss for training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showing strong downstream task gains and generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances fidelity and diversity in multi-object image augmentation.

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

was implemented. SoftReMish was evaluated against popular activation functions
including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all
trainable layers. The model performance was assessed in terms of minimum

*Nathan Kessler,Robin Magnet,Jean Feydy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a class of smoothing operators derived from similarity or adjacency matrices, normalized to behave like diffusion operators, enabling Laplacian-like smoothing for irregular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing smoothing methods rely on well-structured domains or simple convolution kernels, which are biased against boundaries. The goal is to generalize Laplacian-based smoothing to irregular data.

Method: The approach uses a symmetric Sinkhorn algorithm to rescale positive smoothing operators, mimicking heat diffusion properties of Laplacians.

Result: The derived operators approximate heat diffusion and retain spectral Laplacian properties, applicable to irregular data like point clouds or sparse grids.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gap between Laplacian-based smoothing and irregular data, offering theoretical guarantees and practical applications in shape analysis.

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniPart is a framework for part-aware 3D object generation, enabling editable part structures and high semantic decoupling, outperforming monolithic generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods produce monolithic 3D shapes, limiting utility for interactive applications requiring editable part structures.

Method: OmniPart uses a two-stage approach: (1) autoregressive structure planning for part bounding boxes guided by 2D masks, and (2) a rectified flow model for simultaneous 3D part synthesis within the layout.

Result: OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting user-defined granularity, precise localization, and diverse applications.

Conclusion: OmniPart advances interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content generation.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in visual question answering (VQA) for scientific data, proposing an approach for the SciVQA 2025 task using large models and ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods lack precision in interpreting scientific figures, especially for numerical values and multi-step reasoning.

Method: Experiments with models (5B-8B parameters), including InternVL3 and ensemble VLMs, using prompt optimization and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: InternVL3 achieved ROUGE-1/L F1 scores of 0.740 and BERTScore 0.983; ensemble models improved performance but InternVL3 remained the best standalone.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble modeling enhance VQA performance for scientific data.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDINO is a novel unsupervised method for semantic scene completion (SSC) that avoids costly ground-truth annotations by leveraging self-supervised learning and multi-view consistency. It achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and matches supervised approaches in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior SSC methods rely on expensive ground-truth annotations, limiting scalability. SceneDINO addresses this by proposing an unsupervised approach using self-supervised techniques.

Method: SceneDINO adapts self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC. It uses multi-view consistency self-supervision and a novel 3D feature distillation approach to infer 3D geometry and semantics without ground truth.

Result: SceneDINO achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy in unsupervised 3D and 2D scene understanding. Its 3D features match the performance of supervised SSC methods via linear probing.

Conclusion: SceneDINO demonstrates strong potential as a foundation for single-image 3D scene understanding, showcasing domain generalization and multi-view consistency.

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

*Keyan Chen,Chenyang Liu,Bowen Chen,Jiafan Zhang,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2 introduces a decoupling paradigm for remote sensing image segmentation, improving accuracy and semantic interpretation by separating coarse localization and fine segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with complex semantic relationships and cross-modal alignment due to coupled processing, limiting generalizability and interpretability.

Method: RSRefSeg 2 uses CLIP for dual-modal encoding and SAM for segmentation, with a cascaded second-order prompter to refine semantic prompts.

Result: The method outperforms others by ~3% gIoU in segmentation accuracy and handles complex semantics better.

Conclusion: RSRefSeg 2 offers a robust solution for remote sensing segmentation, enhancing precision and interpretability through decoupled processing.

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: AnthroTAP automates pseudo-labeled training data generation for point tracking using the SMPL model, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion is complex and rich for supervision but manual annotation is laborious. AnthroTAP addresses this by automating data generation.

Method: Fits SMPL to detected humans, projects 3D vertices to 2D for pseudo-trajectories, handles occlusions with ray-casting, and filters tracks using optical flow.

Result: Achieves top performance on TAP-Vid benchmark with 10,000x less data and 1 day on 4 GPUs vs. 256 GPUs for SOTA.

Conclusion: AnthroTAP provides an efficient, scalable solution for training robust point trackers without extensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: TokenShapley improves token-level attribution in LLMs by combining Shapley values and KNN retrieval, outperforming baselines by 11-23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentence-level attribution methods fail for specific keywords in LLM responses, necessitating a finer-grained approach.

Method: TokenShapley integrates Shapley value-based attribution with KNN retrieval, using a precomputed datastore for contextual retrieval.

Result: TokenShapley achieves 11-23% higher accuracy in token-level attribution compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TokenShapley effectively addresses the need for fine-grained attribution in LLM responses, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks are flawed for measuring LLM generalization due to data contamination and lack of task-specific training.

Method: A novel framework for user behavior prediction is introduced and tested on movie and music recommendation datasets.

Result: GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4o-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, but all models show significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: User behavior prediction is a scalable and robust alternative for measuring LLM generalization, with GPT-4o leading but requiring further refinement.

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,

TL;DR: ASCEND introduces adaptive supervised contrastive learning for implicit sexism detection, outperforming existing methods with significant F1 improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods overlook implicit sexism in social media, necessitating a more nuanced detection approach.

Method: ASCEND uses threshold-based contrastive learning, joint optimization of contrastive and cross-entropy loss, and enhanced textual features.

Result: ASCEND achieves average Macro F1 improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% on EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets.

Conclusion: ASCEND effectively captures subtle implicit sexist language, reducing false positives and negatives.

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

TL;DR: A novel AI framework improves dropout prediction by combining sentiment analysis, prompt engineering, and cross-modal attention, achieving 89% accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of classical models in capturing emotional and contextual factors in student dropout prediction.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to identify stressors, and cross-modal attention to fuse insights.

Result: Achieves 89% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%.

Conclusion: Bridges predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering scalable solutions to reduce dropout risks globally.

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LCDS is a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary system designed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs by using source mapping and logical rules for reliable, attributed summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucination issues in LLMs for discharge summaries and handle long-form EMR data by ensuring content accuracy and source attribution.

Method: LCDS constructs a source mapping table via textual similarity and applies logical rules to generate reliable summaries with source attribution.

Result: Produces silver and golden discharge summaries, enabling expert review and incremental LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LCDS improves reliability and attribution in discharge summaries, supporting clinical applications and LLM refinement.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

### [200] [LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05346)
*William Fleshman,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAG (LoRA-Augmented Generation) efficiently selects and combines task-specific LoRA adapters without additional training or data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient methods to leverage large libraries of task-specific language model experts.

Method: LAG filters, retrieves, and applies LoRA adapters per-token and layer without training or data.

Result: Superior performance on knowledge-intensive tasks compared to data-free methods; compatible with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Conclusion: LAG is a versatile and efficient solution for leveraging task-specific adapters, even with additional data.

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training
or access to data, and efficiently filters, retrieves, and applies experts on a
per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

### [201] [On the Bias of Next-Token Predictors Toward Systematically Inefficient Reasoning: A Shortest-Path Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05362)
*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training LLMs on inefficient reasoning traces (e.g., backtracking) improves generalization better than optimal traces, likely due to increased model confidence in next-token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how reasoning trace structure and compute allocation impact LLM performance, focusing on systematic and incremental reasoning.

Method: Controlled experiments with decoder-only transformers trained on shortest-path tasks using optimal vs. inefficient (backtracking) reasoning traces.

Result: Models trained on inefficient traces generalize better, linked to higher confidence in next-token prediction, not trace length alone.

Conclusion: Long, coherent, and locally incremental reasoning traces enhance training optimization and generalization in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

TL;DR: EduCoder is a specialized tool for annotating educational dialogue, addressing challenges like complex codebooks, mixed annotation types, and contextualization, while supporting collaborative annotation and reliability improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose text annotation tools lack features for the complexities of educational dialogue, such as diverse interactions and pedagogical nuances.

Method: EduCoder provides a platform for collaborative codebook definition, supports categorical and open-ended annotations, includes contextual materials, and enables annotator comparison for reliability.

Result: The tool is open-source and includes a demo, demonstrating its feasibility for educational dialogue annotation.

Conclusion: EduCoder fills a gap in annotation tools for educational research, offering specialized features to improve data reliability and collaboration.

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

### [203] [The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387)
*Ruidi Chang,Chunyuan Deng,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, analyzes how predictive information varies across transformer layers, revealing a non-monotonic trend with a peak in upper-middle layers (generalization ridge).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how transformer layers synthesize task-relevant information and generalize, given the unclear emergence of generalization ability across layers.

Method: Proposes InfoRidge to estimate mutual information between hidden representations and target outputs, and introduces residual scaling coefficients to probe layer importance.

Result: Predictive information peaks in upper-middle layers (generalization ridge) and declines in final layers, with ridge layers being crucial under distribution shift.

Conclusion: Intermediate layers play a critical role in generalization, offering insights into transformer mechanisms.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

### [204] [Controlling What You Share: Assessing Language Model Adherence to Privacy Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05391)
*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes privacy profiles—natural language instructions for controlling data exposure—to balance privacy and performance when using LLMs. It introduces PEEP, a dataset for this research, and tests lightweight LLMs, revealing challenges in compliance with user-defined privacy preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns when using commercial LLM APIs, ensuring users retain control over their sensitive data.

Method: A framework where a local model rewrites queries based on privacy profiles (natural language instructions) before sending them to an external LLM. PEEP, a multilingual dataset, is introduced to support this.

Result: Lightweight LLMs can partially follow privacy profiles but struggle with consistent compliance, indicating a need for better models.

Conclusion: Privacy profiles offer a promising approach for data control, but improved models are needed to fully adhere to user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoFact-X, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating reasoning in LLMs, and BRIDGE, a training method to improve reasoning fidelity in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in multilingual reasoning, especially for low-resource languages, leading to biases and inaccuracies.

Method: Developed GeoFact-X with annotated reasoning traces in five languages and proposed BRIDGE, a training method using language-consistency rewards.

Result: BRIDGE significantly improves multilingual reasoning fidelity in LLMs.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is key for robust cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

*Yufei Tao,Adam Hiatt,Rahul Seetharaman,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPE, a framework to evaluate how LLMs prioritize contextual (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK). It reveals a 'lost-in-the-later' bias and shows that reasoning models and CoT prompting degrade contextual grounding. Prompt-based methods are proposed to improve factual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs integrate and prioritize CK and PK, which remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces CoPE framework and MultiWikiAtomic dataset to analyze LLMs' behavior in open-ended QA. Examines positional bias ('lost-in-the-later') and the impact of CoT prompting.

Result: LLMs show a strong positional bias, and reasoning models/CoT prompting worsen contextual grounding. CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding.

Conclusion: CoPE provides insights into LLMs' knowledge integration. Prompt-based methods can enhance factual grounding, addressing biases like 'lost-in-the-later'.

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

*Ashwin Rao,Sze Yuh Nina Wang,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes 10 million abortion-related posts on X (Twitter), revealing that gender and local sociopolitical contexts significantly shape abortion discourse, with a pronounced gender gap in conservative regions. The Dobbs ruling intensified engagement, especially among pro-abortion women in threatened areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how gender and local contexts interact to shape public discourse on abortion, beyond ideological divides.

Method: Analysis of nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X (Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology, and location.

Result: Gender moderates abortion attitudes and emotional expression, with a growing gap in conservative regions. The Dobbs leak mobilized pro-abortion women disproportionately in threatened areas.

Conclusion: Abortion discourse is not just ideologically polarized but also deeply influenced by gender and place, emphasizing identity's role in political expression during institutional disruptions.

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

TL;DR: PhoniTale, a cross-lingual mnemonic generation system, uses LLMs to create mnemonics for L2 vocabulary learning, performing comparably to human-authored mnemonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of vocabulary acquisition for L2 learners, especially for typologically distant languages like English and Korean, by leveraging phonological similarity and LLMs.

Method: PhoniTale retrieves L1 keyword sequences based on phonological similarity and employs LLMs to generate mnemonics, evaluated via automated metrics, human evaluations, and a recall test.

Result: PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics, demonstrating practical effectiveness in aiding vocabulary recall.

Conclusion: The system shows promise but requires further improvements in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs like ChatGPT truly understand language by analyzing their semantic capabilities at word and sentence levels, referencing classical theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the extent of LLMs' language understanding, focusing on semantics.

Method: Examines LLMs' inner workings and language representations, using theories by Frege and Russell.

Result: Provides a nuanced view of LLMs' semantic potential.

Conclusion: LLMs' understanding of language is complex and requires further nuanced analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MODELCITIZENS, a dataset for toxic language detection, highlighting the subjectivity of toxicity and the need for community-informed annotations. It also presents finetuned models (LLAMACITIZEN-8B, GEMMACITIZEN-12B) that outperform existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing toxicity detection models ignore diverse annotator perspectives and context-specific notions of toxicity, leading to biased or incomplete moderation.

Method: The authors created MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts with 40K annotations, augmented with LLM-generated conversational contexts. They finetuned LLaMA- and Gemma-based models on this dataset.

Result: State-of-the-art tools underperform on MODELCITIZENS, especially with context-augmented posts. The finetuned models outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% in evaluations.

Conclusion: Community-informed annotation and modeling are crucial for inclusive and accurate toxicity detection in online spaces.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling
for inclusive content moderation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and sensitivity in high-impact clinical NLP tasks to reduce healthcare documentation burden and improve patient care focus.

Method: Evaluates open- and closed-weight LLMs on private and open-source datasets, proposes an agentic pipeline for generating realistic nurse dictations.

Result: Performance analysis of LLMs on the tasks and introduction of SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source datasets for these areas.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for clinical NLP tasks, and the released datasets support further research in structured reporting and medical order extraction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

TL;DR: R2-LLMs is a hierarchical retrieval-augmented framework improving test-time scaling in LLMs without needing CoT training data, enhancing reasoning via dual-level retrieval and MCTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inference-time generalization in LLMs without relying on distillation from advanced models for CoT data.

Method: Uses dual-level retrieval (coarse for problem-answer pairs, fine for intermediate steps) and MCTS with a PRM for scoring.

Result: Achieves up to 16% improvement on MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO datasets using LLaMA-3.1-8B.

Conclusion: R2-LLMs effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs, integrating retrieval and tree search for better accuracy.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Re5 is a self-evaluation and revision framework for LLMs that improves instruction-following performance while preserving output quality, achieving results comparable to high-performance models with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving LLM adherence to instructions face challenges like high costs, quality degradation, or limited self-evaluation capabilities.

Method: Re5 extracts task and constraint components, performs structural evaluations, and applies fine-grained content evaluations with selective revisions.

Result: Re5 achieves a 64.24%-win rate over non-revised responses and matches GPT-4o-mini's performance with less data.

Conclusion: Re5 is an efficient and effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external supervision.

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

### [214] [Flipping Knowledge Distillation: Leveraging Small Models' Expertise to Enhance LLMs in Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05617)
*Mingzhe Li,Jing Xiang,Qishen Zhang,Kaiyang Wan,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A flipped knowledge distillation paradigm where LLMs learn from SLMs is introduced, leveraging domain-specific strengths of SLMs and semantic understanding of LLMs. The method uses LoRA to bridge architectural gaps and employs Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the specialized strengths of small models (SLMs) in tasks like text matching with the rich semantic understanding of large models (LLMs).

Method: Reinterpret LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder generates compressed representations, and the decoder maps them to output. MCL aligns similarity scores from the teacher (SLM) and student (LLM).

Result: Improved performance of LLMs on financial and healthcare benchmarks, with successful deployment in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The flipped distillation paradigm effectively leverages SLMs to enhance LLMs, demonstrating practical utility in specialized domains.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

TL;DR: SARA is a unified RAG framework that balances local precision and global knowledge coverage by combining text snippets and semantic compression vectors, improving answer relevance, correctness, and semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RAG, such as restricted context length and redundancy in retrieved documents, while preserving fine-grained details for factual accuracy.

Method: Uses natural-language text snippets and semantic compression vectors for context representation, with an iterative evidence-selection module for dynamic reranking.

Result: Improves answer relevance (+17.71), correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53) across 9 datasets and 5 LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and compressed representations enhances context efficiency and robustness in RAG.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Motivation: Address language confusion in multilingual LLMs, where dominant languages overshadow prompt languages, to improve reliability for global applications.

Method: Proposes Smoothie-Qwen, a post-hoc technique that selectively adjusts token-level output probabilities to suppress undesired language generation.

Result: Reduces unintended Chinese output by over 95% while maintaining task accuracy on multilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: Smoothie-Qwen offers a practical, efficient solution to enhance language controllability in LLMs, improving their global applicability.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit language confusion, a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of long-CoT models (slow, error-prone) and tool-augmented agents (weak on complex logic) by integrating complementary reasoning strategies.

Method: Fine-tuning framework (DualDistill) distills strategies from multiple teachers into a student model (Agentic-R1), dynamically choosing between tool-based and text-based reasoning.

Result: Improved accuracy on computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, showcasing robust and efficient reasoning.

Conclusion: Multi-strategy distillation (DualDistill) effectively enhances reasoning performance by leveraging complementary approaches.

Abstract: Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical

Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter
on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill,
that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a
unified student model. Using this approach, we train Agentic-R1, which
dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for
arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for
abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including
both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the

TL;DR: DRAGON is the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian, using a regularly updated news corpus and automated question generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG benchmarks for languages like Russian are scarce and static, lacking real-world applicability.

Method: DRAGON leverages a dynamic news corpus, Knowledge Graph-based question generation, and supports retriever-generator evaluation.

Result: A reusable framework with automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, and benchmark data is released, along with a public leaderboard.

Conclusion: DRAGON addresses the gap in dynamic RAG evaluation for Russian and encourages community involvement.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for
improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG
benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including
Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We
also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and
comparison.

*YiHan Jiao,ZheHao Tan,Dan Yang,DuoLin Sun,Jie Feng,Jian Wang,Peng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIRAG, a hierarchical instruction-tuning method for RAG models, enhancing their ability to filter, combine, and reason with external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in RAG systems, such as inconsistent document quality and lack of granular focus on RAG-specific tasks.

Method: Proposes HIRAG, incorporating hierarchical abilities (filtering, combination, RAG-specific reasoning) and a 'think before answering' strategy.

Result: HIRAG significantly improves performance on datasets like RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Conclusion: HIRAG enhances RAG models' capabilities, making them more effective for real-time and domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Omni-router Transformer, a shared router for MoE layers in ASR, improving expert cooperation and specialization, leading to better performance than dense and Switch Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE methods route experts independently per layer, lacking strong inter-layer correlation. The goal is to enhance expert cooperation and specialization.

Method: A shared router (Omni-router) is used across MoE layers to coordinate expert choices, tested on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and 10 diverse ASR benchmarks.

Result: Omni-router Transformer achieves lower training loss and reduces word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2% compared to dense and Switch Transformer models, respectively.

Conclusion: The shared router improves performance, structured expert usage, and robustness in diverse ASR tasks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between LLMs' pre-training data (prose) and their use in multi-turn conversations by creating synthetic conversational data.

Method: A pipeline transforms related documents into multi-turn dialogues, applied to Wikipedia to create DocTalk (730k conversations).

Result: Pre-training with DocTalk improves context memory and understanding by up to 40% without degrading base performance.

Conclusion: Synthesized conversational data enhances LLMs' multi-turn capabilities, demonstrated by DocTalk's effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LVLMs' inferential abilities on amodal completion tasks, revealing performance gaps, especially in Japanese prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LVLMs' capabilities in interpreting texts related to amodal completion, a phenomenon where humans perceive hidden objects.

Method: Constructed a benchmark using Basic Formal Ontology for systematic classification of amodal completion tasks.

Result: LVLMs show human-comparable performance overall but struggle with certain object types and Japanese prompts, revealing linguistic deficiencies.

Conclusion: LVLMs need improvement in handling specific object categories and non-English languages like Japanese for robust multimodal assistance.

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares performance and bias measures for Dutch ASR systems, emphasizing the need for additional metrics beyond averaged error rates to better assess bias and performance across diverse speaker groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive measures for evaluating bias and performance in ASR systems, particularly for diverse speaker groups.

Method: Comparison of various performance and bias measures, including literature-based and proposed metrics, applied to state-of-the-art Dutch ASR systems with bias mitigation strategies.

Result: Averaged error rates alone are insufficient; supplementary measures are needed to accurately evaluate bias and performance for diverse speakers.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for improved reporting of ASR performance and bias to ensure fair representation across speaker groups.

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for virtual respondent simulation using LLMs to efficiently generate and validate psychometric survey items by accounting for mediators, ensuring construct validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable survey item generation for LLMs while ensuring construct validity, traditionally requiring costly human data collection.

Method: Simulating respondents with diverse mediators to identify robust survey items, validated on three psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA).

Result: LLMs effectively generate plausible mediators and simulate respondent behavior, identifying high-validity items.

Conclusion: The framework offers a cost-effective approach for survey development and insights into LLM replication of human-like behavior, with released dataset and code for future work.

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of evaluation methodologies for knowledge editing in models, highlighting biases and false positives in current metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into the robustness of evaluation methodologies for knowledge editing and their potential biases, as well as the impact on model capabilities.

Method: Analyzes different metrics, evaluation methodologies, and edit batch sizes, and includes a manual assessment of string-matching evaluation methods.

Result: Shows that varying metrics and methodologies can alter editor rankings and reveals false positives in string-matching evaluations.

Conclusion: Current evaluation methods for knowledge editing may be unreliable and biased, requiring more robust approaches.

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes DAEDCMD, a continual Multimodal Misinformation Detection method, to address past knowledge forgetting and future generalization challenges in online data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads widely on social media, but existing detection methods trained on offline data become outdated as new events emerge. Continual MMD is needed but faces challenges like forgetting past knowledge and evolving social environments.

Method: Uses a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure to isolate event-specific parameters and a continuous-time dynamics model to anticipate future distributions.

Result: DAEDCMD outperforms six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods in experiments.

Conclusion: DAEDCMD effectively addresses the challenges of continual MMD, improving detection performance on past and future data.

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

Result: N-gram models and tries outperform deep learning for seen prefixes; neural models (T5, Phi-2) better for unseen queries. Conversational context boosts ghosting quality.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into Chat-Ghosting, highlighting the strengths of different methods and the value of context. Code and data are shared for further research.

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

*Lucas Fonseca Lage,Simon Ostermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenFActScore is an open-source version of FActScore for evaluating text factuality in LLMs, supporting any Hugging Face-compatible model. It matches closed-source performance and promotes transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent, reproducible, and cost-effective alternative to closed-source models for evaluating factual accuracy in LLM-generated text.

Method: Uses Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) and Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) with open models, evaluated using BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate for AFV.

Result: Open models like Gemma approximate closed-source performance, with a 0.99 Pearson correlation to original FActScore.

Conclusion: OpenFActScore successfully enables open, efficient, and accurate factuality evaluation for LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

*Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The ACL community lacks focus on evaluating NLP systems' real-world impact, with only 0.1% of papers addressing it, often superficially. Emphasizing impact could enhance NLP adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the gap in evaluating NLP systems' real-world impact in the ACL community and advocate for more focus on this aspect.

Method: Conducted a structured survey of the ACL Anthology to analyze the prevalence and depth of real-world impact evaluations in NLP papers.

Result: Only 0.1% of papers evaluate real-world impact, and even those often do so sketchily, prioritizing metric evaluations.

Conclusion: NLP technology would benefit from serious efforts to understand and evaluate its real-world impact, potentially accelerating adoption.

Abstract: The ACL community has very little interest in evaluating the real-world
impact of NLP systems. A structured survey of the ACL Anthology shows that
perhaps 0.1% of its papers contain such evaluations; furthermore most papers
which include impact evaluations present them very sketchily and instead focus
on metric evaluations. NLP technology would be more useful and more quickly
adopted if we seriously tried to understand and evaluate its real-world impact.

*Gabriel Chua,Leanne Tan,Ziyu Ge,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RabakBench is a multilingual safety benchmark for low-resource languages in Singapore, addressing LLM safety classifier limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and safety classifiers underperform in low-resource languages due to lack of data and benchmarks.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: adversarial example generation, semi-automated labeling, and high-fidelity translation.

Result: Over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages, revealing classifier performance degradation.

Conclusion: RabakBench provides a robust framework for localized safety evaluation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

*Minghang Zhu,Shen Gao,Zhengliang Shi,Jiabao Fang,Pengjie Ren,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen,Shuo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-evolution method for language models reduces training costs and carbon emissions by using a large-scale model to generate task principles and a smaller model for data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like high carbon emissions and data leakage in traditional data augmentation methods using closed-source LLMs.

Method: Multi-level Principle Generation for task principles and Principle-based Instance Generation for data creation using a smaller model.

Result: Improved model performance and reduced carbon emissions compared to direct smaller model data generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses cost, emissions, and performance issues in language model training.

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction, addressing the scarcity of annotated corpora in zero-shot/few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, high-quality annotated corpora are scarce for document-level entity and relation extraction, especially in zero-shot or few-shot settings.

Method: Combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning using a reasoning-optimized language model, avoiding manual annotation.

Result: Produced a synthetic dataset of 5k Wikipedia abstracts with 59k entities and 30k relation triples. Evaluated on DocIE shared task, showing challenges in zero-shot document-level extraction.

Conclusion: In-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, even with synthetic data and retrieval-based learning.

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A conditional multistage failure recovery framework using zero-shot chain prompting improves task execution for embodied agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents often face execution failures, necessitating robust recovery mechanisms.

Method: The framework has four error-handling stages (three during execution, one post-execution) and leverages LLMs for contextual reasoning and solution generation.

Result: Outperforms baseline by 11.5% and existing models by 19% on the TfD benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses execution failures, enhancing agent performance.

Abstract: Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution
failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In
this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how data entropy correlates with memorization in LLMs, introducing the Entropy-Memorization Law and demonstrating its use for dataset inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the difficulty of memorizing training data in LLMs, focusing on the relationship between data entropy and memorization.

Method: Empirical experiments on OLMo models, analyzing entropy and memorization scores, and testing on randomized strings ('gibberish').

Result: Found a linear correlation between data entropy and memorization score, with gibberish showing lower empirical entropy than expected.

Conclusion: The Entropy-Memorization Law provides a framework for understanding memorization in LLMs and enables practical applications like dataset inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore parameter-efficient methods for adapting language models without modifying their core parameters, focusing on prompt tuning.

Method: Classifies approaches into direct prompt learning (general optimization, encoder-based, decomposition, mixture-of-experts) and transfer learning (general transfer, encoder-based, decomposition). Analyzes designs, innovations, and trade-offs.

Abstract: This survey reviews prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting language models by prepending trainable continuous vectors while
keeping the model frozen. We classify existing approaches into two categories:
direct prompt learning and transfer learning. Direct prompt learning methods
include: general optimization approaches, encoder-based methods, decomposition
strategies, and mixture-of-experts frameworks. Transfer learning methods
consist of: general transfer approaches, encoder-based methods, and
decomposition strategies. For each method, we analyze method designs,
innovations, insights, advantages, and disadvantages, with illustrative
visualizations comparing different frameworks. We identify challenges in
computational efficiency and training stability, and discuss future directions
in improving training robustness and broadening application scope.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeoBabel is a multilingual text-to-image generation framework supporting six languages, outperforming existing models while being smaller and more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the English-centric bias in text-to-image generation, which creates barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuates digital inequities.

Method: Combines large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning, evaluated on expanded benchmarks (m-GenEval and m-DPG).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance (0.75 on m-GenEval, 0.68 on m-DPG) and matches English-only models while being 2-4x smaller.

Conclusion: Multilingual capability enhances robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI, demonstrated by NeoBabel's superior performance and inclusivity.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Code Triangle framework to evaluate LLMs in code generation, revealing gaps in diversity and robustness compared to humans. It suggests human input and model mixtures can improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess LLMs' programming competence, which remains underexplored despite their progress in code generation.

Method: The Code Triangle framework evaluates LLMs across editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation using competitive programming benchmarks.

Result: LLMs form a self-consistent system but lack human-like diversity and robustness. Human input and model mixtures enhance performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' cognitive gaps and proposes human collaboration and self-reflection as paths to more powerful coding models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Motivation: To enhance visual reasoning by leveraging text-only LLMs and improve cross-modal alignment without additional pre-training.

Method: Uses a post-training RL framework to activate reasoning skills, introduces a connector module for cross-modal alignment, and employs entropy of critical reasoning tokens for checkpoint selection.

Result: Achieves 76.0% on MMMU, matching entry-level human performance, and rivals closed-source VLMs with a 38B parameter model.

Conclusion: Skywork-R1V3 demonstrates RL's potential for advancing open-source VLMs, showcasing robust cross-modal reasoning and transferability of skills.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CriticLean introduces a critic-guided reinforcement learning framework to improve semantic fidelity in translating natural language math statements to formal code, outperforming baselines and providing a new benchmark and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of focus on the critic phase in automated theorem proving, which evaluates if formalizations truly capture the original problem's intent.

Method: Proposes CriticLeanGPT (trained via supervised fine-tuning and RL) and CriticLeanBench (a benchmark), then builds FineLeanCorpus (a dataset).

Result: CriticLeanGPT outperforms baselines; FineLeanCorpus includes 285K diverse and high-correctness problems.

Conclusion: Optimizing the critic phase is key for reliable formalizations, and CriticLean offers insights for future formal math reasoning.

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: To enhance subjectivity detection in news text by leveraging transfer-learning and controlled data augmentation.

Method: Contrasts fine-tuning pre-trained encoders with transfer-learning of fine-tuned transformers. Uses GPT-4o for stylistic data augmentation and label refinement.

Result: Specialized encoders outperform general-purpose ones, and curated augmentation boosts robustness, especially for subjective content. Ranked 16th out of 24.

Conclusion: Combining encoder specialization and label-consistent augmentation improves subjectivity detection.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates strategies for automated fact-checking of numerical claims, focusing on evidence retrieval and tokenization methods, finding that neither R2L tokenization nor longer context windows improve performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical claims present unique challenges for automated fact-checking, and the study aims to improve veracity prediction for such claims.

Method: The study uses the QuanTemp dataset and a custom evidence retrieval pipeline to test the impact of longer context windows, R2L tokenization, and their combination on classification performance.

Result: R2L tokenization and longer context windows did not improve performance, with evidence quality being the main bottleneck. The best system achieved a macro-average F1 score of 0.57, ranking Top-4 in CheckThat! 2025.

Conclusion: Evidence quality is more critical than tokenization or context length for numerical claim verification, and the study provides a competitive baseline for future work.

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

Motivation: To address the limitations of explicit CoT reasoning in LLMs, which relies on natural language and restricts expressive bandwidth, by exploring latent reasoning methods.

Method: The survey examines neural network layers as reasoning substrates, diverse latent reasoning techniques (e.g., activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation), and advanced paradigms like infinite-depth reasoning via masked diffusion models.

Result: The paper provides a unified overview of latent reasoning methodologies, highlighting their potential to improve LLM cognition and reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning offers a promising alternative to CoT, with future research directions aimed at advancing LLM capabilities through continuous hidden state inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of scientific discourse in tweets for the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Task 4a.

Method: Three approaches: transformer finetuning, few-shot prompting of LLMs, and an ensemble model.

Result: Achieved a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.8611, outperforming the baseline (0.8375).

Conclusion: The ensemble model, informed by experiments, proved effective, securing 7th place in the competition.

Abstract: In this paper, we, as the DS@GT team for CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Task 4a
Scientific Web Discourse Detection, present the methods we explored for this
task. For this multiclass classification task, we determined if a tweet
contained a scientific claim, a reference to a scientific study or publication,
and/or mentions of scientific entities, such as a university or a scientist. We
present 3 modeling approaches for this task: transformer finetuning, few-shot
prompting of LLMs, and a combined ensemble model whose design was informed by
earlier experiments. Our team placed 7th in the competition, achieving a
macro-averaged F1 score of 0.8611, an improvement over the DeBERTaV3 baseline
of 0.8375. Our code is available on Github at

### [249] [Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06223)
*Zhiyuan Peng,Ting-ruen Wei,Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces E²R-FLOPs, new metrics (RPP and QPP) for evaluating LLM-based rerankers, addressing inefficiency in existing proxy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficiency metrics for LLM-based rerankers are hardware-dependent and fail to account for model size, making trade-offs unclear.

Method: Proposes E²R-FLOPs (RPP and QPP) and an FLOPs estimator for hardware-agnostic evaluation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments evaluate LLM-based rerankers, highlighting efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs.

Conclusion: The new metrics provide clearer evaluation and highlight the need for better efficiency in LLM-based reranking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

TL;DR: Agent KB is a hierarchical experience framework improving language agents' error correction and cross-domain experience reuse via a Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline, boosting success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language agents struggle with error correction and reusing experiences across domains, limiting their problem-solving capabilities.

Method: Agent KB uses a Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline to create a shared knowledge base, enabling cross-agent knowledge transfer.

Result: Success rates improved by up to 16.28 percentage points on GAIA, with notable gains for Claude-3 and GPT-4. Code repair performance also improved.

Conclusion: Agent KB offers a modular, framework-agnostic solution for agents to learn from past experiences and generalize strategies to new tasks.

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.
