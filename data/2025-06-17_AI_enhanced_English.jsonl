While post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques\neffectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on\nstatic quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads.\nTo address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework\nthat optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging\nmodel perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant\nenables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically\nadjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision\nrequirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained\nprecision management.

However,\nthese large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from\nmultiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach\nfails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video\ndurations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature\nsignificance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require\nsignificant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them\nimpractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model\nperformance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our\nframework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of\nembeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS).

Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our\nmethod enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)\nand instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between\nfreezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or\nadapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning\nperformance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained\nknowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,\nour method exhibits faster convergence, \\emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,\nand improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong\nbaseline methods.

This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,\nfine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.\nThese capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.\nRecently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as\na large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance\ncomparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x\nacceleration in inference speed.\n  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven\nby progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs\nand MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and\nfoundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing\ndomain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete\ndiffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and\ndMLLMs research in early 2025.\n  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM\nand dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs,\nformalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative\nmodels. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and\nsummarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and\nbiological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research\nand deployment.\n  Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey", "AI": {"tldr": "A survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs), highlighting their advantages over autoregressive models, including parallel generation and faster inference.", "motivation": "To systematically review and categorize the advancements in dLLMs and dMLLMs, driven by progress in autoregressive models and discrete diffusion mathematics.", "method": "The paper traces historical development, formalizes mathematical frameworks, categorizes models, and analyzes training/inference techniques.", "result": "dLLMs and dMLLMs achieve performance comparable to autoregressive models with up to 10x faster inference, enabling new applications.", "conclusion": "The survey outlines future research directions and deployment opportunities for dLLMs and dMLLMs."}}

Preprint. Work in Progress", "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.\nDespite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of\nabsolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero\nbut unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient\nmodel capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss\nvalue for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the\noptimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,\nand develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant\nscalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this\ntool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of\nmainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training\nschedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B\nparameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting\nthe optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled\nsetting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes estimating the optimal loss value for diffusion models to improve training diagnosis and performance, deriving it in closed form and developing scalable estimators.", "motivation": "The optimal loss value in diffusion models is unknown and not zero, causing confusion between model capacity and training quality.
