### [1] ['Memory States' from Almost Nothing: Representing and Computing in a Non-associative Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13768)
*Stefan Reimann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A non-associative algebraic framework for high-dimensional information representation and computation, maintaining temporal order without auxiliary structures, and replicating cognitive effects like recency and primacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of order information in associative bundling models and provide a framework consistent with cognitive science findings on memory.

Method: Uses non-associative multiplication-like binding and interference-like bundling, creating L-states (recency) and R-states (primacy) for sequence representation.

Result: Sparse representations of sequences with preserved temporal structure, replicating the Serial Position Curve (recency and primacy effects).

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust method for sequence representation in cognitive tasks, linking to prefrontal cortex and hippocampal activity, with retrieval accuracy based on mutual information.

Abstract: This note presents a non-associative algebraic framework for the representation and computation of information items in high-dimensional space. This framework is consistent with the principles of spatial computing and with the empirical findings in cognitive science about memory. Computations are performed through a process of multiplication-like binding and non-associative interference-like bundling. Models that rely on associative bundling typically lose order information, which necessitates the use of auxiliary order structures, such as position markers, to represent sequential information that is important for cognitive tasks. In contrast, the non-associative bundling proposed allows the construction of sparse representations of arbitrarily long sequences that maintain their temporal structure across arbitrary lengths. In this operation, noise is a constituent element of the representation of order information, rather than a means of obscuring it. The non-associative nature of the proposed framework results in the representation of a single sequence by two distinct states. The L-state, generated through left-associative bundling, continuously updates and emphasises a recency effect, while the R-state, formed through right-associative bundling, encodes finite sequences or chunks, capturing a primacy effect. The construction of these states may be associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex in relation to short-term memory and hippocampal encoding in long-term memory, respectively. The accuracy of retrieval is contingent upon a decision-making process that is based on the mutual information between the memory states and the cue. The model is able to replicate the Serial Position Curve, which reflects the empirical recency and primacy effects observed in cognitive experiments.

### [2] [Representing Time-Continuous Behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13773)
*Milapji Singh Gill,Tom Jeleniewski,Felix Gehlhoff,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular semantic model and a method for integrating differential equations into knowledge graphs for CPS applications, validated in aviation maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reusable ontological artifacts and methods for integrating differential equations into knowledge graphs for CPS applications.

Method: Introduces a modular semantic model and a method for efficient knowledge graph generation.

Result: Validated in aviation maintenance, showing successful formal representation and contextualization of differential equations.

Conclusion: The artifacts are practically applicable for integrating differential equations with lifecycle data in CPS.

Abstract: Time-continuous dynamic models are essential for various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications. To ensure effective usability in different lifecycle phases, such behavioral information in the form of differential equations must be contextualized and integrated with further CPS information. While knowledge graphs provide a formal description and structuring mechanism for this task, there is a lack of reusable ontological artifacts and methods to reduce manual instantiation effort. Hence, this contribution introduces two artifacts: Firstly, a modular semantic model based on standards is introduced to represent differential equations directly within knowledge graphs and to enrich them semantically. Secondly, a method for efficient knowledge graph generation is presented. A validation of these artifacts was conducted in the domain of aviation maintenance. Results show that differential equations of a complex Electro-Hydraulic Servoactuator can be formally represented in a knowledge graph and be contextualized with other lifecycle data, proving the artifacts' practical applicability.

### [3] [Personalized Constitutionally-Aligned Agentic Superego: Secure AI Behavior Aligned to Diverse Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13774)
*Nell Watson,Ahmed Amer,Evan Harris,Preeti Ravindra,Shujun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'superego' agent for aligning agentic AI systems with human values, reducing harmful outputs by up to 98.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in aligning autonomous AI with diverse human values, safety, and compliance needs hinder practical deployment.

Method: A 'superego' agent uses 'Creed Constitutions' and real-time compliance enforcement to steer AI planning dynamically.

Result: Achieves up to 98.3% harm score reduction and near-perfect refusal rates for leading LLMs.

Conclusion: The Superego agent simplifies personalized AI alignment, improving safety and contextual attunement.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, possessing capabilities for autonomous planning and action, exhibit immense potential across diverse domains. However, their practical deployment is significantly hampered by challenges in aligning their behavior with varied human values, complex safety requirements, and specific compliance needs. Existing alignment methodologies often falter when faced with the intricate task of providing deep, personalized contextual information without inducing confabulation or operational inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel solution: a 'superego' agent, designed as a personalized oversight mechanism for agentic AI. This system dynamically steers AI planning by referencing user-selected "Creed Constitutions"-encapsulating diverse rule sets-with adjustable adherence levels to fit non-negotiable values. A real-time compliance enforcer validates plans against these constitutions and a universal ethical floor before execution. We present a functional system, including a demonstration interface (www.Creed.Space) with a prototypical constitution-sharing portal, and successful integration with third-party models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations (HarmBench, AgentHarm) demonstrate that our Superego agent dramatically reduces harmful outputs, achieving up to a 98.3% harm score reduction and near-perfect refusal rates (e.g., 100% with Claude Sonnet 4 on AgentHarm's harmful set) for leading LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4o. This approach substantially simplifies personalized AI alignment, rendering agentic systems more reliably attuned to individual and cultural contexts, while also enabling substantial safety improvements. An overview on this research with examples is available at https://superego.creed.space.

### [4] [Recommendations and Reporting Checklist for Rigorous & Transparent Human Baselines in Model Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13776)
*Kevin L. Wei,Patricia Paskov,Sunishchal Dev,Michael J. Byun,Anka Reuel,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Rachel Calcott,Evie Coxon,Chinmay Deshpande*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for stricter and more transparent human baselines in AI evaluations to ensure accurate comparisons between human and AI performance, offering a framework and checklist for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human baselines are crucial for interpreting AI performance, but current methods lack rigor and transparency, leading to unreliable claims of 'super-human' AI.

Method: The authors conduct a meta-review of literature to develop a framework and checklist for designing, executing, and reporting human baselines, then apply it to review 115 studies.

Result: The review identifies shortcomings in existing baselining methods, and the checklist aids researchers in improving their practices.

Conclusion: The work aims to promote more rigorous AI evaluations, benefiting both the research community and policymakers.

Abstract: In this position paper, we argue that human baselines in foundation model evaluations must be more rigorous and more transparent to enable meaningful comparisons of human vs. AI performance, and we provide recommendations and a reporting checklist towards this end. Human performance baselines are vital for the machine learning community, downstream users, and policymakers to interpret AI evaluations. Models are often claimed to achieve "super-human" performance, but existing baselining methods are neither sufficiently rigorous nor sufficiently well-documented to robustly measure and assess performance differences. Based on a meta-review of the measurement theory and AI evaluation literatures, we derive a framework with recommendations for designing, executing, and reporting human baselines. We synthesize our recommendations into a checklist that we use to systematically review 115 human baselines (studies) in foundation model evaluations and thus identify shortcomings in existing baselining methods; our checklist can also assist researchers in conducting human baselines and reporting results. We hope our work can advance more rigorous AI evaluation practices that can better serve both the research community and policymakers.

### [5] [The NordDRG AI Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13790)
*Tapio Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NordDRG-AI-Benchmark is the first public test-bed for evaluating LLMs on DRG-based hospital funding tasks, revealing domain-specific performance gaps among top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open benchmarks for LLMs in clinical coding and decision support, specifically targeting DRG-based hospital funding.

Method: The benchmark includes definition tables, expert manuals, and a prompt pack with 14 CaseMix tasks to evaluate LLMs on multilingual diagnosis, procedure, and tariff logic.

Result: Five LLMs showed varied performance: o3 scored 9/9, GPT-4o and o4-mini-high scored 7/9, while Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash scored 5/9 and 3/9, respectively.

Conclusion: NordDRG-AI-Benchmark effectively uncovers domain-specific LLM strengths and weaknesses, providing a reproducible baseline for research in hospital funding automation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are already being piloted for clinical coding and decision support. However, until now, no open benchmark has targeted the hospital funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) determine reimbursement across many countries. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first public test-bed that captures a complete DRG rule set and evaluates an LLM's ability to reason over multilingual diagnosis, procedure, and tariff logic.
  The benchmark bundles three classes of artefacts: (i) definition tables with 20 interlinked tables covering DRG logic, ICD and NCSP codes, age/sex splits, and country flags; (ii) expert manuals and changelog templates describing real governance workflows; and (iii) a prompt pack of 14 CaseMix tasks that span code lookup, cross-table inference, multilingual terminology, and quality-assurance audits.
  All artefacts are available at: https://github.com/longshoreforrest/norddrg-ai-benchmark
  A baseline demonstration shows that five state-of-the-art LLMs perform very differently on the nine automatically verifiable tasks: o3 (OpenAI) scores 9 out of 9, GPT-4o and o4-mini-high score 7 out of 9, while Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash solve only 5 out of 9 and 3 out of 9, respectively. These results confirm that NordDRG-AI-Benchmark highlights domain-specific strengths and weaknesses that remain hidden in generic LLM benchmarks, offering a reproducible baseline for research on trustworthy automation in hospital funding.

### [6] [ICE-ID: A Novel Historical Census Data Benchmark Comparing NARS against LLMs, \& a ML Ensemble on Longitudinal Identity Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13792)
*Gonçalo Hora de Carvalho,Lazar S. Popov,Sander Kaatee,Kristinn R. Thórisson,Tangrui Li,Pétur Húni Björnsson,Jilles S. Dibangoye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICE-ID is a new benchmark dataset for historical identity resolution, covering 220 years of Icelandic census records. It evaluates methods like rule-based matchers, ML ensembles, and LLMs against NARS, a novel AI framework, which achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a large-scale, open dataset for studying long-term person-entity matching in real-world populations, addressing gaps in historical data linkage.

Method: The study introduces ICE-ID, defines identity resolution tasks, and evaluates methods including rule-based matchers, ML ensembles, LLMs, and NARS (a Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System).

Result: NARS performs competitively, achieving state-of-the-art results in identity resolution tasks.

Conclusion: ICE-ID enables reproducible benchmarking and opens new research avenues in data linkage and historical analytics.

Abstract: We introduce ICE-ID, a novel benchmark dataset for historical identity resolution, comprising 220 years (1703-1920) of Icelandic census records. ICE-ID spans multiple generations of longitudinal data, capturing name variations, demographic changes, and rich genealogical links. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, open tabular dataset specifically designed to study long-term person-entity matching in a real-world population. We define identity resolution tasks (within and across census waves) with clearly documented metrics and splits. We evaluate a range of methods: handcrafted rule-based matchers, a ML ensemble as well as LLMs for structured data (e.g. transformer-based tabular networks) against a novel approach to tabular data called NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) - a general-purpose AI framework designed to reason with limited knowledge and resources. Its core is Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL), a term-based logic. Our experiments show that NARS is suprisingly simple and competitive with other standard approaches, achieving SOTA at our task. By releasing ICE-ID and our code, we enable reproducible benchmarking of identity resolution approaches in longitudinal settings and hope that ICE-ID opens new avenues for cross-disciplinary research in data linkage and historical analytics.

### [7] [Med-REFL: Medical Reasoning Enhancement via Self-Corrected Fine-grained Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13793)
*Zongxian Yang,Jiayu Qian,Zegao Peng,Haoyu Zhang,Zhi-An Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Med-REFL enhances medical reasoning by decomposing questions into fine-grained steps, evaluating reflections, and optimizing preferences, achieving up to 4.11% improvement on MedQA-USMLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large reasoning models underperform in medical domains due to poor intermediate reflection quality, critical for high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Uses a tree-of-thought approach to break down medical questions, evaluates reasoning steps, and constructs preference optimization data automatically.

Result: Achieves 4.11% average improvement on MedQA-USMLE and boosts 7B/8B models by 4.13%. Shows strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Focusing on reflection quality improves accuracy and trustworthiness in medical AI, as demonstrated by Med-REFL.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have recently made significant strides in mathematical and code reasoning, yet their success has not transferred smoothly to the medical domain. While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications.

### [8] [BotTrans: A Multi-Source Graph Domain Adaptation Approach for Social Bot Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13795)
*Boshen Shi,Yongqing Wang,Fangda Guo,Jiangli Shao,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes BotTrans, a multi-source graph domain adaptation model, to address label scarcity in detecting social bots by leveraging knowledge from multiple source networks, improving transfer learning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity in detecting social bots and anomalies with GNN-based models, compounded by network heterophily and single-source transfer limitations, motivates the need for a multi-source approach.

Method: BotTrans establishes a cross-source-domain topology for homophily, aggregates cross-domain neighbor information, integrates source-target relevance, and refines detection using target domain semantics.

Result: BotTrans outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments, demonstrating effective multi-source knowledge transfer for unlabeled target tasks.

Conclusion: BotTrans effectively addresses transfer learning challenges in social bot detection by leveraging multi-source domains, enhancing detection performance.

Abstract: Transferring extensive knowledge from relevant social networks has emerged as a promising solution to overcome label scarcity in detecting social bots and other anomalies with GNN-based models. However, effective transfer faces two critical challenges. Firstly, the network heterophily problem, which is caused by bots hiding malicious behaviors via indiscriminately interacting with human users, hinders the model's ability to learn sufficient and accurate bot-related knowledge from source domains. Secondly, single-source transfer might lead to inferior and unstable results, as the source network may embody weak relevance to the task and provide limited knowledge. To address these challenges, we explore multiple source domains and propose a multi-source graph domain adaptation model named \textit{BotTrans}. We initially leverage the labeling knowledge shared across multiple source networks to establish a cross-source-domain topology with increased network homophily. We then aggregate cross-domain neighbor information to enhance the discriminability of source node embeddings. Subsequently, we integrate the relevance between each source-target pair with model optimization, which facilitates knowledge transfer from source networks that are more relevant to the detection task. Additionally, we propose a refinement strategy to improve detection performance by utilizing semantic knowledge within the target domain. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textit{BotTrans} outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, revealing its efficacy in leveraging multi-source knowledge when the target detection task is unlabeled.

All algorithms are implemented efficiently in Python and validated using cloud-based execution on Google Colab Pro+.

### [10] [Causality in the human niche: lessons for machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13803)
*Richard D. Lange,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the gap between human causal cognition and machine learning systems, emphasizing the need for more human-like causal models to improve AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning systems lack human-like causal understanding, which limits their generalization and learning efficiency. The Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, while useful, doesn't fully capture human causal cognition.

Method: The paper explores the differences between human causal cognition and SCMs, focusing on how humans generalize causal knowledge through analogies and adapt to their niche.

Result: SCMs fall short in representing human-like causal reasoning, particularly in generalization and analogy-making. Human causal cognition is better suited for real-world, social, and goal-driven contexts.

Conclusion: Future AI systems should incorporate human-like causal inductive biases to enhance capability, controllability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Humans interpret the world around them in terms of cause and effect and communicate their understanding of the world to each other in causal terms. These causal aspects of human cognition are thought to underlie humans' ability to generalize and learn efficiently in new domains, an area where current machine learning systems are weak. Building human-like causal competency into machine learning systems may facilitate the construction of effective and interpretable AI. Indeed, the machine learning community has been importing ideas on causality formalized by the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, which provides a rigorous formal language for many aspects of causality and has led to significant advances. However, the SCM framework fails to capture some salient aspects of human causal cognition and has likewise not yet led to advances in machine learning in certain critical areas where humans excel. We contend that the problem of causality in the ``human niche'' -- for a social, autonomous, and goal-driven agent sensing and acting in the world in which humans live -- is quite different from the kind of causality captured by SCMs. For example, everyday objects come in similar types that have similar causal properties, and so humans readily generalize knowledge of one type of object (cups) to another related type (bowls) by drawing causal analogies between objects with similar properties, but such analogies are at best awkward to express in SCMs. We explore how such causal capabilities are adaptive in, and motivated by, the human niche. By better appreciating properties of human causal cognition and, crucially, how those properties are adaptive in the niche in which humans live, we hope that future work at the intersection of machine learning and causality will leverage more human-like inductive biases to create more capable, controllable, and interpretable systems.

### [11] [Bridging Pattern-Aware Complexity with NP-Hard Optimization: A Unifying Framework and Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13810)
*Olivier Saidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework leverages structural patterns in NP-hard problems like TSP to reduce computational complexity, achieving up to 79% solution quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world instances of NP-hard problems often have exploitable patterns, unlike worst-case scenarios.

Method: Proposes a pattern-aware complexity framework with metrics like PUE and a meta-learning solver pipeline.

Result: Achieves up to 79% solution quality gains in TSP benchmarks (22 to 2392 cities).

Conclusion: Offers a practical, unified approach for pattern-driven efficiency, distinct from theoretical NP-hardness.

Abstract: NP hard optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defy efficient solutions in the worst case, yet real-world instances often exhibit exploitable patterns. We propose a novel patternaware complexity framework that quantifies and leverages structural regularities e.g., clustering, symmetry to reduce effective computational complexity across domains, including financial forecasting and LLM optimization. With rigorous definitions, theorems, and a meta learning driven solver pipeline, we introduce metrics like Pattern Utilization Efficiency (PUE) and achieve up to 79 percent solution quality gains in TSP benchmarks (22 to 2392 cities). Distinct from theoretical NP hardness, our approach offers a unified, practical lens for pattern-driven efficiency.

### [12] [The Reflexive Integrated Information Unit: A Differentiable Primitive for Artificial Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13825)
*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan,Issa Karambal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reflexive Integrated Information Unit (RIIU), a trainable module for artificial consciousness research, designed to be small, benchmarkable, and improvable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a foundational, trainable module in artificial consciousness research, akin to the perceptron in neural networks.

Method: RIIU augments its hidden state with a meta-state and broadcast buffer, using a sliding-window covariance and differentiable Auto-$Φ$ surrogate to maximize local information integration.

Result: RIIUs are differentiable, compose additively, and show $Φ$-monotone plasticity. In tests, a four-layer RIIU agent outperformed a GRU in recovering from actuator failure.

Conclusion: RIIUs transform the philosophical debate on consciousness into an empirical, mathematical problem by scaling down consciousness-like computation.

Abstract: Research on artificial consciousness lacks the equivalent of the perceptron: a small, trainable module that can be copied, benchmarked, and iteratively improved. We introduce the Reflexive Integrated Information Unit (RIIU), a recurrent cell that augments its hidden state $h$ with two additional vectors: (i) a meta-state $μ$ that records the cell's own causal footprint, and (ii) a broadcast buffer $B$ that exposes that footprint to the rest of the network. A sliding-window covariance and a differentiable Auto-$Φ$ surrogate let each RIIU maximize local information integration online. We prove that RIIUs (1) are end-to-end differentiable, (2) compose additively, and (3) perform $Φ$-monotone plasticity under gradient ascent. In an eight-way Grid-world, a four-layer RIIU agent restores $>90\%$ reward within 13 steps after actuator failure, twice as fast as a parameter-matched GRU, while maintaining a non-zero Auto-$Φ$ signal. By shrinking "consciousness-like" computation down to unit scale, RIIUs turn a philosophical debate into an empirical mathematical problem.

### [13] [LocationReasoner: Evaluating LLMs on Real-World Site Selection Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13841)
*Miho Koda,Yu Zheng,Ruixian Ma,Mingyang Sun,Devesh Pansare,Fabio Duarte,Paolo Santi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LocationReasoner, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' reasoning in real-world site selection, revealing limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs' reasoning skills generalize to complex real-world scenarios, beyond domains like math and coding.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 300+ queries and a sandbox environment for constraint-based location search, testing models like OpenAI o4.

Result: State-of-the-art models show limited improvement, with OpenAI o4 failing 30% of tasks; agentic strategies like ReAct underperform.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with holistic, non-linear reasoning in real-world tasks; LocationReasoner is released to advance robust reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly those enhanced through reinforced post-training, have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, as exemplified by models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation -- leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex, real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistical constraints. The benchmark comprises over 300 carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels, supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Extensive evaluations reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct code-generation prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks. Codes and data for our benchmark are available at https://github.com/miho-koda/LocationReasoner.

*Miguel A. Lago,Ghada Zamzmi,Brandon Eich,Jana G. Delfino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate AI explainability using four criteria: Consistency, Plausibility, Fidelity, and Usefulness, and applies it to medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of techniques to assess the quality of AI explanations, especially in critical fields like healthcare.

Method: The authors introduce a framework with four evaluation criteria and develop a scorecard for AI explainability methods, demonstrated using Ablation CAM and Eigen CAM on synthetic mammographies.

Result: The framework provides a structured way to assess explanation quality, with examples in breast lesion detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework aims to improve AI explainability evaluation and foster better development of AI-based medical devices.

Abstract: Explainability features are intended to provide insight into the internal mechanisms of an AI device, but there is a lack of evaluation techniques for assessing the quality of provided explanations. We propose a framework to assess and report explainable AI features. Our evaluation framework for AI explainability is based on four criteria: 1) Consistency quantifies the variability of explanations to similar inputs, 2) Plausibility estimates how close the explanation is to the ground truth, 3) Fidelity assesses the alignment between the explanation and the model internal mechanisms, and 4) Usefulness evaluates the impact on task performance of the explanation. Finally, we developed a scorecard for AI explainability methods that serves as a complete description and evaluation to accompany this type of algorithm. We describe these four criteria and give examples on how they can be evaluated. As a case study, we use Ablation CAM and Eigen CAM to illustrate the evaluation of explanation heatmaps on the detection of breast lesions on synthetic mammographies. The first three criteria are evaluated for clinically-relevant scenarios. Our proposed framework establishes criteria through which the quality of explanations provided by AI models can be evaluated. We intend for our framework to spark a dialogue regarding the value provided by explainability features and help improve the development and evaluation of AI-based medical devices.

*Mbithe Nzomo,Deshendran Moodley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel approach integrates knowledge graphs and Bayesian networks for explainable disease risk prediction using multimodal EHR data, balancing general medical knowledge with patient-specific context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt general medical knowledge for specific healthcare settings and patient populations, while handling uncertainty and ensuring explainability in disease risk prediction.

Method: Constructs Bayesian networks from ontology-based knowledge graphs and multimodal EHR data.

Result: The approach effectively balances general and patient-specific knowledge, handles uncertainty, is explainable, and achieves good predictive performance in atrial fibrillation prediction.

Conclusion: Integration of knowledge graphs and Bayesian networks offers a robust solution for explainable and accurate disease risk prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data is useful for disease risk prediction based on medical domain knowledge. However, general medical knowledge must be adapted to specific healthcare settings and patient populations to achieve practical clinical use. Additionally, risk prediction systems must handle uncertainty from incomplete data and non-deterministic health outcomes while remaining explainable. These challenges can be alleviated by the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) and Bayesian networks (BNs). We present a novel approach for constructing BNs from ontology-based KGs and multimodal EHR data for explainable disease risk prediction. Through an application use case of atrial fibrillation and real-world EHR data, we demonstrate that the approach balances generalised medical knowledge with patient-specific context, effectively handles uncertainty, is highly explainable, and achieves good predictive performance.

Motivation: Existing chatbot personalization methods rely on static or self-reported user data, lacking adaptability to evolving user proficiency.

Method: ProfiLLM uses a domain-adaptable taxonomy and LLM-based profiling, demonstrated in ITSec with synthetic user conversations.

Result: ProfiLLM[ITSec] reduced the gap between actual and predicted proficiency scores by 55-65% after one prompt, with further refinement.

Conclusion: ProfiLLM offers effective implicit profiling, supported by a new simulation methodology, taxonomy, and dataset for future research.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in conversational AI, large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots often struggle with personalizing their responses according to individual user characteristics, such as technical expertise, learning style, and communication preferences. This lack of personalization is particularly problematic in specialized knowledge-intense domains like IT/cybersecurity (ITSec), where user knowledge levels vary widely. Existing approaches for chatbot personalization primarily rely on static user categories or explicit self-reported information, limiting their adaptability to an evolving perception of the user's proficiency, obtained in the course of ongoing interactions. In this paper, we propose ProfiLLM, a novel framework for implicit and dynamic user profiling through chatbot interactions. This framework consists of a taxonomy that can be adapted for use in diverse domains and an LLM-based method for user profiling in terms of the taxonomy. To demonstrate ProfiLLM's effectiveness, we apply it in the ITSec domain where troubleshooting interactions are used to infer chatbot users' technical proficiency. Specifically, we developed ProfiLLM[ITSec], an ITSec-adapted variant of ProfiLLM, and evaluated its performance on 1,760 human-like chatbot conversations from 263 synthetic users. Results show that ProfiLLM[ITSec] rapidly and accurately infers ITSec profiles, reducing the gap between actual and predicted scores by up to 55--65\% after a single prompt, followed by minor fluctuations and further refinement. In addition to evaluating our new implicit and dynamic profiling framework, we also propose an LLM-based persona simulation methodology, a structured taxonomy for ITSec proficiency, our codebase, and a dataset of chatbot interactions to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for complex and automatic Hardware Assertion Generation, improving efficiency and robustness in SVA creation.

Method: A three-stage approach: 1) Multi-modal specification processing with LLM agents, 2) Monte Carlo Tree Self-Refine (MCTSr) for SVA reasoning, 3) Combining traces to generate SVAs.

Result: SANGAM generates robust SVAs, performing better in evaluations than recent methods.

Conclusion: SANGAM effectively automates SVA generation, showcasing the potential of LLMs in hardware verification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new possibilities for more complex and automatic Hardware Assertion Generation techniques. This paper introduces SANGAM, a SystemVerilog Assertion Generation framework using LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for the automatic generation of SVAs from industry-level specifications. The proposed framework utilizes a three-stage approach: Stage 1 consists of multi-modal Specification Processing using Signal Mapper, SPEC Analyzer, and Waveform Analyzer LLM Agents. Stage 2 consists of using the Monte Carlo Tree Self-Refine (MCTSr) algorithm for automatic reasoning about SVAs for each signal, and finally, Stage 3 combines the MCTSr-generated reasoning traces to generate SVA assertions for each signal. The results demonstrated that our framework, SANGAM, can generate a robust set of SVAs, performing better in the evaluation process in comparison to the recent methods.

TL;DR: The paper discusses 'machine mirages,' a new class of cognitive aberrations in multimodal AI systems, and emphasizes the need for their explicit definition and systematic assessment to improve reliability and ethical AI ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and analyze the emerging cognitive errors in AI systems that mimic human or animal fallibility but are distinct, aiming to improve AI reliability and ethical considerations.

Method: The article presents and categorizes various machine mirages, such as delusion, hallucination, and bias amplification, and argues for their systematic study.

Result: Identifies a range of machine mirages, demonstrating their impact on AI performance and ethical implications.

Conclusion: Understanding and addressing machine mirages is crucial for advancing reliable AI and fostering an ethical, co-evolving intelligence ecosystem.

Abstract: As multimodal machine intelligence systems started achieving average animal-level and average human-level fluency in many measurable tasks in processing images, language, and sound, they began to exhibit a new class of cognitive aberrations: machine mirages. These include delusion, illusion, confabulation, hallucination, misattribution error, semantic drift, semantic compression, exaggeration, causal inference failure, uncanny valley of perception, bluffing-patter-bullshitting, cognitive stereotypy, pragmatic misunderstanding, hypersignification, semantic reheating-warming, simulated authority effect, fallacious abductive leap, contextual drift, referential hallucination, semiotic Frankenstein effect, calibration failure, spurious correlation, bias amplification, concept drift sensitivity, misclassification under uncertainty, adversarial vulnerability, overfitting, prosodic misclassification, accent bias, turn boundary failure, semantic boundary confusion, noise overfitting, latency-induced decision drift, ambiguity collapse and other forms of error that mimic but do not replicate human or animal fallibility. This article presents some of the errors and argues that these failures must be explicitly defined and systematically assessed. Understanding machine mirages is essential not only for improving machine intelligence reliability but also for constructing a multiscale ethical, co-evolving intelligence ecosystem that respects the diverse forms of life, cognition, and expression it will inevitably touch.

Motivation: To address the challenge of developing AI agents capable of exploring, planning, and learning in open-ended environments by leveraging HRL.

Method: The paper reviews HRL methods for discovering temporal structure, including online learning, offline datasets, and LLMs.

Result: Identifies benefits of HRL in decision-making and performance trade-offs, along with suitable domains for temporal structure discovery.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of HRL while acknowledging challenges in defining and discovering useful temporal structures.

Abstract: Developing agents capable of exploring, planning and learning in complex open-ended environments is a grand challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) offers a promising solution to this challenge by discovering and exploiting the temporal structure within a stream of experience. The strong appeal of the HRL framework has led to a rich and diverse body of literature attempting to discover a useful structure. However, it is still not clear how one might define what constitutes good structure in the first place, or the kind of problems in which identifying it may be helpful. This work aims to identify the benefits of HRL from the perspective of the fundamental challenges in decision-making, as well as highlight its impact on the performance trade-offs of AI agents. Through these benefits, we then cover the families of methods that discover temporal structure in HRL, ranging from learning directly from online experience to offline datasets, to leveraging large language models (LLMs). Finally, we highlight the challenges of temporal structure discovery and the domains that are particularly well-suited for such endeavours.

TL;DR: CaLLiPer, a multimodal framework, enhances location prediction by combining spatial and semantic data, outperforming traditional methods, especially for new locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional location prediction methods lack spatial explicitness and semantic context, limiting their effectiveness for unseen locations.

Method: CaLLiPer uses contrastive learning to fuse spatial coordinates and semantic features of points of interest for robust location embeddings.

Result: CaLLiPer outperforms baselines in conventional and inductive settings, excelling with emerging locations.

Conclusion: Multimodal, inductive embeddings like CaLLiPer advance mobility prediction, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Predicting individuals' next locations is a core task in human mobility modelling, with wide-ranging implications for urban planning, transportation, public policy and personalised mobility services. Traditional approaches largely depend on location embeddings learned from historical mobility patterns, limiting their ability to encode explicit spatial information, integrate rich urban semantic context, and accommodate previously unseen locations. To address these challenges, we explore the application of CaLLiPer -- a multimodal representation learning framework that fuses spatial coordinates and semantic features of points of interest through contrastive learning -- for location embedding in individual mobility prediction. CaLLiPer's embeddings are spatially explicit, semantically enriched, and inductive by design, enabling robust prediction performance even in scenarios involving emerging locations. Through extensive experiments on four public mobility datasets under both conventional and inductive settings, we demonstrate that CaLLiPer consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly excelling in inductive scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal, inductive location embeddings to advance the capabilities of human mobility prediction systems. We also release the code and data (https://github.com/xlwang233/Into-the-Unknown) to foster reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: A benchmark for form-filling in image-only documents shows poor baseline performance, improved by FieldFinder tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of form-filling without OCR or text access, requiring multi-modal understanding and tool-use.

Method: Introduces a benchmark with 432 fields across 55 documents and tasks, and FieldFinder tool to assist LLMs in text placement.

Result: Baseline VLAs score <1% accuracy; GUI agents 10.6-68.0%. FieldFinder boosts performance up to 56%.

Conclusion: FieldFinder significantly improves form-filling accuracy, highlighting the need for better localization tools in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Completing paperwork is a challenging and time-consuming problem. Form filling is especially challenging in the pure-image domain without access to OCR, typeset PDF text, or a DOM. For computer agents, it requires multiple abilities, including multi-modal understanding, information retrieval, and tool-use. We present a novel form-filling benchmark consisting of 432 fields spread across 55 documents and 3 tasks, requiring knowledge of 236 features per user. We find that baseline VLAs achieve less than 1% accuracy in most cases, primarily due to poor localization ability. GUI agents also struggle, scoring between 10.6-68.0% despite high cost and latency. Therefore, we also contribute FieldFinder, a tool to assist LLMs in identifying where to place text on a form. With FieldFinder, all models achieve equal or better performance in all six study conditions, with a maximum increase from 2% to 56%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring document relevance in RAG systems without high computational costs.

Method: Finetuned a small language model (llama-3.2-1b) as a relevance grader to verify document relevance.

Result: Precision improved from 0.1301 to 0.7750, comparable to llama-3.1-70b.

Conclusion: Lightweight models can effectively enhance RAG systems by improving relevance verification efficiently.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses limitations of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a vector database to provide more accurate and up-to-date information. When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/Lightweight-Relevance-Grader-in-RAG.

TL;DR: The paper investigates positional biases in LLMs during decision-making, revealing consistent order effects, a novel centrality bias, and quality-dependent shifts. It introduces a framework to classify preferences and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically dissect and link positional order biases in LLMs to underlying preference structures, as prior work noted such biases but lacked comprehensive analysis.

Method: Comprehensive investigation across multiple LLM architectures and domains, introducing a framework to classify pairwise preferences (robust, fragile, indifferent).

Result: Strong and consistent order effects, including centrality bias and quality-dependent shifts. Positional biases are stronger than gender biases and can lead to inferior choices.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit distinct failure modes not seen in humans. Targeted mitigation strategies, like adjusting the temperature parameter, are proposed to reduce biases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-support systems across high-stakes domains such as hiring and university admissions, where decisions often involve selecting among competing alternatives. While prior work has noted positional order biases in LLM-driven comparisons, these biases have not been systematically dissected or linked to underlying preference structures. We provide the first comprehensive investigation of positional biases across multiple LLM architectures and domains, uncovering strong and consistent order effects, including a novel centrality bias not previously documented in human or machine decision-making. We also find a quality-dependent shift: when options are high quality, models exhibit primacy bias, but favor latter options when option quality is low. We further identify a previously undocumented bias favoring certain names over others. To distinguish superficial tie-breaking from true distortions of judgment, we introduce a framework that classifies pairwise preferences as robust, fragile, or indifferent. We show that order effects can lead models to select strictly inferior options, and that positional biases are typically stronger than gender biases. These findings suggest that LLMs are not merely inheriting human-like biases, but exhibit distinct failure modes not seen in human decision-making. We propose targeted mitigation strategies, including a novel use of the temperature parameter, to reduce order-driven distortions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of context-dependent resource allocation in real-world applications, where demands and priorities vary.

Method: Formalizes constraints as logic implications, uses a dynamic penalty algorithm for violations, and introduces a probabilistic selection mechanism.

Result: SCRL outperforms existing methods in constraint satisfaction and resource efficiency in medical and agricultural scenarios.

Conclusion: SCRL is effective for real-world, context-sensitive decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Sequential Resource Allocation with situational constraints presents a significant challenge in real-world applications, where resource demands and priorities are context-dependent. This paper introduces a novel framework, SCRL, to address this problem. We formalize situational constraints as logic implications and develop a new algorithm that dynamically penalizes constraint violations. To handle situational constraints effectively, we propose a probabilistic selection mechanism to overcome limitations of traditional constraint reinforcement learning (CRL) approaches. We evaluate SCRL across two scenarios: medical resource allocation during a pandemic and pesticide distribution in agriculture. Experiments demonstrate that SCRL outperforms existing baselines in satisfying constraints while maintaining high resource efficiency, showcasing its potential for real-world, context-sensitive decision-making tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vertical-domain LLMs require large annotated datasets and computational resources, hindering rapid development and iteration.

Method: CoEM builds a knowledge pool from user snippets, uses dialogues and ratings to identify high-value fragments, and injects them via prompts for lightweight adaptation.

Result: In a financial scenario, CoEM improved domain-specific generation quality with 15k user feedback, avoiding traditional fine-tuning costs.

Conclusion: CoEM offers an efficient alternative to resource-heavy fine-tuning for vertical-domain LLMs, enhancing accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Vertical-domain large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in specialized scenarios such as finance, healthcare, and law; however, their training often relies on large-scale annotated data and substantial computational resources, impeding rapid development and continuous iteration. To address these challenges, we introduce the Collaborative Editable Model (CoEM), which constructs a candidate knowledge pool from user-contributed domain snippets, leverages interactive user-model dialogues combined with user ratings and attribution analysis to pinpoint high-value knowledge fragments, and injects these fragments via in-context prompts for lightweight domain adaptation. With high-value knowledge, the LLM can generate more accurate and domain-specific content. In a financial information scenario, we collect 15k feedback from about 120 users and validate CoEM with user ratings to assess the quality of generated insights, demonstrating significant improvements in domain-specific generation while avoiding the time and compute overhead of traditional fine-tuning workflows.

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic model integrates multimodal inputs using neural networks and Bayesian inference, matching human performance in an object-guessing game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how humans flexibly integrate diverse information sources (auditory, visual, language, prior knowledge) to infer unseen objects.

Method: Proposes a neurosymbolic model: neural networks parse multimodal inputs, and a Bayesian model integrates information for hypothesis evaluation. Tested via the "What's in the Box?" game.

Result: The model strongly correlates with human judgments, outperforming unimodal and large multimodal neural baselines.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic approach effectively mimics human-like inference by combining neural parsing with Bayesian integration.

Abstract: People regularly make inferences about objects in the world that they cannot see by flexibly integrating information from multiple sources: auditory and visual cues, language, and our prior beliefs and knowledge about the scene. How are we able to so flexibly integrate many sources of information to make sense of the world around us, even if we have no direct knowledge? In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic model that uses neural networks to parse open-ended multimodal inputs and then applies a Bayesian model to integrate different sources of information to evaluate different hypotheses. We evaluate our model with a novel object guessing game called ``What's in the Box?'' where humans and models watch a video clip of an experimenter shaking boxes and then try to guess the objects inside the boxes. Through a human experiment, we show that our model correlates strongly with human judgments, whereas unimodal ablated models and large multimodal neural model baselines show poor correlation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM evaluations treat models as black boxes, lacking insight into internal mechanisms. This study aims to provide interpretable assessments of ToM in MLLMs.

Method: Constructs GridToM, a multimodal ToM test dataset, and analyzes attention heads in MLLMs to identify ToM capabilities. Proposes a lightweight, training-free approach to enhance ToM.

Result: Attention heads in MLLMs can distinguish cognitive information across perspectives, demonstrating ToM. The proposed method improves ToM performance.

Conclusion: The study offers an interpretability-driven framework for evaluating and enhancing ToM in MLLMs, bridging gaps in current black-box evaluations.

Abstract: As large language models evolve, there is growing anticipation that they will emulate human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) to assist with routine tasks. However, existing methods for evaluating machine ToM focus primarily on unimodal models and largely treat these models as black boxes, lacking an interpretative exploration of their internal mechanisms. In response, this study adopts an approach based on internal mechanisms to provide an interpretability-driven assessment of ToM in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we first construct a multimodal ToM test dataset, GridToM, which incorporates diverse belief testing tasks and perceptual information from multiple perspectives. Next, our analysis shows that attention heads in multimodal large models can distinguish cognitive information across perspectives, providing evidence of ToM capabilities. Furthermore, we present a lightweight, training-free approach that significantly enhances the model's exhibited ToM by adjusting in the direction of the attention head.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ImpReSS is an implicit recommender system for customer support conversations, integrating product recommendations without assuming user intent, showing strong performance in empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance customer support by implicitly recommending relevant solution product categories (SPCs) during interactions, addressing a gap in LLM-based conversational recommender systems.

Method: ImpReSS operates alongside support chatbots, identifying opportunities to recommend SPCs based on conversation context, without explicit user intent.

Result: Empirical results show high performance (e.g., MRR@1 of 0.72-0.85) across problem-solving, security, and cybersecurity scenarios.

Conclusion: ImpReSS effectively integrates recommendations in customer support, demonstrating potential for business growth and issue resolution, with data and code available for future research.

Abstract: Following recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), LLM-based chatbots have transformed customer support by automating interactions and providing consistent, scalable service. While LLM-based conversational recommender systems (CRSs) have attracted attention for their ability to enhance the quality of recommendations, limited research has addressed the implicit integration of recommendations within customer support interactions. In this work, we introduce ImpReSS, an implicit recommender system designed for customer support conversations. ImpReSS operates alongside existing support chatbots, where users report issues and chatbots provide solutions. Based on a customer support conversation, ImpReSS identifies opportunities to recommend relevant solution product categories (SPCs) that help resolve the issue or prevent its recurrence -- thereby also supporting business growth. Unlike traditional CRSs, ImpReSS functions entirely implicitly and does not rely on any assumption of a user's purchasing intent. Our empirical evaluation of ImpReSS's ability to recommend relevant SPCs that can help address issues raised in support conversations shows promising results, including an MRR@1 (and recall@3) of 0.72 (0.89) for general problem solving, 0.82 (0.83) for information security support, and 0.85 (0.67) for cybersecurity troubleshooting. To support future research, our data and code will be shared upon request.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI's capability in abstract causal reasoning and challenge existing views on defining causation in neuron diagrams.

Method: Uses neuron diagrams from philosophy (D. Lewis) to test LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini) and proposes a new definition of causation.

Result: LLMs correctly identify debated causes, and a broader definition of causation is introduced.

Conclusion: Future philosophical research may involve collaboration between human and AI expertise.

Abstract: We propose a test for abstract causal reasoning in AI, based on scholarship in the philosophy of causation, in particular on the neuron diagrams popularized by D. Lewis. We illustrate the test on advanced Large Language Models (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Gemini). Remarkably, these chatbots are already capable of correctly identifying causes in cases that are hotly debated in the literature. In order to assess the results of these LLMs and future dedicated AI, we propose a definition of cause in neuron diagrams with a wider validity than published hitherto, which challenges the widespread view that such a definition is elusive. We submit that these results are an illustration of how future philosophical research might evolve: as an interplay between human and artificial expertise.

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLM reasoning but underperforms on Pass@K due to flawed metrics. Introducing CoT-Pass@K fixes this, showing RLVR's true potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the paradox where RLVR-tuned LLMs underperform on Pass@K despite promising reasoning advances.

Method: Introduce CoT-Pass@K metric to evaluate reasoning paths and final answers, and provide theoretical support for RLVR's logical integrity.

Result: RLVR shows improved reasoning generalization with CoT-Pass@K, and training dynamics reveal early and smooth capability enhancement.

Conclusion: RLVR's potential is validated with proper evaluation, offering reliable advancement in machine reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned models often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for solution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights existing reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we resolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the $Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct final answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of thought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric, $CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final answer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how RLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical integrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we observe that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for all values of $K$. Furthermore, by analyzing the training dynamics, we find that this enhanced reasoning capability emerges early in the training process and smoothly generalizes. Our work provides a clear perspective on the role of RLVR, offers a more reliable method for its evaluation, and confirms its potential to genuinely advance machine reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help people learn from AI agents by making their decision-making processes in Mahjong (a complex game with imperfect information) more understandable.

Method: Mxplainer, a parameterized search algorithm converted into a neural network, learns parameters from black-box AI and human player data.

Result: The learned parameters offer human-understandable insights into AI agents' play styles, and the framework explains their decisions for most game states.

Conclusion: Mxplainer successfully bridges the gap between black-box AI and human understanding, enabling better learning from AI agents in Mahjong.

Abstract: People need to internalize the skills of AI agents to improve their own capabilities. Our paper focuses on Mahjong, a multiplayer game involving imperfect information and requiring effective long-term decision-making amidst randomness and hidden information. Through the efforts of AI researchers, several impressive Mahjong AI agents have already achieved performance levels comparable to those of professional human players; however, these agents are often treated as black boxes from which few insights can be gleaned. This paper introduces Mxplainer, a parameterized search algorithm that can be converted into an equivalent neural network to learn the parameters of black-box agents. Experiments conducted on AI and human player data demonstrate that the learned parameters provide human-understandable insights into these agents' characteristics and play styles. In addition to analyzing the learned parameters, we also showcase how our search-based framework can locally explain the decision-making processes of black-box agents for most Mahjong game states.

*Jack Cole,Mohamed Osman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that deep learning, combined with on-the-fly NN training and novel test-time techniques, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ARC-AGI challenge, boosting accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ARC-AGI challenge is difficult for AI systems, and deep learning, despite its limitations, remains the most effective strategy for training skillful neural networks. The work aims to leverage deep learning's capacity for abstraction to improve performance on ARC.

Method: The methodology involves training on ARC using pretrained LLMs, introducing Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as test-time techniques. Both the neural network and optimizer are treated as part of the inference process.

Result: The approach achieved a 260% accuracy boost with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT, securing first place in the 2023 ARCathon and the best score (58%) on the ARC private test-set.

Conclusion: Deep learning, when fully leveraged for novel abstractions and combined with effective test-time techniques, can significantly improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks like ARC, highlighting key mechanisms for robust reasoning in unfamiliar domains.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems. Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%). Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ADRD, a framework using LLMs to create interpretable, rule-based autonomous driving systems, outperforming traditional methods in interpretability, speed, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for interpretable autonomous driving decision-making systems by leveraging LLMs' reasoning and programming capabilities.

Method: ADRD integrates three modules: Information (aggregates driving scenarios), Agents (generates rule-based tactics), and Testing (iteratively refines tactics).

Result: ADRD outperforms reinforcement learning and advanced LLM-based methods in interpretability, response speed, and driving performance.

Conclusion: The study validates the potential of combining LLMs with rule-based systems for autonomous driving, offering a transparent and modifiable solution.

Abstract: How to construct an interpretable autonomous driving decision-making system has become a focal point in academic research. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate executable, rule-based decision systems to address this challenge. Specifically, harnessing the strong reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs, we introduce the ADRD(LLM-Driven Autonomous Driving Based on Rule-based Decision Systems) framework, which integrates three core modules: the Information Module, the Agents Module, and the Testing Module. The framework operates by first aggregating contextual driving scenario information through the Information Module, then utilizing the Agents Module to generate rule-based driving tactics. These tactics are iteratively refined through continuous interaction with the Testing Module. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADRD exhibits superior performance in autonomous driving decision tasks. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches and the most advanced LLM-based methods, ADRD shows significant advantages in terms of interpretability, response speed, and driving performance. These results highlight the framework's ability to achieve comprehensive and accurate understanding of complex driving scenarios, and underscore the promising future of transparent, rule-based decision systems that are easily modifiable and broadly applicable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates large language models with rule-based systems for autonomous driving decision-making, and our findings validate its potential for real-world deployment.

*Jia'ang Wan,Feng Shen,Fujuan Li,Yanjin Sun,Yan Li,Shiwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RALA-DPO, a method combining Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance aviation training by improving LLM accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aviation training relies on limited instructors and unreliable online answers, leading to inefficiency. Basic LLMs lack accuracy in professional fields, and traditional fine-tuning risks incorrect responses.

Method: Proposes RALA-DPO: fine-tuning Qwen LLM with DPO for domain alignment and integrating RAG to retrieve external knowledge, reducing hallucinations.

Result: RALA-DPO improves accuracy in aviation knowledge responses and enables zero-cost knowledge updates.

Conclusion: RALA-DPO effectively addresses training inefficiencies by combining DPO and RAG, enhancing LLM performance in aviation theory.

Abstract: Aviation training is a core link in ensuring flight safety, improving industry efficiency and promoting sustainable development. It not only involves flight simulation but also requires the learning of a great deal of professional aviation theory knowledge. In the existing training system, the knowledge is mainly imparted by the the instructors. However, the number of instructors is limited and the professional answers obtained from the Internet are not accurate enough, resulting in low training efficiency. To address this, we introduced LLM, but the basic pre-trained model cannot provide accurate answers to professional fields, so we fine-tuned it. Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) risk generating superficially plausible but factually incorrect responses due to insufficient data coverage. To address this, we employ Direct Preference Optimization(DPO). This paper proposes Retrieval-Augmented LLM Alignment via Direct Preference Optimization(RALA-DPO). We select open source pre-trained LLM Qwen and adapt it to aviation theory training through DPO-based domain alignment. Simultaneously, to mitigate hallucinations caused by training data biases, knowledge obsolescence, or domain knowledge gaps, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) technology that combines generative and retrieval models. RALA-DPO effectively retrieves relevant information from external knowledge bases and delivers precise and high-quality responses through the generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that RALA-DPO can improve accuracy in response to professional aviation knowledge. With integrated RAG mechanisms, this system can further improve the accuracy of answers and achieve zero-cost knowledge updates simultaneously.

*William F. Shen,Xinchi Qiu,Nicola Cancedda,Nicholas D. Lane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAT is a fine-tuning method for LLMs that preserves ignorance awareness and performance by using sparse training and entity perturbation with KL-divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods degrade safety alignment capabilities, like expressing ignorance, leading to hallucinations.

Method: SEAT combines sparse training to limit activation drift and entity perturbation with KL-divergence regularization to prevent knowledge entanglement.

Result: SEAT outperforms baselines in maintaining ignorance awareness and fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: SEAT provides a robust solution for LLM fine-tuning by preserving essential safety capabilities.

Abstract: Existing work on mitigating catastrophic forgetting in large language model (LLM) fine-tuning has primarily focused on preserving specific data or tasks, while critically overlooking the degradation of essential capabilities instilled through safety alignment, particularly the model's ability to faithfully express ignorance. In this work, we show that this capability is significantly degraded during conventional fine-tuning, leading to undesired behaviors such as hallucinations. To address this novel but highly practical problem, we propose SEAT, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that preserves both fine-tuning performance and the model's inherent ability to acknowledge its ignorance. SEAT integrates two key components: (1) sparse training that constrains activation drift, and (2) a novel entity perturbation method with KL-divergence regularization, designed to counter knowledge entanglement. Experimental results demonstrate that SEAT significantly outperforms baselines in preserving ignorance awareness while retaining fine-tuning performance, offering a more robust solution for LLM fine-tuning.

### [36] [AST-Enhanced or AST-Overloaded? The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14470)
*Zixian Zhang,Takfarinas Saber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates hybrid AST-based representations (AST+CFG+DFG, FA-AST) in GNN-based code clone detection, finding AST+CFG+DFG improves accuracy for some GNNs, while FA-AST often harms performance. GMN excels even with standard AST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code clones increase maintenance costs and risks, but ASTs lack semantic depth. Enriched AST-based representations (e.g., CFG, DFG) are promising but their effectiveness and compatibility with GNNs are unclear.

Method: A comprehensive empirical study comparing hybrid AST-based representations (AST+CFG+DFG, FA-AST) across multiple GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GMN).

Result: AST+CFG+DFG improves accuracy for GCN and GAT, but FA-AST often reduces performance. GMN performs best even with standard AST.

Conclusion: Hybrid representations impact GNNs differently; GMN's superior performance suggests enriched structures may not always be necessary for effective code clone detection.

Abstract: As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance. Notably, GMN outperforms others even with standard AST representations, highlighting its superior cross-code similarity detection and reducing the need for enriched structures.

Motivation: Existing GUI datasets are idealized, lacking real-world anomalies, which limits their practical benchmarking value.

Method: A semi-automated paradigm using RPA tools and MLLMs to collect and annotate user action sequences, reducing annotation time by 19x.

Result: State-of-the-art GUI agents show significant performance degradation in abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: GUI-Robust emphasizes the need for robustness in GUI agents and encourages future research in this area.

Abstract: The development of high-quality datasets is crucial for benchmarking and advancing research in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Despite their importance, existing datasets are often constructed under idealized conditions, overlooking the diverse anomalies frequently encountered in real-world deployments. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI-Robust, a novel dataset designed for comprehensive GUI agent evaluation, explicitly incorporating seven common types of anomalies observed in everyday GUI interactions. Furthermore, we propose a semi-automated dataset construction paradigm that collects user action sequences from natural interactions via RPA tools and then generate corresponding step and task descriptions for these actions with the assistance of MLLMs. This paradigm significantly reduces annotation time cost by a factor of over 19 times. Finally, we assess state-of-the-art GUI agents using the GUI-Robust dataset, revealing their substantial performance degradation in abnormal scenarios. We anticipate that our work will highlight the importance of robustness in GUI agents and inspires more future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares traditional swarm intelligence (e.g., Boids, ACO) with LLM-driven swarms, assessing decentralization, scalability, and emergence in AI. It evaluates performance and resource trade-offs, highlighting LLMs' potential and challenges in swarm systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how modern AI (LLMs) redefines traditional swarm intelligence concepts like decentralization and emergence, and to assess the feasibility of integrating LLMs into swarm systems.

Method: Implemented and compared traditional swarm algorithms (Boids, ACO) with LLM-driven swarms, evaluating latency, resource usage, and behavioral accuracy. Also assessed cloud-based vs. local LLMs for swarm applications.

Result: LLMs offer advanced reasoning but introduce computational and coordination challenges. Traditional swarms excel in efficiency, while LLM swarms provide abstraction at a cost.

Conclusion: LLMs expand swarm capabilities but face constraints. The study underscores the evolving definition of 'swarm' in AI and the need to balance trade-offs in hybrid systems.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence traditionally refers to systems of simple, decentralized agents whose local interactions lead to emergent, collective behavior. Recently, the term 'swarm' has been extended to describe AI systems like OpenAI's Swarm, where large language models (LLMs) act as collaborative agents. This paper contrasts traditional swarm algorithms with LLM-driven swarms exploring how decentralization, scalability, and emergence are redefined in modern artificial intelligence (AI). We implement and compare both paradigms using Boids and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), evaluating latency, resource usage, and behavioral accuracy. The suitability of both cloud-based and local LLMs is assessed for the agent-based use in swarms. Although LLMs offer powerful reasoning and abstraction capabilities, they introduce new constraints in computation and coordination that challenge traditional notions of swarm design. This study highlights the opportunities and limitations of integrating LLMs into swarm systems and discusses the evolving definition of 'swarm' in modern AI research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A safety-first human-like decision-making framework (SF-HLDM) is proposed for AVs to navigate dense, interactive traffic by combining intention inference, behavior regulation, and efficient search methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle in dynamic, dense traffic due to human unpredictability and data-driven methods' limitations, necessitating a robust, adaptable decision-making framework.

Method: SF-HLDM integrates spatial-temporal attention for intention inference, social compliance estimation, and Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning to avoid local optima and overfitting.

Result: The framework enables AVs to dynamically adjust decisions for safety and social compatibility while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: SF-HLDM improves AV decision-making in complex traffic by balancing safety, comfort, and social compatibility.

Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have shown great potential in improving transport efficiency and safety, autonomous vehicles(AVs) still face great challenge of driving in time-varying traffic flow, especially in dense and interactive situations. Meanwhile, human have free wills and usually do not make the same decisions even situate in the exactly same scenarios, leading to the data-driven methods suffer from poor migratability and high search cost problems, decreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the behavior policy. In this research, we propose a safety-first human-like decision-making framework(SF-HLDM) for AVs to drive safely, comfortably, and social compatiblely in effiency. The framework integrates a hierarchical progressive framework, which combines a spatial-temporal attention (S-TA) mechanism for other road users' intention inference, a social compliance estimation module for behavior regulation, and a Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning(DERL) model for expanding the search space efficiently and effectively to make avoidance of falling into the local optimal trap and reduce the risk of overfitting, thus make human-like decisions with interpretability and flexibility. The SF-HLDM framework enables autonomous driving AI agents dynamically adjusts decision parameters to maintain safety margins and adhering to contextually appropriate driving behaviors at the same time.

*Daewon Kang,YeongHwan Shin,Doyeon Kim,Kyu-Hwan Jung,Meong Hi Son*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Doppelgänger method' to highlight risks of prompt hijacking in autonomous agents, proposes 'PACAT' to measure vulnerability, and suggests 'CAT' prompts for defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and robustness concerns in prompt-based autonomous agents due to potential hijacking and information exposure.

Method: Proposes the 'Doppelgänger method' for hijacking prompts, defines 'PACAT' to evaluate vulnerability, and introduces 'CAT' prompts for defense.

Result: Doppelgänger method successfully compromises agent consistency and exposes internal info; CAT prompts effectively defend against it.

Conclusion: The study underscores prompt hijacking risks and validates CAT prompts as a viable defense mechanism.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use. Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelgänger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelgänger method. The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelgänger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUEST is a quality-aware semi-supervised framework for table extraction from business documents, improving accuracy and reducing errors by leveraging structural and contextual quality assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating table extraction from business documents is challenging due to sparse annotations and unreliable confidence scores in existing methods.

Method: QUEST introduces a quality assessment model predicting F1 scores, guiding pseudo-label selection in SSL training, and uses diversity measures to avoid confirmation bias.

Result: On proprietary and benchmark datasets, QUEST improved F1 scores (64% to 74% and 42% to 50%) and reduced empty predictions (45% and 19%).

Conclusion: QUEST's interpretable quality assessments and robustness to annotation scarcity make it effective for business documents, ensuring structural consistency and data completeness.

Abstract: Automating table extraction (TE) from business documents is critical for industrial workflows but remains challenging due to sparse annotations and error-prone multi-stage pipelines. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage unlabeled data, existing methods rely on confidence scores that poorly reflect extraction quality. We propose QUEST, a Quality-aware Semi-supervised Table extraction framework designed for business documents. QUEST introduces a novel quality assessment model that evaluates structural and contextual features of extracted tables, trained to predict F1 scores instead of relying on confidence metrics. This quality-aware approach guides pseudo-label selection during iterative SSL training, while diversity measures (DPP, Vendi score, IntDiv) mitigate confirmation bias. Experiments on a proprietary business dataset (1000 annotated + 10000 unannotated documents) show QUEST improves F1 from 64% to 74% and reduces empty predictions by 45% (from 12% to 6.5%). On the DocILE benchmark (600 annotated + 20000 unannotated documents), QUEST achieves a 50% F1 score (up from 42%) and reduces empty predictions by 19% (from 27% to 22%). The framework's interpretable quality assessments and robustness to annotation scarcity make it particularly suited for business documents, where structural consistency and data completeness are paramount.

*Stephen Roth,Lennart Baur,Derian Boer,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing symbolic machine learning (e.g., TILDE) with neural embeddings to improve efficiency and performance, outperforming baselines in F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies of neuro-symbolic AI systems (e.g., LTNs, DeepProbLog) in simpler settings like discriminative ML, especially with many constants.

Method: Enhances symbolic ML (TILDE) by integrating neural embeddings for constants in similarity predicates, with fine-tuning based on symbolic theory.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in F1 scores across three real-world domains.

Conclusion: The approach is simple yet effective, with potential extensions to instance similarities, analogical reasoning, and propositionalization.

Abstract: The goal of neuro-symbolic AI is to integrate symbolic and subsymbolic AI approaches, to overcome the limitations of either. Prominent systems include Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) or DeepProbLog, which offer neural predicates and end-to-end learning. The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score. The approach could be useful beyond this setting: Enhancing symbolic learners in this way could be extended to similarities between instances (effectively working like kernels within a logical language), for analogical reasoning, or for propositionalization.

Motivation: Current foundation models lack the ability to handle the spatial, temporal, and semantic complexity of mobility data, limiting scalable and transferable analysis.

Method: Proposes a shift from discrete points of interest to dynamic, context-rich places, integrating geolocation semantics with mobility across scales.

Result: Identifies gaps in adaptability, scalability, and multi-granular reasoning, suggesting research directions for efficient learning.

Conclusion: Aims to develop scalable, context-aware models for next-gen geospatial intelligence, enabling smarter spatial decision-making in applications like urban planning and logistics.

Abstract: Capturing human mobility is essential for modeling how people interact with and move through physical spaces, reflecting social behavior, access to resources, and dynamic spatial patterns. To support scalable and transferable analysis across diverse geographies and contexts, there is a need for a generalizable foundation model for spatiotemporal data. While foundation models have transformed language and vision, they remain limited in handling the unique challenges posed by the spatial, temporal, and semantic complexity of mobility data. This vision paper advocates for a new class of spatial foundation models that integrate geolocation semantics with human mobility across multiple scales. Central to our vision is a shift from modeling discrete points of interest to understanding places: dynamic, context-rich regions shaped by human behavior and mobility that may comprise many places of interest. We identify key gaps in adaptability, scalability, and multi-granular reasoning, and propose research directions focused on modeling places and enabling efficient learning. Our goal is to guide the development of scalable, context-aware models for next-generation geospatial intelligence. These models unlock powerful applications ranging from personalized place discovery and logistics optimization to urban planning, ultimately enabling smarter and more responsive spatial decision-making.

TL;DR: AgentDistill is a training-free framework for distilling LLM-based agents by reusing structured task-solving modules (MCPs) from teachers, enabling efficient generalization to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent distillation methods struggle with dynamic planning in novel environments, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: AgentDistill reuses Model-Context-Protocols (MCPs), structured task-solving modules autonomously generated by teacher agents, for training-free knowledge transfer.

Result: Distilled student agents achieve performance comparable to advanced systems (e.g., GPT-4o) on biomedical and mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: AgentDistill offers a scalable and cost-efficient solution for building intelligent agents without extensive training.

Abstract: While knowledge distillation has become a mature field for compressing large language models (LLMs) into smaller ones by aligning their outputs or internal representations, the distillation of LLM-based agents, which involve planning, memory, and tool use, remains relatively underexplored. Existing agent distillation methods typically replay full teacher trajectories or imitate step-by-step teacher tool usage, but they often struggle to train student agents to dynamically plan and act in novel environments. We propose AgentDistill, a novel, training-free agent distillation framework that enables efficient and scalable knowledge transfer via direct reuse of Model-Context-Protocols (MCPs), which are structured and reusable task-solving modules autonomously generated by teacher agents. The reuse of these distilled MCPs enables student agents to generalize their capabilities across domains and solve new problems with minimal supervision or human intervention. Experiments on biomedical and mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our distilled student agents, built on small language models, can achieve performance comparable to advanced systems using large LLMs such as OctoTools (GPT-4o), highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in building scalable and cost-efficient intelligent agents.

TL;DR: LC-R1, a post-training method, reduces reasoning chain length by ~50% with minimal accuracy drop (~2%) by eliminating redundancy and preserving critical steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of 'invalid thinking' in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), where models redundantly double-check correct answers.

Method: Introduces LC-R1 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Length and Compress Rewards to eliminate redundancy and invalid reasoning.

Result: Achieves ~50% reduction in sequence length with only ~2% accuracy drop, optimizing for brevity and sufficiency.

Conclusion: LC-R1 offers a robust solution for efficient LRMs, balancing high compression and accuracy, with insights for future model development.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet they often suffer from producing unnecessary and verbose reasoning chains. We identify a core aspect of this issue as "invalid thinking" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression. Our analysis further validates the robustness of LC-R1 and provides valuable insights for developing more powerful yet computationally efficient LRMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zxiangx/LC-R1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LittleBit is a novel method for extreme LLM compression, achieving 31× memory reduction at 0.1 bits per weight (BPW) through low-rank factorization and multi-scale compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of memory and computational costs in deploying large language models (LLMs) by improving sub-1-bit quantization performance.

Method: Uses latent matrix factorization to represent weights in low-rank form, binarizes factors, and integrates multi-scale compensation (row, column, latent dimension). Introduces Dual-SVID for stable QAT initialization and Residual Compensation for error mitigation.

Result: Achieves 0.1 BPW compression (e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB), outperforming leading methods (0.7 BPW) and enabling a 5× speedup over FP16.

Conclusion: LittleBit establishes a superior size-performance trade-off, enabling efficient deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) often faces challenges from substantial memory and computational costs. Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for stable quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. This establishes a superior size-performance trade-off, with kernel-level benchmarks indicating potential for a 5$\times$ speedup compared to FP16. LittleBit paves the way for deploying powerful LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Zhenyan Lu,Daliang Xu,Dongqi Cai,Zexi Li,Wei Liu,Fangming Liu,Shangguang Wang,Mengwei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MobiEdit is a mobile knowledge editing framework for LLMs that replaces backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, enabling efficient personalization on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate on personalized or unseen queries, and existing knowledge editing methods are impractical for mobile due to resource-heavy backpropagation.

Method: MobiEdit uses quantized forward-only gradient estimation, an early stopping mechanism, and a prefix cache to optimize efficiency.

Result: MobiEdit achieves 7.6× less memory, 14.7× less energy, and 3.6× less latency compared to prior methods on a 3B-parameter model.

Conclusion: MobiEdit enables real-time LLM personalization on mobile devices, addressing the limitations of prior knowledge editing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed on mobile devices to power killer applications such as intelligent assistants. LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps. Our approach enables real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) on COTS mobile devices with 7.6$\times$ less memory, 14.7 $\times$ less energy and 3.6$\times$ less latency compared to previous knowledge editing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JobShopLib is introduced as a modular library for customizing job shop scheduling with GNNs, simplifying experimentation and achieving near state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional job shop scheduling uses simple heuristics, but deep learning models like GNNs offer potential improvements. However, the lack of modular tools makes research time-consuming.

Method: JobShopLib provides a customizable reinforcement learning environment for training GNN-based dispatchers, demonstrated via imitation learning.

Result: A GNN model outperformed graph-based dispatchers using minimal features, achieving near state-of-the-art performance on large-scale problems.

Conclusion: JobShopLib enables efficient experimentation, highlighting the potential for further improvements in GNN-based scheduling models.

Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem relevant to manufacturing and timetabling. Traditional approaches use priority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has attempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training such models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node features, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for experimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces JobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and creating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained several dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's utility. One model outperformed various graph-based dispatchers using only individual operation features, highlighting the importance of feature customization. Our GNN model achieved near state-of-the-art results on large-scale problems. These results suggest significant room for improvement in developing such models. JobShopLib provides the necessary tools for future experimentation.

Conclusion: EBMBag+ is effective for diabetes prevalence prediction, offering a robust tool for healthcare planning.

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, leading to complications like heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Accurate state-level predictions are vital for effective healthcare planning and targeted interventions, but in many cases, data for necessary analyses are incomplete. This study begins with a data engineering process to integrate diabetes-related datasets from 2011 to 2021 to create a comprehensive feature set. We then introduce an enhanced bagging ensemble regression model (EBMBag+) for time series forecasting to predict diabetes prevalence across U.S. cities. Several baseline models, including SVMReg, BDTree, LSBoost, NN, LSTM, and ERMBag, were evaluated for comparison with our EBMBag+ algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that EBMBag+ achieved the best performance, with an MAE of 0.41, RMSE of 0.53, MAPE of 4.01, and an R2 of 0.9.

TL;DR: A hybrid meta-learning framework combining physics-inspired simulation, CNN-LSTM, VAE, Isolation Forests, and DA-RNN for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear, nonstationary, and stochastic dynamical systems where complete physical models are unavailable.

Method: Integrates physics-inspired simulation with CNN-LSTM for feature extraction, VAE for anomaly scoring, Isolation Forests for outlier detection, and DA-RNN for forecasting, combined via a meta-learner.

Result: Outperforms standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations.

Conclusion: Offers a versatile, data-driven solution for early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by nonstationary and stochastic behavior. The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.

*Jitian Zhao,Chenghui Li,Frederic Sala,Karl Rohe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hypothesis testing framework for statistically rigorous concept identification in CLIP embeddings, improving interpretability and reducing spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-based methods lack statistical rigor, making validation and comparison difficult.

Method: Introduces a hypothesis testing framework to identify rotation-sensitive structures in CLIP embeddings, followed by a post-hoc concept decomposition method with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Outperforms other techniques in reconstruction error and increases worst-group accuracy by 22.6% after removing spurious concepts.

Conclusion: The method balances accuracy and interpretability, mitigating spurious cues in data.

Abstract: Concept-based approaches, which aim to identify human-understandable concepts within a model's internal representations, are a promising method for interpreting embeddings from deep neural network models, such as CLIP. While these approaches help explain model behavior, current methods lack statistical rigor, making it challenging to validate identified concepts and compare different techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a hypothesis testing framework that quantifies rotation-sensitive structures within the CLIP embedding space. Once such structures are identified, we propose a post-hoc concept decomposition method. Unlike existing approaches, it offers theoretical guarantees that discovered concepts represent robust, reproducible patterns (rather than method-specific artifacts) and outperforms other techniques in terms of reconstruction error. Empirically, we demonstrate that our concept-based decomposition algorithm effectively balances reconstruction accuracy with concept interpretability and helps mitigate spurious cues in data. Applied to a popular spurious correlation dataset, our method yields a 22.6% increase in worst-group accuracy after removing spurious background concepts.

TL;DR: An evolvable conditional diffusion method is introduced for guiding generative processes using black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics models, validated in fluidic topology and meta-surface design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous scientific discovery by leveraging non-differentiable multi-physics models (e.g., in computational fluid dynamics, electromagnetics) for generative guidance.

Method: Formulates guidance as an optimization problem, using probabilistic evolution to derive an update algorithm analogous to gradient-based methods but without derivatives.

Result: Validated in AI for Science scenarios, the method generates designs meeting optimization objectives without requiring differentiable proxies.

Conclusion: The approach provides effective guidance-based diffusion for black-box models, expanding their utility in scientific applications.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolvable conditional diffusion method such that black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics models, as are common in domains like computational fluid dynamics and electromagnetics, can be effectively used for guiding the generative process to facilitate autonomous scientific discovery. We formulate the guidance as an optimization problem where one optimizes for a desired fitness function through updates to the descriptive statistic for the denoising distribution, and derive an evolution-guided approach from first principles through the lens of probabilistic evolution. Interestingly, the final derived update algorithm is analogous to the update as per common gradient-based guided diffusion models, but without ever having to compute any derivatives. We validate our proposed evolvable diffusion algorithm in two AI for Science scenarios: the automated design of fluidic topology and meta-surface. Results demonstrate that this method effectively generates designs that better satisfy specific optimization objectives without reliance on differentiable proxies, providing an effective means of guidance-based diffusion that can capitalize on the wealth of black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics numerical models common across Science.

TL;DR: T-REX is a SUMO-based framework for evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic traffic incidents, revealing performance gaps in robustness and advocating for hierarchical coordination in irregular networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored robustness of RL-TSC methods under real-world disruptions like traffic incidents.

Method: Developed T-REX, a simulation framework modeling realistic traffic behaviors (rerouting, speed adaptation, lane-changing) and proposed robustness metrics. Evaluated state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods in synthetic and real-world networks.

Result: Independent methods perform well in stable conditions but degrade under incidents. Hierarchical methods offer stability in irregular networks but with slower convergence.

Conclusion: Robustness-aware design is crucial for RL-TSC. T-REX provides a standardized platform for benchmarking under dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.

*Lorena Poenaru-Olaru,June Sallou,Luis Cruz,Jan Rellermeyer,Arie van Deursen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores energy-efficient retraining techniques for ML systems, showing that using recent data or updating only when necessary can reduce energy consumption by 25% and 40%, respectively, without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational and environmental costs of traditional ML model retraining by identifying more sustainable alternatives.

Method: Study the energy consumption of common retraining techniques, comparing them in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Retraining with recent data reduces energy by 25%, while updating only when necessary reduces it by 40%. Both methods maintain accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable recommendations for designing sustainable ML systems with energy-efficient retraining techniques.

Abstract: The reliability of machine learning (ML) software systems is heavily influenced by changes in data over time. For that reason, ML systems require regular maintenance, typically based on model retraining. However, retraining requires significant computational demand, which makes it energy-intensive and raises concerns about its environmental impact. To understand which retraining techniques should be considered when designing sustainable ML applications, in this work, we study the energy consumption of common retraining techniques. Since the accuracy of ML systems is also essential, we compare retraining techniques in terms of both energy efficiency and accuracy. We showcase that retraining with only the most recent data, compared to all available data, reduces energy consumption by up to 25\%, being a sustainable alternative to the status quo. Furthermore, our findings show that retraining a model only when there is evidence that updates are necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can reduce energy consumption by up to 40\%, provided a reliable data change detector is in place. Our findings pave the way for better recommendations for ML practitioners, guiding them toward more energy-efficient retraining techniques when designing sustainable ML software systems.

TL;DR: SatHealth is a novel dataset combining multimodal spatiotemporal data to improve AI models in healthcare by incorporating environmental data, satellite images, and SDoH indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack long-term, fine-grained environmental data, limiting AI model performance in healthcare.

Method: Developed SatHealth dataset and tested it in regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction.

Result: Environmental data significantly improved AI model performance and spatiotemporal generalizability.

Conclusion: SatHealth provides a foundational framework for integrating environmental data in healthcare research, with plans to expand coverage and accessibility.

Abstract: Living environments play a vital role in the prevalence and progression of diseases, and understanding their impact on patient's health status becomes increasingly crucial for developing AI models. However, due to the lack of long-term and fine-grained spatial and temporal data in public and population health studies, most existing studies fail to incorporate environmental data, limiting the models' performance and real-world application. To address this shortage, we developed SatHealth, a novel dataset combining multimodal spatiotemporal data, including environmental data, satellite images, all-disease prevalences estimated from medical claims, and social determinants of health (SDoH) indicators. We conducted experiments under two use cases with SatHealth: regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction. Experimental results show that living environmental information can significantly improve AI models' performance and temporal-spatial generalizability on various tasks. Finally, we deploy a web-based application to provide an exploration tool for SatHealth and one-click access to both our data and regional environmental embedding to facilitate plug-and-play utilization. SatHealth is now published with data in Ohio, and we will keep updating SatHealth to cover the other parts of the US. With the web application and published code pipeline, our work provides valuable angles and resources to include environmental data in healthcare research and establishes a foundational framework for future research in environmental health informatics.

*Alena Shilova,Alex Davey,Brahim Driss,Riad Akrour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PMD-like algorithms (StaQ) that retain only the last M Q-functions, ensuring convergence and stability in deep RL, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regularization in RL improves exploration and stability, but existing PMD frameworks are impractical due to intractable memory requirements.

Method: Develops PMD-like algorithms (StaQ) by limiting stored Q-functions to the last M, ensuring tractability and correctness.

Result: StaQ achieves convergence, reduces performance oscillation, and competes with deep RL baselines.

Conclusion: StaQ offers a stable, practical PMD implementation, advancing deep RL and enabling further PMD experimentation.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), regularization has emerged as a popular tool both in theory and practice, typically based either on an entropy bonus or a Kullback-Leibler divergence that constrains successive policies. In practice, these approaches have been shown to improve exploration, robustness and stability, giving rise to popular Deep RL algorithms such as SAC and TRPO. Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a theoretical framework that solves this general regularized policy optimization problem, however the closed-form solution involves the sum of all past Q-functions, which is intractable in practice. We propose and analyze PMD-like algorithms that only keep the last $M$ Q-functions in memory, and show that for finite and large enough $M$, a convergent algorithm can be derived, introducing no error in the policy update, unlike prior deep RL PMD implementations. StaQ, the resulting algorithm, enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and is competitive with deep RL baselines, while exhibiting less performance oscillation, paving the way for fully stable deep RL algorithms and providing a testbed for experimentation with Policy Mirror Descent.

TL;DR: Algorithm Distillation (AD) is improved using S6 models (Mamba) for In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL), outperforming transformers in complex environments and scaling linearly with sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in AD face limitations due to quadratic complexity, restricting use to simple environments. S6 models offer linear scaling and better performance for long sequences.

Method: Replace transformers with S6-based Mamba models in AD, tested on four complex Meta RL environments.

Result: Mamba outperforms transformers in AD, scales to long contexts, and matches SOTA online meta RL performance.

Conclusion: S6 models like Mamba enhance AD for ICRL, enabling scalability and superior performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Algorithm Distillation (AD) was recently proposed as a new approach to perform In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) by modeling across-episodic training histories autoregressively with a causal transformer model. However, due to practical limitations induced by the attention mechanism, experiments were bottlenecked by the transformer's quadratic complexity and limited to simple discrete environments with short time horizons. In this work, we propose leveraging the recently proposed Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, which achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-range sequence modeling while scaling linearly in sequence length. Through four complex and continuous Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, we demonstrate the overall superiority of Mamba, a model built with S6 layers, over a transformer model for AD. Additionally, we show that scaling AD to very long contexts can improve ICRL performance and make it competitive even with a SOTA online meta RL baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding feature contributions and interactions in complex rule-based systems, especially in critical domains like healthcare.

Method: Proposes a framework with graph-based visualization, a feature importance metric, and a rule set distance metric. Evaluated on clinical datasets using four rule-based methods.

Result: Uncovered insights on clinical feature predictive value, identified risk factors and biomarkers, and showed competitive performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances interpretability and utility of rule-based systems in healthcare, aiding in better decision-making and diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: In domains where transparency and trustworthiness are crucial, such as healthcare, rule-based systems are widely used and often preferred over black-box models for decision support systems due to their inherent interpretability. However, as rule-based models grow complex, discerning crucial features, understanding their interactions, and comparing feature contributions across different rule sets becomes challenging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for estimating feature contributions in rule-based systems, introducing a graph-based feature visualisation strategy, a novel feature importance metric agnostic to rule-based predictors, and a distance metric for comparing rule sets based on feature contributions. By experimenting on two clinical datasets and four rule-based methods (decision trees, logic learning machines, association rules, and neural networks with rule extraction), we showcase our method's capability to uncover novel insights on the combined predictive value of clinical features, both at the dataset and class-specific levels. These insights can aid in identifying new risk factors, signature genes, and potential biomarkers, and determining the subset of patient information that should be prioritised to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Comparative analysis of the proposed feature importance score with state-of-the-art methods on 15 public benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance and superior robustness. The method implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ChristelSirocchi/rule-graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning complex PDE systems on irregular geometries and non-uniform meshes efficiently.

Method: GITO uses a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) for local and long-range spatial relationships and a transformer neural operator (TNO) for discretization-invariant predictions.

Result: GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators on benchmark PDE tasks.

Conclusion: GITO enables efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers for engineering applications.

Abstract: We present a novel graph-informed transformer operator (GITO) architecture for learning complex partial differential equation systems defined on irregular geometries and non-uniform meshes. GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.

*Xinyuan Tu,Haocheng Zhang,Tao Chengxu,Zuyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores few-shot learning (FSL) for industrial time-series data, focusing on screw-fastening defect detection. It introduces a label-aware episodic sampler and benchmarks FSL methods, showing lightweight CNNs with metric learning outperform large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSL is promising for industrial time-series data due to high annotation costs, but its application remains underexplored. The study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A label-aware episodic sampler is introduced to handle multi-label sequences. Two FSL paradigms (Prototypical Network and MAML) are tested with three backbones (1D CNN, InceptionTime, transformer Moment) on a 2,300-sample dataset.

Result: InceptionTime + Prototypical Network achieves 0.944 weighted F1 (multi-class) and 0.935 (multi-label), outperforming larger models. Metric learning consistently beats MAML, and label-aware sampling adds 1.7% F1.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNNs with metric learning outperform large models in data-scarce scenarios, challenging the superiority of foundation models. Code and data are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in vision but remains largely unexplored for \emph{industrial} time-series data, where annotating every new defect is prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic FSL study on screw-fastening process monitoring, using a 2\,300-sample multivariate torque dataset that covers 16 uni- and multi-factorial defect types. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a \textbf{label-aware episodic sampler} that collapses multi-label sequences into multiple single-label tasks, keeping the output dimensionality fixed while preserving combinatorial label information.
  Two FSL paradigms are investigated: the metric-based \emph{Prototypical Network} and the gradient-based \emph{Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning} (MAML), each paired with three backbones: 1D CNN, InceptionTime and the 341 M-parameter transformer \emph{Moment}. On 10-shot, 3-way evaluation, the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieves a \textbf{0.944 weighted F1} in the multi-class regime and \textbf{0.935} in the multi-label regime, outperforming finetuned Moment by up to 5.3\% while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training time. Across all backbones, metric learning consistently surpasses MAML, and our label-aware sampling yields an additional 1.7\% F1 over traditional class-based sampling.
  These findings challenge the assumption that large foundation models are always superior: when data are scarce, lightweight CNN architectures augmented with simple metric learning not only converge faster but also generalize better. We release code, data splits and pre-trained weights to foster reproducible research and to catalyze the adoption of FSL in high-value manufacturing inspection.

Motivation: To enhance the expressiveness of GNNs by incorporating hierarchical node individualization, inspired by graph isomorphism testing methods.

Method: Proposes HEGNNs, a hierarchy of models with increasing expressiveness, characterized using graded hybrid logic. Compares with higher-order GNNs and color refinement algorithms.

Result: HEGNNs can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism and show practical benefits over traditional GNNs, even without local homomorphism count features.

Conclusion: HEGNNs offer a promising extension to GNNs, improving expressiveness and practical performance in graph-related tasks.

Abstract: We propose and study Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), an expressive extension of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical node individualization, inspired by the Individualization-Refinement paradigm for graph isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We provide a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers, with and without subgraph restrictions, using graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.

Our approach, referred to as Branched Stein Variational Gradient Descent (BSVGD), extends the classical Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by incorporating a random branching mechanism that encourages the exploration of the state space. In this work, a theoretical guarantee for the convergence in distribution is presented, as well as numerical experiments to validate the suitability of our algorithm. Performance comparisons between the BSVGD and the SVGD are presented using the Wasserstein distance between samples and the corresponding computational times.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR training improves reasoning models by compressing pass@k into pass@1 and enabling capability gain, with self-distillation as a key driver. The study introduces Guide, an adaptive training algorithm, showing significant improvements in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning models trained with RLVR learn to solve new problems and improve performance through mechanisms like capability gain and self-distillation.

Method: Analyzes RLVR training across model scales (0.5B to 72B) on >500,000 problems, introduces Guide for adaptive hint incorporation and policy optimization.

Result: Guide improves pass@k rates and generalization, with up to 4% macro-average improvement on math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Guide, a novel training algorithm, enhances reasoning model performance by adaptively incorporating hints and optimizing policies, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.

Abstract: We study the process through which reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new problems. We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via "capability gain" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the "off-policy" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks. We include careful ablations to analyze $\text{Guide}$'s components and theoretically analyze Guide's learning efficiency.

*Vishesh Kumar Tanwar,Soumik Sarkar,Asheesh K. Singh,Sajal K. Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReinDSplit is a reinforcement learning-driven framework that dynamically optimizes DNN split points for edge devices in agriculture, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional split learning frameworks struggle with device heterogeneity in agriculture, causing inefficiencies and performance issues.

Method: Uses Q-learning to dynamically tailor DNN split points, balancing workloads and latency thresholds.

Result: Achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2 on insect classification datasets.

Conclusion: ReinDSplit enhances split learning by integrating RL for better resource efficiency, privacy, and scalability in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: To empower precision agriculture through distributed machine learning (DML), split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and servers to reduce computational burdens and preserve data privacy. However, conventional SL frameworks' one-split-fits-all strategy is a critical limitation in agricultural ecosystems where edge insect monitoring devices exhibit vast heterogeneity in computational power, energy constraints, and connectivity. This leads to straggler bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and compromised model performance. Bridging this gap, we introduce ReinDSplit, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework that dynamically tailors DNN split points for each device, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a Q-learning agent acts as an adaptive orchestrator, balancing workloads and latency thresholds across devices to mitigate computational starvation or overload. By framing split layer selection as a finite-state Markov decision process, ReinDSplit convergence ensures that highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training over time. Evaluated on three insect classification datasets using ResNet18, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2, ReinDSplit achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2. Beyond agriculture, ReinDSplit pioneers a paradigm shift in SL by harmonizing RL for resource efficiency, privacy, and scalability in heterogeneous environments.

*Leonardo Guiducci,Antonio Rizzo,Giovanna Maria Dimitri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDTs with intrinsic motivation improve performance, and a new explainability framework reveals how intrinsic motivation shapes embeddings, showing environment-specific benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intrinsic motivation mechanisms in EDTs shape learned embeddings and improve performance in offline reinforcement learning.

Method: A post-hoc explainability framework analyzing embedding properties (covariance, vector magnitudes, orthogonality) to reveal representational structures.

Result: Different intrinsic motivation variants create distinct representational structures, with environment-specific correlations between embedding metrics and performance.

Conclusion: Intrinsic motivation acts as a representational prior, shaping embeddings in biologically plausible ways to enhance decision-making.

Abstract: Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.

*Zhiqi Wang,Chengyu Zhang,Yuetian Chen,Nathalie Baracaldo,Swanand Kadhe,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights disparities in membership inference attacks (MIAs) and proposes an ensemble framework to improve privacy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior MIA research focuses on performance metrics but overlooks disparities between attacks, affecting reliability and completeness of privacy evaluation.

Method: A novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis is used to investigate MIA disparities. An ensemble framework with three strategies is proposed to leverage state-of-the-art MIAs.

Result: Experiments reveal significant MIA disparities, their causes, and implications for privacy evaluation. The ensemble framework enhances attack power and evaluation robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses MIA disparities, offering a more reliable and comprehensive approach to privacy evaluation.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to the privacy of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment, auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.

*Michael Crawshaw,Blake Woodworth,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing analysis of Local (Stochastic) Gradient Descent for heterogeneous objectives requires stepsizes $η\leq 1/K$ where $K$ is the communication interval, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective. In contrast, we analyze Local Gradient Descent for logistic regression with separable, heterogeneous data using any stepsize $η> 0$. With $R$ communication rounds and $M$ clients, we show convergence at a rate $\mathcal{O}(1/ηK R)$ after an initial unstable phase lasting for $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(ηK M)$ rounds. This improves upon the existing $\mathcal{O}(1/R)$ rate for general smooth, convex objectives. Our analysis parallels the single machine analysis of~\cite{wu2024large} in which instability is caused by extremely large stepsizes, but in our setting another source of instability is large local updates with heterogeneous objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QCL-MixNet, a quantum-informed contrastive learning framework with dynamic mixup, outperforms existing methods in handling class-imbalanced tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of conventional methods (e.g., overfitting, poor generalization) in detecting rare but critical instances in expert systems.

Method: Integrates quantum-inspired feature modeling, dynamic mixup for minority classes, and a hybrid loss function for robust classification.

Result: Outperforms 20 state-of-the-art baselines on 18 datasets in macro-F1 and recall.

Conclusion: QCL-MixNet sets a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Expert systems often operate in domains characterized by class-imbalanced tabular data, where detecting rare but critical instances is essential for safety and reliability. While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.

TL;DR: AssistedDS benchmark evaluates LLMs' ability to use domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks, revealing gaps in critical evaluation and application of expert insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can critically leverage external domain knowledge like human data scientists in automated data science workflows.

Method: Introduces AssistedDS, a benchmark with synthetic and real-world datasets, including helpful and adversarial documents, to evaluate LLMs' performance in handling domain knowledge.

Result: LLMs often uncritically adopt information, struggle with adversarial content, and make errors in time-series and categorical data handling.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robust critical evaluation of domain knowledge, highlighting a need for more knowledge-aware automated systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

TL;DR: ALST enables long sequence training for HF models, supporting up to 15M tokens on a 4-node H100 cluster, a 400x improvement over the 32K baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long sequence training is challenging due to memory constraints and lack of open-source solutions, limiting accessibility for the AI community.

Method: ALST combines attention-agnostic single-GPU and multi-GPU memory optimizations to support multi-million sequence lengths for HF models.

Result: ALST achieves 500K tokens on a single H100 GPU, 3.7M on an 8xH100 node, and 15M on a 4-node cluster.

Conclusion: ALST democratizes long sequence training by making it accessible and scalable for HF models, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Long sequences are critical for applications like RAG, long document summarization, multi-modality, etc., and modern LLMs, like Llama 4 Scout, support max sequence length of up to 10 million tokens. However, outside of enterprise labs, long sequence training is challenging for the AI community with limited system support in the open-source space.
  Out-of-box, even on a modern NVIDIA H100 80GB GPU cluster, training Llama 8B model with sequence over 32K runs out of memory on a basic Hugging Face (HF) model due to two reasons: i) LLM training workloads are not optimized to fully leverage a single GPU memory, ii) existing solutions for leveraging multiple GPU memory are not easily available to HF models, making long sequence training inaccessible.
  We address this with Arctic Long Sequence Training (ALST). It offers a combination of attention-agnostic single GPU and multi-GPU memory optimizations, that enables it to support out-of-box training of multi-million sequence length for a wide variety of HF models.
  ALST supports training Meta's Llama 8B model with 500K sequence length on a single H100 GPU, 3.7M on a single 8xH100 GPU node, and over 15M on a 4 node cluster, an increase of over 400x compared to the 32K baseline for the latter.

*Siyu Chen,Heejune Sheen,Xuyuan Xiong,Tianhao Wang,Zhuoran Yang*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel statistical framework and training algorithm for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to improve feature recovery in Large Language Models (LLMs), with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE training algorithms lack rigorous guarantees and face practical issues like hyperparameter sensitivity. The goal is to enhance interpretability and trust in AI systems.

Method: Proposes a statistical framework for feature identifiability and a new SAE training algorithm using bias adaptation. Also introduces Group Bias Adaptation (GBA) for empirical improvements.

Result: Theoretically proves feature recovery under the proposed model and shows GBA outperforms benchmarks on LLMs up to 1.5B parameters.

Conclusion: This work advances SAE training with theoretical guarantees, improving mechanistic interpretability for more transparent AI systems.

Abstract: We study the challenge of achieving theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for the interpretation of Large Language Models. Existing SAE training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees and suffer from practical limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and instability. To address these issues, we first propose a novel statistical framework for the feature recovery problem, which includes a new notion of feature identifiability by modeling polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of underlying monosemantic concepts. Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically \highlight{prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features} when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model. Furthermore, we develop an improved empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), and \highlight{demonstrate its superior performance against benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters}. This work represents a foundational step in demystifying SAE training by providing the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, thereby advancing the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI systems through enhanced mechanistic interpretability.

*Yiwei Chen,Soumyadeep Pal,Yimeng Zhang,Qing Qu,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in machine unlearning for LLMs, showing that unlearning leaves detectable traces in model behavior and internal representations, which can be exploited to reverse-engineer forgotten information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the risks of unlearning trace detection in LLMs, which can compromise data privacy, copyright enforcement, and harm mitigation efforts.

Method: The study uses supervised classifiers to detect unlearning traces in LLM outputs and analyzes intermediate activations to identify low-dimensional manifolds.

Result: Experiments show over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces, even with forget-irrelevant inputs, revealing persistent signatures.

Conclusion: Unlearning leaves measurable traces, posing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten data, necessitating further research to mitigate this vulnerability.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

*Keyue Jiang,Jiahao Cui,Xiaowen Dong,Laura Toni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BWFlow is a flow-matching framework for graph generation that leverages optimal transport and Markov random fields to respect graph geometry, outperforming traditional Euclidean-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods assume Euclidean space, which is suboptimal for graphs' non-Euclidean structure, risking sampling convergence.

Method: BWFlow models joint node-edge evolution using Markov random fields and optimal transport to design a probability path, adapting to continuous/discrete flow-matching.

Result: BWFlow achieves competitive performance in plain graph and molecule generation, with stable training and guaranteed convergence.

Conclusion: BWFlow provides a superior approach to graph generation by respecting intrinsic geometry, improving performance and convergence.

Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from molecule design to drug discovery. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference distribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space. We show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling convergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design the probability path for graph generation. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and provides smooth velocities in the probability path. The novel framework can be adapted to both continuous and discrete flow-matching algorithms. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and 2D/3D molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow in graph generation with competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IE-PINN is a novel neural network for robustly estimating heterogeneous elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for inverse elasticity problems are unstable, noise-sensitive, and struggle with absolute-scale Young's modulus recovery.

Method: IE-PINN uses three neural networks for displacement, strain, and elasticity fields, a two-phase estimation strategy, and innovations like positional encoding and sine activations.

Result: IE-PINN achieves accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: IE-PINN advances elasticity parameter estimation, with potential applications in noisy clinical imaging and mechanical diagnostics.

Abstract: Accurately estimating spatially heterogeneous elasticity parameters, particularly Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, from noisy displacement measurements remains significantly challenging in inverse elasticity problems. Existing inverse estimation techniques are often limited by instability, pronounced sensitivity to measurement noise, and difficulty in recovering absolute-scale Young's modulus. This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly reconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three distinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby significantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise. Additionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase recovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using imposed loading boundary conditions. Additional methodological innovations, including positional encoding, sine activation functions, and a sequential pretraining protocol, further enhance the model's performance and robustness. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that IE-PINN effectively overcomes critical limitations encountered by existing methods, delivering accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise conditions. This advancement holds substantial potential for clinical imaging diagnostics and mechanical characterization, where measurements typically encounter substantial noise.

TL;DR: A novel load balancing loss for Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models improves convergence and reduces redundancy by preserving token-wise relational structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current load balancing mechanisms in MoE models lead to inconsistent routing and redundant knowledge, limiting model capacity and performance.

Method: Introduces a new load balancing loss that encourages consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training.

Result: The proposed loss achieves 36% faster convergence and lower redundancy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The novel loss enhances MoE model efficiency by improving routing consistency and reducing redundant learning.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models offer a scalable and efficient architecture for training large neural networks by activating only a subset of parameters ("experts") for each input. A learned router computes a distribution over these experts, and assigns input tokens to a small subset. However, without auxiliary balancing mechanisms, routers often converge to using only a few experts, severely limiting model capacity and degrading performance. Most current load balancing mechanisms encourage a distribution over experts that resembles a roughly uniform distribution of experts per token. During training, this can result in inconsistent routing behavior, resulting in the model spending its capacity to learn redundant knowledge. We address this by introducing a novel load balancing loss that preserves token-wise relational structure, encouraging consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training. Our experimental results show that applying our loss to the router results in 36% faster convergence and lower redundancy compared to a popular load balancing loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScIReN combines neural networks with process-based models for interpretable scientific discovery, outperforming black-box models in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks lack interpretability and adherence to scientific laws, while process-based models often fit poorly due to ad-hoc parameters. ScIReN aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ScIReN uses an interpretable encoder to predict latent parameters, processed by a differentiable decoder, with a hard-sigmoid layer for parameter constraints.

Result: ScIReN outperforms black-box models in tasks like carbon flow and ecosystem respiration modeling, revealing hidden scientific mechanisms.

Conclusion: ScIReN offers a transparent, accurate, and interpretable framework for scientific discovery, combining neural and process-based reasoning.

Abstract: Neural networks are a powerful tool for learning patterns from data. However, they do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific insights due to their black-box nature. In contrast, scientific reasoning distills biological or physical principles from observations and controlled experiments, and quantitatively interprets them with process-based models made of mathematical equations. Yet, process-based models rely on numerous free parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and thus often fit observations poorly in cross-scale predictions. While prior work has embedded process-based models in conventional neural networks, discovering interpretable relationships between parameters in process-based models and input features is still a grand challenge for scientific discovery. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge, further enhancing its interpretability. While the embedded process-based model enforces established scientific knowledge, the encoder reveals new scientific mechanisms and relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online learning algorithm for selective generation in large language models to control hallucination under partial feedback, leveraging bandit problems for theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the hallucination effect in large language models by enabling selective generation under non-stochastic environments and partial user feedback.

Method: Reduce selective generation to multi-armed bandit problems, introduce a conversion lemma, and exploit arm structure for feedback unlocking to improve convergence.

Result: The algorithm controls false discovery rate (FDR) while maintaining selection efficiency, outperforming baselines in diverse setups.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively manages hallucination in selective generation under partial feedback, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Large language generative models increasingly interact with humans, while their falsified responses raise concerns. To address this hallucination effect, selectively abstaining from answering, called selective generation, provides an effective way for generators to control the hallucination when it is unsure of their answers. However, as selective generators are interacting under non-stochastic environments and having partial feedback from users on selective generation (e.g., thumbs up or down on the selected answer), learning methods for selective generation under such practical setups are crucial but currently missing. To address these limitations, we propose an online learning algorithm for selective generation under partial feedback. In particular, as learning under partial feedback is well-studied by multi-armed bandit problems, we reduce selective generation to bandits and provide a novel conversion lemma from bandits back to selective generation to leverage any known bandit algorithms and theoretical properties. This mainly connects regret guarantees of bandits to false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees of selective generation for controlling hallucination. However, naively exploiting known bandit algorithms and their regret bounds suffers from slow convergence speed in practice due the nature of partial feedback. To overcome this, we exploit a unique structure of arms in selective generation for feedback unlocking, i.e., unlocking unknown feedback from observed feedback. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed online selective generation algorithm under partial feedback over diverse data environment setups, resulting in controlling a desired FDR, while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency, i.e., the ratio of non-abstaining answers, compared to baselines.

*Zhongzheng Qiao,Chenghao Liu,Yiming Zhang,Ming Jin,Quang Pham,Qingsong Wen,P. N. Suganthan,Xudong Jiang,Savitha Ramasamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSFT, a multi-scale finetuning framework for time series foundation models (TSFMs), addressing overfitting and suboptimal performance in naive finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive finetuning of TSFMs fails to fully utilize their multi-scale forecasting capabilities, leading to overfitting and poor performance.

Method: The paper introduces MSFT, a framework that explicitly models multiple scales during finetuning, tested on encoder-based TSFMs.

Result: MSFT outperforms naive finetuning, parameter-efficient methods, and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches across three TSFM backbones.

Conclusion: Explicit multi-scale modeling in finetuning (MSFT) significantly enhances TSFM performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance for time series forecasting. However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on \textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{\textsc{s}}cale \textbf{\textsc{f}}ine\textbf{\textsc{t}}uning (\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (\moirai, \moment\ and \units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

*Parikshit Ram,Kenneth L. Clarkson,Tim Klinger,Shashanka Ubaru,Alexander G. Gray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse transformers with input-dependent attention converge faster and generalize better than standard or input-agnostic sparse attention, due to improved semantic focus. Theoretical analysis links softmax stability and Lipschitz properties to these benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparse attention affects learnability and generalization in transformers, beyond just computational efficiency.

Method: Empirical study of various attention mechanisms, comparing input-dependent and input-agnostic sparse attention, supported by theoretical analysis of softmax stability and Lipschitz properties.

Result: Input-dependent sparse attention outperforms standard and input-agnostic sparse attention in convergence and generalization. Theoretical analysis confirms these benefits under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Input-dependent sparse attention enhances learning by focusing semantically, while input-agnostic sparse attention offers no advantages. Theoretical insights align with empirical findings.

Abstract: Various forms of sparse attention have been explored to mitigate the quadratic computational and memory cost of the attention mechanism in transformers. We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but rather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a range of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a phenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter choices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's "semantic focus" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the form of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a theoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We establish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the loss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the stability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization guarantees resulting from the attention mechanism. This allows us to theoretically establish that input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide any benefits. We also characterize conditions when semantic focus (input-dependent sparse attention) can provide improved guarantees, and we validate that these conditions are in fact met in our empirical evaluations.

*Ziyuan Tang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph foundation model using Transformer architecture, addressing challenges in encoding diverse graphs by representing nodes as random walks, and demonstrates its potential for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of building a foundation model for graphs, similar to those in natural language, given the success of models like GPT.

Method: Adapts the Transformer backbone for graphs by representing nodes as multiple random walks, using a novel context prediction loss, and theoretically analyzing their expressive power.

Result: The model successfully pre-trains and adapts to downstream tasks, showing promise as a foundation for graph-structured data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach lays groundwork for graph foundation models, demonstrating adaptability and potential for broader applications in graph processing.

Abstract: A foundation model like GPT elicits many emergent abilities, owing to the pre-training with broad inclusion of data and the use of the powerful Transformer architecture. While foundation models in natural languages are prevalent, can we build similar models for graphs? This paper describes an approach toward a graph foundation model that is pre-trained with diverse graph datasets by adapting the Transformer backbone. A central challenge toward this end is how a sequence model encodes graphs of varying sizes and from different domains. We propose representing a node as multiple random walks, such that the Transformer can extract node representations from sequences, which in turn form edge and graph representations. We develop a novel context prediction loss for these random walks and theoretically analyze their expressive power in distinguishing neighborhoods and graphs. We also demonstrate the pre-training of our model and its adaptation to downstream tasks, showcasing its potential as a foundation for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data.

*Yitian Zhang,Liheng Ma,Antonios Valkanas,Boris N. Oreshkin,Mark Coates*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects Koopman operator theory with linear RNNs, proposing SKOLR for efficient nonlinear dynamical system forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between infinite-dimensional Koopman operators and practical finite-dimensional approximations using linear RNNs.

Method: Introduces SKOLR, combining learnable spectral decomposition with MLPs for measurement functions and structured Koopman operators via parallel linear RNNs.

Result: Demonstrates exceptional performance on forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems.

Conclusion: SKOLR offers a streamlined, theory-based design for effective nonlinear system analysis and forecasting.

Abstract: Koopman operator theory provides a framework for nonlinear dynamical system analysis and time-series forecasting by mapping dynamics to a space of real-valued measurement functions, enabling a linear operator representation. Despite the advantage of linearity, the operator is generally infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the objective is to learn measurement functions that yield a tractable finite-dimensional Koopman operator approximation. In this work, we establish a connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have recently demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling. We show that by considering an extended state consisting of lagged observations, we can establish an equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. Building on this connection, we present SKOLR, which integrates a learnable spectral decomposition of the input signal with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the measurement functions and implements a structured Koopman operator via a highly parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on various forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems show that this streamlined, Koopman-theory-based design delivers exceptional performance.

*Khushnood Abbas,Ruizhe Hou,Zhou Wengang,Dong Shi,Niu Ling,Satyaki Nan,Alireza Abbasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large-scale study evaluates GNN architectures and loss functions, finding hybrid losses and GIN architecture perform best, while MPNN lags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GNN models and loss functions interact across tasks, as prior work studied them separately.

Method: Evaluated seven GNN architectures and 30 loss functions on three datasets, using 21 metrics in inductive and transductive settings.

Result: Hybrid losses outperform single ones; GIN with Cross-Entropy excels, while MPNN underperforms.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization (hybrid losses) and GIN architecture are recommended for robust GNN performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) became useful for learning on non-Euclidean data. However, their best performance depends on choosing the right model architecture and the training objective, also called the loss function. Researchers have studied these parts separately, but a large-scale evaluation has not looked at how GNN models and many loss functions work together across different tasks. To fix this, we ran a thorough study - it included seven well-known GNN architectures. We also used a large group of 30 single plus mixed loss functions. The study looked at both inductive and transductive settings. Our evaluation spanned three distinct real-world datasets, assessing performance in both inductive and transductive settings using 21 comprehensive evaluation metrics. From these extensive results (detailed in supplementary information 1 \& 2), we meticulously analyzed the top ten model-loss combinations for each metric based on their average rank. Our findings reveal that, especially for the inductive case: 1) Hybrid loss functions generally yield superior and more robust performance compared to single loss functions, indicating the benefit of multi-objective optimization. 2) The GIN architecture always showed the highest-level average performance, especially with Cross-Entropy loss. 3) Although some combinations had overall lower average ranks, models such as GAT, particularly with certain hybrid losses, demonstrated incredible specialized strengths, maximizing the most top-1 results among the individual metrics, emphasizing subtle strengths for particular task demands. 4) On the other hand, the MPNN architecture typically lagged behind the scenarios it was tested against.

*Tianming Zhang,Renbo Zhang,Zhengyi Yang,Yunjun Gao,Bin Cao,Jing Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLGNN, a contrastive learning-based GNN for accurate and efficient Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) prediction, addressing class imbalance and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact TBC computation is costly, and existing methods fail to handle class imbalance or temporal dependencies, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: CLGNN uses dual aggregation (mean and edge-to-node attention) with temporal encodings and introduces KContrastNet for class separation and ValueNet for regression.

Result: CLGNN achieves significant speedups (663.7x) and outperforms baselines with lower MAE and higher Spearman correlation.

Conclusion: CLGNN effectively addresses TBC prediction challenges, offering scalability and accuracy.

Abstract: Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) measures how often a node appears on optimal temporal paths, reflecting its importance in temporal networks. However, exact computation is highly expensive, and real-world TBC distributions are extremely imbalanced. The severe imbalance leads learning-based models to overfit to zero-centrality nodes, resulting in inaccurate TBC predictions and failure to identify truly central nodes. Existing graph neural network (GNN) methods either fail to handle such imbalance or ignore temporal dependencies altogether. To address these issues, we propose a scalable and inductive contrastive learning-based GNN (CLGNN) for accurate and efficient TBC prediction. CLGNN builds an instance graph to preserve path validity and temporal order, then encodes structural and temporal features using dual aggregation, i.e., mean and edge-to-node multi-head attention mechanisms, enhanced by temporal path count and time encodings. A stability-based clustering-guided contrastive module (KContrastNet) is introduced to separate high-, median-, and low-centrality nodes in representation space, mitigating class imbalance, while a regression module (ValueNet) estimates TBC values. CLGNN also supports multiple optimal path definitions to accommodate diverse temporal semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CLGNN across diverse benchmarks. CLGNN achieves up to a 663.7~$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art exact TBC computation methods. It outperforms leading static GNN baselines with up to 31.4~$\times$ lower MAE and 16.7~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation, and surpasses state-of-the-art temporal GNNs with up to 5.7~$\times$ lower MAE and 3.9~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation.

### [86] [Less is More: Undertraining Experts Improves Model Upcycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14126)
*Stefan Horoi,Guy Wolf,Eugene Belilovsky,Gintare Karolina Dziugaite*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that improvements in fine-tuning propagate downstream in model upcycling, showing that long fine-tuning harms merging performance and suggests early stopping as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how expert fine-tuning impacts model upcycling, questioning the assumption that gains at one pipeline stage benefit downstream steps.

Method: Examined the effects of long fine-tuning on merging performance for fully fine-tuned and LoRA-adapted models, and upcycled LoRA adapters into MoE layers.

Result: Long fine-tuning degrades merging performance due to memorization of difficult examples, which are forgotten during merging. Early stopping improves upcycling.

Conclusion: Aggressive early stopping, tailored to the task, can significantly enhance upcycling performance by mitigating the negative effects of prolonged fine-tuning.

Abstract: Modern deep learning is increasingly characterized by the use of open-weight foundation models that can be fine-tuned on specialized datasets. This has led to a proliferation of expert models and adapters, often shared via platforms like HuggingFace and AdapterHub. To leverage these resources, numerous model upcycling methods have emerged, enabling the reuse of fine-tuned models in multi-task systems. A natural pipeline has thus formed to harness the benefits of transfer learning and amortize sunk training costs: models are pre-trained on general data, fine-tuned on specific tasks, and then upcycled into more general-purpose systems. A prevailing assumption is that improvements at one stage of this pipeline propagate downstream, leading to gains at subsequent steps. In this work, we challenge that assumption by examining how expert fine-tuning affects model upcycling. We show that long fine-tuning of experts that optimizes for their individual performance leads to degraded merging performance, both for fully fine-tuned and LoRA-adapted models, and to worse downstream results when LoRA adapters are upcycled into MoE layers. We trace this degradation to the memorization of a small set of difficult examples that dominate late fine-tuning steps and are subsequently forgotten during merging. Finally, we demonstrate that a task-dependent aggressive early stopping strategy can significantly improve upcycling performance.

### [87] [Leveraging Predictive Equivalence in Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14143)
*Hayden McTavish,Zachery Boner,Jon Donnelly,Margo Seltzer,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses predictive equivalence in decision trees, introduces a boolean logical representation to avoid it, and demonstrates its benefits in robustness to missing values, variable importance, and prediction cost optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision trees suffer from predictive equivalence, where different trees can represent the same decision boundary, complicating model selection and interpretation.

Method: The authors propose a boolean logical representation of decision trees to eliminate predictive equivalence and apply it to tasks like handling missing values and variable importance.

Result: The new representation shows decision trees are robust to missing feature values, clarifies variable importance, and enables cost-effective prediction optimization.

Conclusion: The boolean logical representation resolves predictive equivalence, improving decision tree interpretability and utility in practical applications.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used for interpretable machine learning due to their clearly structured reasoning process. However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.

*Amirhossein Rajabpour,Kiarash Aghakasiri,Sandra Zilles,Levi H. S. Lelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural policies can generalize as well as programmatic policies on OOD problems with simple training adjustments, challenging the common belief that programmatic policies inherently generalize better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the undervaluation of neural policies' generalization capabilities in OOD problems and improve benchmarking practices.

Method: Analyzed experiments from four papers, modified neural policies with simpler architectures, sparse observations, and safer reward functions.

Result: Neural policies achieved comparable OOD generalization to programmatic policies with these adjustments.

Conclusion: Benchmarks should better highlight generalization challenges, and neural policies can match programmatic ones with proper training modifications.

Abstract: Algorithms for learning programmatic representations for sequential decision-making problems are often evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, with the common conclusion that programmatic policies generalize better than neural policies on OOD problems. In this position paper, we argue that commonly used benchmarks undervalue the generalization capabilities of programmatic representations. We analyze the experiments of four papers from the literature and show that neural policies, which were shown not to generalize, can generalize as effectively as programmatic policies on OOD problems. This is achieved with simple changes in the neural policies training pipeline. Namely, we show that simpler neural architectures with the same type of sparse observation used with programmatic policies can help attain OOD generalization. Another modification we have shown to be effective is the use of reward functions that allow for safer policies (e.g., agents that drive slowly can generalize better). Also, we argue for creating benchmark problems highlighting concepts needed for OOD generalization that may challenge neural policies but align with programmatic representations, such as tasks requiring algorithmic constructs like stacks.

Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of on-policy (HAPPO) and off-policy (HASAC) MARL methods in a cooperative-competitive combat setting.

Method: Evaluated HAPPO (hierarchical PPO) and HASAC (hierarchical SAC) in the LAG environment, analyzing training stability, rewards, and coordination.

Result: HASAC performs better in simpler tasks (No Weapon), while HAPPO excels in dynamic scenarios (ShootMissile).

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between on-policy and off-policy methods in MARL, with HAPPO showing stronger adaptability in complex settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in a partially observable, cooperative-competitive combat environment known as LAG. We describe the environment's setup, including agent actions, hierarchical controls, and reward design across different combat modes such as No Weapon and ShootMissile. Two representative algorithms are evaluated: HAPPO, an on-policy hierarchical variant of PPO, and HASAC, an off-policy method based on soft actor-critic. We analyze their training stability, reward progression, and inter-agent coordination capabilities. Experimental results show that HASAC performs well in simpler coordination tasks without weapons, while HAPPO demonstrates stronger adaptability in more dynamic and expressive scenarios involving missile combat. These findings provide insights into the trade-offs between on-policy and off-policy methods in multi-agent settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical representation theorems with modern probabilistic modeling, improving interpretability, efficiency, and sample quality in generative models.

Method: Uses a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network generator with independent energy-based priors, trained via Maximum Likelihood, and incorporates scalable extensions like mixture distributions and Langevin Monte Carlo.

Result: Achieves fast inference, better prior-posterior alignment, and recoverable, visualizable priors, balancing flexibility and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Connects classical and modern methods, offering a stable, efficient, and high-quality generative model.

Abstract: We adapt the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to generative modeling by reinterpreting its inner functions as a Markov Kernel between probability spaces via inverse transform sampling. We present a generative model that is interpretable, easy to design, and efficient. Our approach couples a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network generator with independent energy-based priors, trained via Maximum Likelihood. Inverse sampling enables fast inference, while prior knowledge can be incorporated before training to better align priors with posteriors, thereby improving learning efficiency and sample quality. The learned prior is also recoverable and visualizable post-training, offering an empirical Bayes perspective. To address inflexibility and mitigate prior-posterior mismatch, we introduce scalable extensions based on mixture distributions and Langevin Monte Carlo methods, admitting a trade-off between flexibility and training efficiency. Our contributions connect classical representation theorems with modern probabilistic modeling, while balancing training stability, inference speed, and the quality and diversity of generations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general framework for creating explainable OOD detection features in neural networks.

Method: Introduces a novel loss functional with KL divergence and Information Bottleneck terms, optimized via variational procedure to derive OOD features.

Result: The theory predicts a new shaping function that outperforms existing ones on OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a versatile framework for generating explainable OOD features, advancing the field.

Abstract: We present a theory for the construction of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection features for neural networks. We introduce random features for OOD through a novel information-theoretic loss functional consisting of two terms, the first based on the KL divergence separates resulting in-distribution (ID) and OOD feature distributions and the second term is the Information Bottleneck, which favors compressed features that retain the OOD information. We formulate a variational procedure to optimize the loss and obtain OOD features. Based on assumptions on OOD distributions, one can recover properties of existing OOD features, i.e., shaping functions. Furthermore, we show that our theory can predict a new shaping function that out-performs existing ones on OOD benchmarks. Our theory provides a general framework for constructing a variety of new features with clear explainability.

Result: Achieves significant memory reduction proportional to block count while maintaining competitive performance in generative tasks.

Conclusion: DiffusionBlocks democratizes access to large-scale neural network training with limited resources.

Abstract: Training large neural networks with end-to-end backpropagation creates significant memory bottlenecks, limiting accessibility to state-of-the-art AI research. We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a novel training framework that interprets neural network blocks as performing denoising operations in a continuous-time diffusion process. By partitioning the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise level assignments based on equal cumulative probability mass, our approach achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional backpropagation in generative tasks. Experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks demonstrate memory reduction proportional to the number of blocks while achieving superior performance. DiffusionBlocks provides a promising pathway for democratizing access to large-scale neural network training with limited computational resources.

Motivation: Ensuring neural network reliability under adversarial and distributional shifts is a critical challenge.

Result: TriGuard identifies mismatches between accuracy and interpretability, revealing subtle fragilities in neural reasoning. Entropy-regularized training reduces explanation drift without performance loss.

Conclusion: TriGuard advances robust, interpretable model evaluation by uncovering critical safety insights beyond traditional metrics.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often achieve high accuracy, but ensuring their reliability under adversarial and distributional shifts remains a pressing challenge. We propose TriGuard, a unified safety evaluation framework that combines (1) formal robustness verification, (2) attribution entropy to quantify saliency concentration, and (3) a novel Attribution Drift Score measuring explanation stability. TriGuard reveals critical mismatches between model accuracy and interpretability: verified models can still exhibit unstable reasoning, and attribution-based signals provide complementary safety insights beyond adversarial accuracy. Extensive experiments across three datasets and five architectures show how TriGuard uncovers subtle fragilities in neural reasoning. We further demonstrate that entropy-regularized training reduces explanation drift without sacrificing performance. TriGuard advances the frontier in robust, interpretable model evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to estimate graph homophily and guide spectral filter design in Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), improving performance under label-scarce conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGNNs struggle with suboptimal filters in label-scarce scenarios, while LLMs show potential in GNNs. The paper explores if LLMs can enhance SGNNs.

Method: A lightweight pipeline where LLMs generate homophily-aware priors to adaptively design polynomial spectral filters for SGNNs.

Result: The LLM-driven SGNN framework outperforms baselines in homophilic and heterophilic settings with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively enhance SGNNs by providing homophily-aware guidance, improving adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to approximate arbitrary filters. They typically rely on supervision from downstream tasks to adaptively learn appropriate filters. However, under label-scarce conditions, SGNNs may learn suboptimal filters, leading to degraded performance. Meanwhile, the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential within the GNN domain. This naturally raises an important question: \textit{Can LLMs help overcome the limitations of SGNNs and enhance their performance?} In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs to estimate the homophily of a given graph. The estimated homophily is then used to adaptively guide the design of polynomial spectral filters, thereby improving the expressiveness and adaptability of SGNNs across diverse graph structures. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight pipeline in which the LLM generates homophily-aware priors, which are injected into the filter coefficients to better align with the underlying graph topology. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LLM-driven SGNN framework consistently outperforms existing baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic settings, with minimal computational and monetary overhead.

TL;DR: DP-Ditto extends Ditto for PFL with differential privacy, balancing privacy, convergence, and fairness, outperforming other PFL models in accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in PFL (like Ditto) where local model perturbations impact convergence and fairness, proposing a DP-protected solution.

Method: Introduces DP-Ditto, a differentially private version of Ditto, analyzing trade-offs between privacy, convergence, and fairness, and optimizing global aggregations.

Result: DP-Ditto outperforms state-of-the-art PFL models (FedAMP, pFedMe, etc.) by 32.71% in fairness and 9.66% in accuracy.

Conclusion: DP-Ditto effectively balances privacy, convergence, and fairness, proving superior to existing PFL models under DP constraints.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL), e.g., the renowned Ditto, strikes a balance between personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to guide personalized learning (PL). While FL is unaffected by personalized model training, in Ditto, PL depends on the outcome of the FL. However, the clients' concern about their privacy and consequent perturbation of their local models can affect the convergence and (performance) fairness of PL. This paper presents PFL, called DP-Ditto, which is a non-trivial extension of Ditto under the protection of differential privacy (DP), and analyzes the trade-off among its privacy guarantee, model convergence, and performance distribution fairness. We also analyze the convergence upper bound of the personalized models under DP-Ditto and derive the optimal number of global aggregations given a privacy budget. Further, we analyze the performance fairness of the personalized models, and reveal the feasibility of optimizing DP-Ditto jointly for convergence and fairness. Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that DP-Ditto can surpass the DP-perturbed versions of the state-of-the-art PFL models, such as FedAMP, pFedMe, APPLE, and FedALA, by over 32.71% in fairness and 9.66% in accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can evade latent-space monitors via RL-Obfuscation, with token-level monitors being vulnerable, while holistic ones remain robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs can learn to bypass latent-space monitors designed to detect undesirable behaviors.

Method: Introduce RL-Obfuscation, finetuning LLMs via reinforcement learning to evade monitors while maintaining coherent outputs.

Result: Token-level monitors are highly vulnerable; holistic monitors (max-pooling, attention-based) remain robust. Adversarial policies generalize to unseen monitors.

Conclusion: LLMs can evade certain monitors, highlighting the need for more robust monitoring techniques.

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. Finally, we study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different internally.

*Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how machines can adapt quickly by correcting approximate posteriors, drawing parallels to human and animal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models lack the adaptivity of toddlers, and the mechanisms for natural machine adaptation are poorly understood.

Method: The study uses a dual-perspective of the Bayesian Learning Rule to characterize interference during adaptation as natural-gradient mismatch.

Result: More accurate posteriors lead to smaller corrections, enabling quicker adaptation, demonstrated through various examples.

Conclusion: Posterior-correction serves as a natural mechanism for machines to learn to adapt quickly, bridging the gap between AI and human-like adaptability.

Abstract: Adaptation is the holy grail of intelligence, but even the best AI models (like GPT) lack the adaptivity of toddlers. So the question remains: how can machines adapt quickly? Despite a lot of progress on model adaptation to facilitate continual and federated learning, as well as model merging, editing, unlearning, etc., little is known about the mechanisms by which machines can naturally learn to adapt in a similar way as humans and animals. Here, we show that all such adaptation methods can be seen as different ways of `correcting' the approximate posteriors. More accurate posteriors lead to smaller corrections, which in turn imply quicker adaptation. The result is obtained by using a dual-perspective of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023) where interference created during adaptation is characterized by the natural-gradient mismatch over the past data. We present many examples to demonstrate the use of posterior-correction as a natural mechanism for the machines to learn to adapt quickly.

### [98] [Towards Robust Learning to Optimize with Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14263)
*Qingyu Song,Wei Lin,Juncheng Wang,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of theoretical proof for Learning to Optimize (L2O) models' performance and robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, providing conditions and proofs for robustness and proposing a new L2O model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing L2O works lack theoretical guarantees for performance and robustness in OOD scenarios, which this paper aims to address.

Method: The paper proves a sufficient condition for robust L2O models, aligns OOD problems to InD problems, and introduces a gradient-only feature construction and gradient-based history modeling method.

Result: The proposed L2O model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both InD and OOD scenarios, achieving up to 10x convergence speedup.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical foundations for L2O robustness and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging technique to solve mathematical optimization problems with learning-based methods. Although with great success in many real-world scenarios such as wireless communications, computer networks, and electronic design, existing L2O works lack theoretical demonstration of their performance and robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We address this gap by providing comprehensive proofs. First, we prove a sufficient condition for a robust L2O model with homogeneous convergence rates over all In-Distribution (InD) instances. We assume an L2O model achieves robustness for an InD scenario. Based on our proposed methodology of aligning OOD problems to InD problems, we also demonstrate that the L2O model's convergence rate in OOD scenarios will deteriorate by an equation of the L2O model's input features. Moreover, we propose an L2O model with a concise gradient-only feature construction and a novel gradient-based history modeling method. Numerical simulation demonstrates that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in both InD and OOD scenarios and achieves up to 10 $\times$ convergence speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IVON, a variational algorithm, improves LoRA finetuning by enhancing metrics like accuracy and calibration while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian methods for LoRA finetuning improve calibration but often harm other metrics and increase computational costs. IVON addresses these issues.

Method: Uses IVON, a variational algorithm, with posterior pruning for efficient and effective LoRA finetuning.

Result: IVON outperforms AdamW and Bayesian methods, improving accuracy by 1.3% and reducing ECE by 5.4% on Llama-3.2-3B.

Conclusion: IVON is a practical and effective alternative for LoRA finetuning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Bayesian methods have recently been used to improve LoRA finetuning and, although they improve calibration, their effect on other metrics (such as accuracy) is marginal and can sometimes even be detrimental. Moreover, Bayesian methods also increase computational overheads and require additional tricks for them to work well. Here, we fix these issues by using a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON. We show that IVON is easy to implement and has similar costs to AdamW, and yet it can also drastically improve many metrics by using a simple posterior pruning technique. We present extensive results on billion-scale LLMs (Llama and Qwen series) going way beyond the scale of existing applications of IVON. For example, we finetune a Llama-3.2-3B model on a set of commonsense reasoning tasks and improve accuracy over AdamW by 1.3% and reduce ECE by 5.4%, outperforming AdamW and other recent Bayesian methods like Laplace-LoRA and BLoB. Overall, our results show that variational learning with IVON can effectively improve LoRA finetuning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks by investigating necessary symmetries (label permutation-equivariance and feature permutation-invariance) and proving their universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph machine learning architectures lack broader applicability, prompting the need for graph foundation models that generalize across arbitrary graphs and features.

Method: The study systematically investigates symmetries (node, label, and feature permutations) and designs linear transformations respecting these symmetries, proving their universality.

Result: The proposed model shows strong zero-shot performance and consistent improvement with more training graphs, validated on 29 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The recipe provides a principled approach to building graph foundation models, demonstrating effectiveness in node property prediction.

Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in ML/AI is crucial, but existing debiasing methods struggle with doubly imbalanced datasets.

Method: Exploratory analysis of debiasing limitations, followed by a multi-criteria approach for optimal sampling and distribution.

Result: The proposed method balances fairness and classification accuracy in doubly imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: A multi-criteria solution effectively addresses fairness challenges in doubly imbalanced data.

Abstract: Fairness has been identified as an important aspect of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions for decision making. Recent literature offers a variety of approaches for debiasing, however many of them fall short when the data collection is imbalanced. In this paper, we focus on a particular case, fairness in doubly imbalanced datasets, such that the data collection is imbalanced both for the label and the groups in the sensitive attribute. Firstly, we present an exploratory analysis to illustrate limitations in debiasing on a doubly imbalanced dataset. Then, a multi-criteria based solution is proposed for finding the most suitable sampling and distribution for label and sensitive attribute, in terms of fairness and classification accuracy

*Muhammad Hamza Yousuf,Jason Li,Sahar Vahdati,Raphael Theilen,Jakob Wittenstein,Jens Lehmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AI-assisted optimization for invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) using hybrid action spaces and a clinically grounded reward function to improve patient safety and individualized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing MV settings is complex due to patient variability, and current RL methods struggle with hybrid action spaces and discretization issues.

Method: The paper adapts SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) for hybrid action spaces and introduces a reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets.

Result: The proposed approach avoids discretization pitfalls and enhances patient safety, enabling individualized lung support.

Conclusion: AI-assisted MV optimization represents a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven critical care solutions.

Abstract: Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-sustaining therapy for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, optimizing its settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for MV control, current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV actions. Discretizing the action space limits available actions due to exponential growth in combinations and introduces distribution shifts that can compromise safety. In this paper, we propose optimizations that build upon prior work in action space reduction to address the challenges of discrete action spaces. We also adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. Additionally, we introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets, which provides a more meaningful optimization objective compared to traditional sparse mortality-based rewards. Our findings demonstrate that AI-assisted MV optimization may enhance patient safety and enable individualized lung support, representing a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven critical care solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Residual connections in neural networks offer performance advantages beyond optimization, suggesting a deeper inductive bias aligned with natural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why residual networks outperform feedforward networks, beyond just improved trainability.

Method: A controlled post-training comparison isolating generalization performance from trainability, testing variable-depth vs. fixed-depth architectures.

Result: Variable-depth architectures (like ResNets) consistently outperform fixed-depth networks, even when optimization is unlikely to matter.

Conclusion: Residual connections provide inherent advantages, likely due to their alignment with natural data structure, not just optimization benefits.

Abstract: Residual connections remain ubiquitous in modern neural network architectures nearly a decade after their introduction. Their widespread adoption is often credited to their dramatically improved trainability: residual networks train faster, more stably, and achieve higher accuracy than their feedforward counterparts. While numerous techniques, ranging from improved initialization to advanced learning rate schedules, have been proposed to close the performance gap between residual and feedforward networks, this gap has persisted. In this work, we propose an alternative explanation: residual networks do not merely reparameterize feedforward networks, but instead inhabit a different function space. We design a controlled post-training comparison to isolate generalization performance from trainability; we find that variable-depth architectures, similar to ResNets, consistently outperform fixed-depth networks, even when optimization is unlikely to make a difference. These results suggest that residual connections confer performance advantages beyond optimization, pointing instead to a deeper inductive bias aligned with the structure of natural data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trust and reliability in Deep Machine Learning Models for safety-relevant applications by improving explainability and OOD detection.

Method: Uses a Variational Autoencoder to learn a latent space for distance-based classification, likelihood estimation, and reconstruction. Introduces a Gaussian mixture for ID region and a restriction loss for compactness.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on OOD detection benchmarks and a real-world railway dataset.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines explainability and OOD detection, proving useful for safety-relevant applications.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making and trusting the reliability of Deep Machine Learning Models is crucial for adopting such methods to safety-relevant applications. We extend self-explainable Prototypical Variational models with autoencoder-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection: A Variational Autoencoder is applied to learn a meaningful latent space which can be used for distance-based classification, likelihood estimation for OOD detection, and reconstruction. The In-Distribution (ID) region is defined by a Gaussian mixture distribution with learned prototypes representing the center of each mode. Furthermore, a novel restriction loss is introduced that promotes a compact ID region in the latent space without collapsing it into single points. The reconstructive capabilities of the Autoencoder ensure the explainability of the prototypes and the ID region of the classifier, further aiding the discrimination of OOD samples. Extensive evaluations on common OOD detection benchmarks as well as a large-scale dataset from a real-world railway application demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, outperforming previous methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLight is a hierarchical RL framework for large-scale traffic signal control, combining global adversarial guidance with local execution to improve coordination and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for traffic signal control struggle with scalability and global coordination, limiting their effectiveness in large networks.

Method: HiLight uses a hierarchical approach: a high-level Meta-Policy partitions the network and generates sub-goals, while a low-level Sub-Policy controls intersections with global awareness. Adversarial training aligns global planning with local execution.

Result: HiLight outperforms existing methods in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive in standard benchmarks, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: HiLight effectively addresses scalability and coordination challenges in traffic signal control, offering a robust solution for large networks.

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the need for subgroup-level evaluation of ML models in clinical decision-making to address fairness and performance disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets are noisy and imbalanced, leading to performance disparities across patient subgroups, raising fairness concerns.

Method: Analyzes medical prediction tasks to show how model performance varies with patient characteristics, emphasizing subgroup-level evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates that while ML models may perform well overall, subgroup-level disparities exist, requiring attention in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: Subgroup-sensitive evaluation is crucial for fair and transparent development and deployment of medical ML models.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to support clinical decision-making. However, real-world medical datasets are often noisy, incomplete, and imbalanced, leading to performance disparities across patient subgroups. These differences raise fairness concerns, particularly when they reinforce existing disadvantages for marginalized groups. In this work, we analyze several medical prediction tasks and demonstrate how model performance varies with patient characteristics. While ML models may demonstrate good overall performance, we argue that subgroup-level evaluation is essential before integrating them into clinical workflows. By conducting a performance analysis at the subgroup level, differences can be clearly identified-allowing, on the one hand, for performance disparities to be considered in clinical practice, and on the other hand, for these insights to inform the responsible development of more effective models. Thereby, our work contributes to a practical discussion around the subgroup-sensitive development and deployment of medical ML models and the interconnectedness of fairness and transparency.

*John Wikman,Alexandre Proutiere,David Broman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interaction layer framework and ACDA algorithm to handle unobservable, time-varying delays in RL, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL environments often have unpredictable delays, breaking MDP assumptions, but existing methods assume fixed upper bounds, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes an interaction layer framework for adaptive delay handling and develops ACDA, a model-based algorithm adjusting dynamically to delays.

Result: ACDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in locomotion benchmarks.

Conclusion: The interaction layer and ACDA effectively address delay challenges in RL, improving adaptability and performance.

Abstract: In standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings, the interaction between the agent and the environment is typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that the agent observes the system state instantaneously, selects an action without delay, and executes it immediately. In real-world dynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often breaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system. These delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically unobservable, meaning they are unknown when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with this uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the delay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the interaction layer, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively and seamlessly handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent generates a matrix of possible future actions to handle both unpredictable delays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework, we develop a model-based algorithm, Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA), which dynamically adjusts to delay patterns. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of locomotion benchmark environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel skill discovery method for unsupervised RL, focusing on inter-skill state diversity and intra-skill exploration, outperforming previous approaches in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of entropy-based exploration and empowerment-driven methods in large-scale state spaces and MI-based state exploration.

Method: Introduces a skill discovery objective maximizing state density deviation between skills, using a conditional autoencoder for state-density estimation and an intrinsic reward for intra-skill exploration.

Result: The method learns meaningful skills and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks, validated in challenging state and image-based environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances skill diversity and exploration, improving unsupervised RL performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to discover diverse behaviors that can accelerate the learning of downstream tasks. Previous methods typically focus on entropy-based exploration or empowerment-driven skill learning. However, entropy-based exploration struggles in large-scale state spaces (e.g., images), and empowerment-based methods with Mutual Information (MI) estimations have limitations in state exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skill discovery objective that maximizes the deviation of the state density of one skill from the explored regions of other skills, encouraging inter-skill state diversity similar to the initial MI objective. For state-density estimation, we construct a novel conditional autoencoder with soft modularization for different skill policies in high-dimensional space. Meanwhile, to incentivize intra-skill exploration, we formulate an intrinsic reward based on the learned autoencoder that resembles count-based exploration in a compact latent space. Through extensive experiments in challenging state and image-based tasks, we find our method learns meaningful skills and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes MoORE, a method for multi-task adaptation using Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts to avoid task conflict and oblivion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues of task conflict and oblivion in adapting large-scale foundation models for multi-task scenarios.

Method: Applies SVD to weight matrices, introduces learnable routers for task-specific adjustments, and ensures orthogonality of experts.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in multi-task adaptation, demonstrating conflict- and oblivion-resistance.

Conclusion: MoORE is superior for multi-task adaptation, maintaining original task performance while adapting to new tasks.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic neural networks struggle with computational efficiency and high-precision tasks despite their advantages in modeling hierarchical data.

Method: Simplified key operations within hyperbolic neural networks.

Result: Achieved notable improvements in runtime and predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Streamlined hyperbolic operations enhance the practicality of hyperbolic neural networks for broader use.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex, structured data, particularly where hierarchical or tree-like relationships are present. By enabling embeddings with lower distortion, hyperbolic neural networks offer promising alternatives to Euclidean-based models for capturing intricate data structures. Despite these advantages, they often face performance challenges, particularly in computational efficiency and tasks requiring high precision. In this work, we address these limitations by simplifying key operations within hyperbolic neural networks, achieving notable improvements in both runtime and performance. Our findings demonstrate that streamlined hyperbolic operations can lead to substantial gains in computational speed and predictive accuracy, making hyperbolic neural networks a more viable choice for a broader range of applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPeR method improves off-policy learning in contextual bandits by leveraging secondary rewards alongside partially-observed target rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of partial rewards in OPL, where relying solely on secondary rewards may misalign with target rewards.

Method: Proposes HyPeR, which combines secondary and target rewards for effective policy learning, even optimizing both rewards.

Result: HyPeR outperforms existing methods in synthetic and real-world data, showing better alignment and performance.

Conclusion: HyPeR effectively leverages secondary rewards to enhance OPL, even when optimizing multiple objectives benefits the target reward.

Abstract: Off-policy learning (OPL) in contextual bandits aims to learn a decision-making policy that maximizes the target rewards by using only historical interaction data collected under previously developed policies. Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially-observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward. Along with statistical analysis of our proposed methods, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data show that HyPeR outperforms existing methods in various scenarios.

TL;DR: A deep learning model (CNN) was trained to classify immune cell types using label-free multiphoton microscopy images, achieving reliable results and demonstrating potential for in vivo endomicroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-free imaging avoids staining procedures, making it ideal for in vivo use. Deep learning can enhance specificity in label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM), which is rarely explored.

Method: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on label-free MPM images of immune cells (5,075 for binary and 3,424 for multi-class classification). The squeezeNet architecture was used.

Result: Reliable classification was achieved (0.89 ROC-AUC for binary; 0.689 F1 score for six-class). Perturbation tests confirmed robustness and equal importance of AF channels (NADH and FAD).

Conclusion: DL models can computationally improve label-free MPM specificity, enabling direct immune cell detection in unstained images, with significant potential for in vivo applications.

Abstract: Label-free imaging has gained broad interest because of its potential to omit elaborate staining procedures which is especially relevant for in vivo use. Label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM), for instance, exploits two-photon excitation of natural autofluorescence (AF) from native, metabolic proteins, making it ideal for in vivo endomicroscopy. Deep learning (DL) models have been widely used in other optical imaging technologies to predict specific target annotations and thereby digitally augment the specificity of these label-free images. However, this computational specificity has only rarely been implemented for MPM. In this work, we used a data set of label-free MPM images from a series of different immune cell types (5,075 individual cells for binary classification in mixed samples and 3,424 cells for a multi-class classification task) and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cell types based on this label-free AF as input. A low-complexity squeezeNet architecture was able to achieve reliable immune cell classification results (0.89 ROC-AUC, 0.95 PR-AUC, for binary classification in mixed samples; 0.689 F1 score, 0.697 precision, 0.748 recall, and 0.683 MCC for six-class classification in isolated samples). Perturbation tests confirmed that the model is not confused by extracellular environment and that both input AF channels (NADH and FAD) are about equally important to the classification. In the future, such predictive DL models could directly detect specific immune cells in unstained images and thus, computationally improve the specificity of label-free MPM which would have great potential for in vivo endomicroscopy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Students trained on soft labels from teachers can achieve accuracy on memorized data they never saw, even in random datasets where generalization is impossible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memorized information transfers in dataset distillation, especially when teachers haven't generalized.

Method: Analyze students trained on soft labels from teachers in finite random i.i.d. datasets, isolating memorization effects.

Result: Students learn non-trivial information about held-out data, sometimes achieving perfect accuracy, depending on temperature and other factors.

Conclusion: Memorized information can transfer via soft labels, even without generalization, influenced by temperature and model settings.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to compress training data into fewer examples via a teacher, from which a student can learn effectively. While its success is often attributed to structure in the data, modern neural networks also memorize specific facts, but if and how such memorized information is can transferred in distillation settings remains less understood. In this work, we show that students trained on soft labels from teachers can achieve non-trivial accuracy on held-out memorized data they never directly observed. This effect persists on structured data when the teacher has not generalized.To analyze it in isolation, we consider finite random i.i.d. datasets where generalization is a priori impossible and a successful teacher fit implies pure memorization. Still, students can learn non-trivial information about the held-out data, in some cases up to perfect accuracy. In those settings, enough soft labels are available to recover the teacher functionally - the student matches the teacher's predictions on all possible inputs, including the held-out memorized data. We show that these phenomena strongly depend on the temperature with which the logits are smoothed, but persist across varying network capacities, architectures and dataset compositions.

### [114] [TGDPO: Harnessing Token-Level Reward Guidance for Enhancing Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14574)
*Mingkang Zhu,Xi Chen,Zhongdao Wang,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to integrate token-level reward guidance into Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by decomposing sequence-level PPO into token-level problems, improving performance over standard DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging fine-grained token-level rewards for DPO is challenging due to its sequence-level formulation, limiting its alignment capabilities with large language models.

Method: Decomposes sequence-level PPO into token-level problems, derives optimal token-level policies and rewards, and integrates them into DPO using a Bradley-Terry model.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains: 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between token-level rewards and DPO, enhancing alignment performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning from human feedback have shown that utilizing fine-grained token-level reward models can substantially enhance the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in aligning large language models. However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning is effective for mental health analytics, aiding early detection and intervention.

Abstract: Depression is a significant mental health concern, particularly in professional environments where work-related stress, financial pressure, and lifestyle imbalances contribute to deteriorating well-being. Despite increasing awareness, researchers and practitioners face critical challenges in developing accurate and generalizable predictive models for mental health disorders. Traditional classification approaches often struggle with the complexity of depression, as it is influenced by multifaceted, interdependent factors, including occupational stress, sleep patterns, and job satisfaction. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a stacking-based ensemble learning approach to improve the predictive accuracy of depression classification among professionals. The Depression Professional Dataset has been collected from Kaggle. The dataset comprises demographic, occupational, and lifestyle attributes that influence mental well-being. Our stacking model integrates multiple base learners with a logistic regression-mediated model, effectively capturing diverse learning patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high predictive performance, with an accuracy of 99.64% on training data and 98.75% on testing data, with precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 98%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning in mental health analytics and underscore its potential for early detection and intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the connection between ZOO methods and RL paradigms like PO, and improve ZOO algorithms by leveraging PO insights.

Method: Established equivalence between ZOO and single-step PO, proposed ZoAR with averaged baseline and query reuse for variance reduction.

Result: ZoAR outperforms other ZOO methods in convergence speed and final performance, validated by empirical studies.

Conclusion: The work provides a new theoretical understanding of ZOO and practical improvements through its connection to PO.

Abstract: Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO) provides powerful tools for optimizing functions where explicit gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. However, the underlying mechanisms of popular ZOO methods, particularly those employing randomized finite differences, and their connection to other optimization paradigms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are not fully elucidated. This paper establishes a fundamental and previously unrecognized connection: ZOO with finite differences is equivalent to a specific instance of single-step Policy Optimization (PO). We formally unveil that the implicitly smoothed objective function optimized by common ZOO algorithms is identical to a single-step PO objective. Furthermore, we show that widely used ZOO gradient estimators, are mathematically equivalent to the REINFORCE gradient estimator with a specific baseline function, revealing the variance-reducing mechanism in ZOO from a PO perspective.Built on this unified framework, we propose ZoAR (Zeroth-Order Optimization with Averaged Baseline and Query Reuse), a novel ZOO algorithm incorporating PO-inspired variance reduction techniques: an averaged baseline from recent evaluations and query reuse analogous to experience replay. Our theoretical analysis further substantiates these techniques reduce variance and enhance convergence. Extensive empirical studies validate our theory and demonstrate that ZoAR significantly outperforms other methods in terms of convergence speed and final performance. Overall, our work provides a new theoretical lens for understanding ZOO and offers practical algorithmic improvements derived from its connection to PO.

TL;DR: A hypernetwork architecture improves global electrical consumption forecasting by leveraging external factors like weather, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting is vital for energy management, but adding external factors often degrades global model performance.

Method: Used a hypernetwork to adjust model weights per consumer, tested on a dataset of 6000+ Luxembourgish households with external factors.

Result: Hypernetwork outperformed other models, reducing errors and maintaining global model benefits.

Conclusion: Hypernetworks effectively enhance global forecasting accuracy by incorporating external factors.

Abstract: Accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and resource allocation. While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer.
  We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for selectively removing specific information from trained models due to privacy regulations, avoiding full retraining.

Method: FAMR frames unlearning as constrained optimization with uniform-prediction loss and ℓ2 penalty to anchor parameters. Theoretical analysis links it to influence-function-based retraining.

Result: Effective class forgetting on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, with strong performance retention and low computational overhead.

Conclusion: FAMR offers a scalable, certifiable solution for post-hoc unlearning in vision models, generalizing to concept and style erasure.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly rely on data subject to privacy regulation, selectively unlearning specific information from trained models has become essential. In image classification, this involves removing the influence of particular training samples, semantic classes, or visual styles without full retraining. We introduce \textbf{Forget-Aligned Model Reconstruction (FAMR)}, a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient framework for post-hoc unlearning in deep image classifiers. FAMR frames forgetting as a constrained optimization problem that minimizes a uniform-prediction loss on the forget set while anchoring model parameters to their original values via an $\ell_2$ penalty. A theoretical analysis links FAMR's solution to influence-function-based retraining approximations, with bounds on parameter and output deviation. Empirical results on class forgetting tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate FAMR's effectiveness, with strong performance retention and minimal computational overhead. The framework generalizes naturally to concept and style erasure, offering a scalable and certifiable route to efficient post-hoc forgetting in vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the applicability of Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) in adversarial game settings and improve efficiency by leveraging the ε-Nash Equilibrium property.

Method: Proposes ETC-TPZSG and its enhanced version ETC-TPZSG-AE, which uses action pair elimination for better performance.

Result: Achieves instance-dependent regret bounds of O(Δ + √T) for ETC-TPZSG and O(log(TΔ²)/Δ) for ETC-TPZSG-AE.

Conclusion: ETC-based algorithms are effective in adversarial settings, offering competitive regret bounds and insights through instance-dependent analysis.

Abstract: We study a two-player zero-sum game (TPZSG) in which the row player aims to maximize their payoff against an adversarial column player, under an unknown payoff matrix estimated through bandit feedback. We propose and analyze two algorithms: ETC-TPZSG, which directly applies ETC to the TPZSG setting and ETC-TPZSG-AE, which improves upon it by incorporating an action pair elimination (AE) strategy that leverages the $\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium property to efficiently select the optimal action pair. Our objective is to demonstrate the applicability of ETC in a TPZSG setting by focusing on learning pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. A key contribution of our work is a derivation of instance-dependent upper bounds on the expected regret for both algorithms, has received limited attention in the literature on zero-sum games. Particularly, after $T$ rounds, we achieve an instance-dependent regret upper bounds of $O(Δ+ \sqrt{T})$ for ETC-TPZSG and $O(\frac{\log (T Δ^2)}Δ)$ for ETC-TPZSG-AE, where $Δ$ denotes the suboptimality gap. Therefore, our results indicate that ETC-based algorithms perform effectively in adversarial game settings, achieving regret bounds comparable to existing methods while providing insights through instance-dependent analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques existing visual counterfactual explainers (VCEs) for focusing too narrowly on sample quality or minimal changes, neglecting broader explanation goals like fidelity, understandability, and sufficiency. It introduces a new 'smooth counterfactual explorer' (SCE) algorithm to address these gaps and validates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCEs prioritize sample quality or minimal changes but overlook holistic explanation needs like fidelity and understandability, limiting their practical utility.

Method: The paper explores new counterfactual generation mechanisms and integrates them into the novel SCE algorithm.

Result: Systematic evaluations on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the SCE algorithm.

Conclusion: The SCE algorithm addresses the shortcomings of existing VCEs by better fulfilling desiderata like fidelity and understandability, enhancing the transparency of image classifiers.

Abstract: Visual counterfactual explainers (VCEs) are a straightforward and promising approach to enhancing the transparency of image classifiers. VCEs complement other types of explanations, such as feature attribution, by revealing the specific data transformations to which a machine learning model responds most strongly. In this paper, we argue that existing VCEs focus too narrowly on optimizing sample quality or change minimality; they fail to consider the more holistic desiderata for an explanation, such as fidelity, understandability, and sufficiency. To address this shortcoming, we explore new mechanisms for counterfactual generation and investigate how they can help fulfill these desiderata. We combine these mechanisms into a novel 'smooth counterfactual explorer' (SCE) algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through systematic evaluations on synthetic and real data.

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating clinical decision support systems prioritizes calibration, robustness, and cost sensitivity over traditional metrics like accuracy and AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scoring rules (e.g., accuracy, AUC-ROC) inadequately address clinical priorities like calibration, robustness, and asymmetric error costs.

Method: Proposes an adjusted cross-entropy variant (log score) based on proper scoring rules, averaging cost-weighted performance over relevant class balances.

Result: The framework is simple, sensitive to clinical conditions, and prioritizes calibrated, robust models.

Conclusion: The method improves model selection for clinical settings by aligning evaluation with real-world priorities.

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

Motivation: To address challenges in modeling human movement with limited data and high interpretability, especially in medical applications like prosthesis control.

Method: Combines multiple Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) in a probabilistic mixture-of-experts framework, using geometric features for diverse sequence encoding.

Result: GPDMM excels in classification accuracy and generative ability in single-example learning, outperforming LSTMs, VAEs, and transformers.

Conclusion: GPDMM is effective for human motion modeling in data-limited, interpretability-critical scenarios, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We present the Gaussian process dynamical mixture model (GPDMM) and show its utility in single-example learning of human motion data. The Gaussian process dynamical model (GPDM) is a form of the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM), but optimized with a hidden Markov model dynamical prior. The GPDMM combines multiple GPDMs in a probabilistic mixture-of-experts framework, utilizing embedded geometric features to allow for diverse sequences to be encoded in a single latent space, enabling the categorization and generation of each sequence class. GPDMs and our mixture model are particularly advantageous in addressing the challenges of modeling human movement in scenarios where data is limited and model interpretability is vital, such as in patient-specific medical applications like prosthesis control. We score the GPDMM on classification accuracy and generative ability in single-example learning, showcase model variations, and benchmark it against LSTMs, VAEs, and transformers.

Our architecture consists of neural and symbolic components. The former segments and encodes images into facts using object-centric learning, while the latter applies ABA learning to develop ABA frameworks enabling predictions with images. Experiments on synthetic data show that the NAL architecture can be competitive with a state-of-the-art alternative.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCISSOR is a debiasing method that addresses semantic shortcut learning in models, improving generalization without data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut learning harms model generalization due to spurious semantic correlations, which SCISSOR aims to mitigate.

Method: SCISSOR uses a Siamese network to remap the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts.

Result: SCISSOR improves F1 scores by +5.3 to +7.7 across 4 benchmarks and boosts lightweight models by ~9.5-11.9%.

Conclusion: SCISSOR redefines model generalization by tackling semantic biases, offering a robust framework for bias-resistant AI.

Abstract: Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of real-time identification and quantification of greenhouse-gas emissions under dynamic atmospheric conditions.

Method: A spatio-temporal inversion framework using a deep-learning surrogate (multilayer perceptron) trained on CFD data, integrated with sequential Monte Carlo for Bayesian inference.

Result: Validated on methane release data, showing accuracy comparable to CFD and Gaussian plume models but with much faster runtimes. Robust in complex environments.

Conclusion: The framework balances physical fidelity and computational efficiency, offering a scalable solution for real-time emissions monitoring.

Abstract: Real-time identification and quantification of greenhouse-gas emissions under transient atmospheric conditions is a critical challenge in environmental monitoring. We introduce a spatio-temporal inversion framework that embeds a deep-learning surrogate of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Bayesian inference of both emission rate and source location in dynamic flow fields. By substituting costly numerical solvers with a multilayer perceptron trained on high-fidelity CFD outputs, our surrogate captures spatial heterogeneity and temporal evolution of gas dispersion, while delivering near-real-time predictions. Validation on the Chilbolton methane release dataset demonstrates comparable accuracy to full CFD solvers and Gaussian plume models, yet achieves orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes. Further experiments under simulated obstructed-flow scenarios confirm robustness in complex environments. This work reconciles physical fidelity with computational feasibility, offering a scalable solution for industrial emissions monitoring and other time-sensitive spatio-temporal inversion tasks in environmental and scientific modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel likelihood-based distribution matching method using score-based priors is introduced, addressing scalability, instability, and bias issues in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DM methods face challenges like scalability, instability, and bias from fixed priors or explicit density models.

Method: The approach trains likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based priors, leveraging gradient-based training and denoising score matching to avoid biases and explicit density modeling.

Result: The method shows better stability, computational efficiency, and superior performance across tasks compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The score-based method is a stable and effective solution for distribution matching, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Distribution matching (DM) is a versatile domain-invariant representation learning technique that has been applied to tasks such as fair classification, domain adaptation, and domain translation. Non-parametric DM methods struggle with scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode collapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they often impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit density models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this limitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that gradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its density -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This approach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more effective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the challenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based prior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational efficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). Furthermore, experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to distribution matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuRBO is a Bayesian optimization algorithm that efficiently handles expensive constraints in high-dimensional spaces by adaptively shifting and resizing trust regions to quickly find feasible solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with costly constraints in high-dimensional spaces, often spending too much budget locating feasible solutions.

Method: FuRBO uses an adaptive trust region strategy, leveraging objective and constraint surrogate models to iteratively select candidate solutions.

Result: FuRBO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in constrained black-box optimization, tested on BBOB-constrained COCO and physics-inspired benchmarks.

Conclusion: FuRBO accelerates feasible solution discovery and improves optimization effectiveness in constrained, high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for solving real-world optimization tasks under tight evaluation budgets, making it well-suited for applications involving costly simulations or experiments. However, many of these tasks are also characterized by the presence of expensive constraints whose analytical formulation is unknown and often defined in high-dimensional spaces where feasible regions are small, irregular, and difficult to identify. In such cases, a substantial portion of the optimization budget may be spent just trying to locate the first feasible solution, limiting the effectiveness of existing methods. In this work, we present a Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) algorithm. FuRBO iteratively defines a trust region from which the next candidate solution is selected, using information from both the objective and constraint surrogate models. Our adaptive strategy allows the trust region to shift and resize significantly between iterations, enabling the optimizer to rapidly refocus its search and consistently accelerate the discovery of feasible and good-quality solutions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FuRBO through extensive testing on the full BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite and other physics-inspired benchmarks, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines for constrained black-box optimization across varying levels of constraint severity and problem dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 60.

TL;DR: The paper explores bandit learnability, showing no combinatorial dimension can characterize it and revealing computational hardness in finding optimal actions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a general theory of bandit learnability, akin to PAC classification, and understand which function classes are learnable and how.

Method: Investigates learnability via combinatorial dimensions and computational hardness proofs, including constructing a reward function class for analysis.

Result: No combinatorial dimension characterizes bandit learnability; computational hardness exists even for simple cases, with efficient algorithms for standard operations.

Conclusion: Bandit learnability has inherent limitations and computational challenges, distinct from classical learning frameworks.

Abstract: We study the task of bandit learning, also known as best-arm identification, under the assumption that the true reward function f belongs to a known, but arbitrary, function class F. We seek a general theory of bandit learnability, akin to the PAC framework for classification. Our investigation is guided by the following two questions: (1) which classes F are learnable, and (2) how they are learnable. For example, in the case of binary PAC classification, learnability is fully determined by a combinatorial dimension - the VC dimension- and can be attained via a simple algorithmic principle, namely, empirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast to classical learning-theoretic results, our findings reveal limitations of learning in structured bandits, offering insights into the boundaries of bandit learnability. First, for the question of "which", we show that the paradigm of identifying the learnable classes via a dimension-like quantity fails for bandit learning. We give a simple proof demonstrating that no combinatorial dimension can characterize bandit learnability, even in finite classes, following a standard definition of dimension introduced by Ben-David et al. (2019). For the question of "how", we prove a computational hardness result: we construct a reward function class for which at most two queries are needed to find the optimal action, yet no algorithm can do so in polynomial time unless RP=NP. We also prove that this class admits efficient algorithms for standard algorithmic operations often considered in learning theory, such as an ERM. This implies that computational hardness is in this case inherent to the task of bandit learning. Beyond these results, we investigate additional themes such as learning under noise, trade-offs between noise models, and the relationship between query complexity and regret minimization.

### [131] [Non-planar Object Detection and Identification by Features Matching and Triangulation Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13769)
*Filippo Leveni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feature-based method for detecting and identifying distorted objects in images using incremental grouping of feature matches and Delaunay triangulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection is vital for applications like tracking and robotics, but existing methods struggle with non-planar or distorted objects.

Method: Uses Delaunay triangulation of template features to guide iterative grouping of matches, evaluating local consistency based on geometric and photometric properties.

Result: Outperforms homography-based RANSAC in scenarios with significant distortion while matching performance in minimal distortion cases.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles non-planar or distorted objects, offering robust detection where traditional geometric models fail.

Abstract: Object detection and identification is surely a fundamental topic in the computer vision field; it plays a crucial role in many applications such as object tracking, industrial robots control, image retrieval, etc. We propose a feature-based approach for detecting and identifying distorted occurrences of a given template in a scene image by incremental grouping of feature matches between the image and the template. For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image. We show that our approach performs just as well or better than application of homography-based RANSAC in scenarios in which distortion is nearly absent, while when the deformation becomes relevant our method shows better description performance.

*Shiwen Zhang,Zhuowei Chen,Lang Chen,Yanze Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDST is a two-stream style transfer method that isolates color from style, enabling universal, tuning-free style transfer with improved similarity and editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving characteristics in style transfer while isolating color from style, enabling universal and tuning-free capabilities.

Method: Uses a two-stream training paradigm (color and style streams), multi-feature image embeddings compression, and a new style definition inspired by Diffusion UNet disentanglement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in style similarity and editing capability, validated by qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: CDST provides a novel, efficient solution for universal style transfer, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Color Disentangled Style Transfer (CDST), a novel and efficient two-stream style transfer training paradigm which completely isolates color from style and forces the style stream to be color-blinded. With one same model, CDST unlocks universal style transfer capabilities in a tuning-free manner during inference. Especially, the characteristics-preserved style transfer with style and content references is solved in the tuning-free way for the first time. CDST significantly improves the style similarity by multi-feature image embeddings compression and preserves strong editing capability via our new CDST style definition inspired by Diffusion UNet disentanglement law. By conducting thorough qualitative and quantitative experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that CDST achieves state-of-the-art results on various style transfer tasks.

*Sedat Porikli,Vedat Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines biases in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, revealing disparities in gender, race, age, and other human-centric factors in generated images, often reinforcing harmful stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate societal biases replicated and magnified by T2I models in visual content creation.

Method: Curated diverse prompts across 160 topics, generated over 16,000 images using Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Flux-1 models, and compared with 8,000 Google Image Search results. Filtered outputs for clarity.

Result: Significant disparities in representation of gender, race, age, and somatotype were found, often mirroring societal stereotypes.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for inclusive datasets and development practices to ensure fairness in generative visual systems.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have transformed visual content creation, producing highly realistic images from natural language prompts. However, concerns persist around their potential to replicate and magnify existing societal biases. To investigate these issues, we curated a diverse set of prompts spanning thematic categories such as occupations, traits, actions, ideologies, emotions, family roles, place descriptions, spirituality, and life events. For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images. These disparities often mirror and reinforce harmful stereotypes embedded in societal narratives. We discuss the implications of these findings and emphasize the need for more inclusive datasets and development practices to foster fairness in generative visual systems.

TL;DR: GAN-RM is a reward modeling framework for reinforcement learning in visual generative models, eliminating manual preference annotation and explicit quality engineering by using adversarial training with minimal target samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward modeling approaches are complex due to reliance on human-annotated data or engineered quality dimensions, which are incomplete and labor-intensive.

Method: GAN-RM trains a reward model by discriminating between unpaired target samples (Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated outputs, requiring only a few hundred samples.

Result: GAN-RM is effective in applications like Best-of-N filtering, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Conclusion: GAN-RM offers a simpler, efficient alternative to traditional reward modeling, reducing reliance on manual annotation and engineering.

Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

*Thomas Kreutz,Max Mühlhäuser,Alejandro Sanchez Guinea*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeSPITE introduces a multi-modal contrastive pre-training model for human activity understanding, combining LiDAR, skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored use of LiDAR in multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding.

Method: DeSPITE learns joint embeddings across LiDAR point clouds, skeleton poses, IMU data, and text using noise contrastive estimation, leveraging synchronized data from LIPD and Babel datasets.

Result: Enables novel tasks like Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching and retrieval, and proves effective for point cloud HAR pre-training.

Conclusion: DeSPITE successfully bridges the gap in multi-modal human activity understanding, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.

Abstract: Despite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) being an effective privacy-preserving alternative to RGB cameras to perceive human activities, it remains largely underexplored in the context of multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding (e.g., human activity recognition (HAR), retrieval, or person re-identification (RE-ID)). To close this gap, our work explores learning the correspondence between LiDAR point clouds, human skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space. More specifically, we present DeSPITE, a Deep Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU-Text Embedding model, which effectively learns a joint embedding space across these four modalities through noise contrastive estimation. At the heart of our empirical exploration, we have combined the existing LIPD and Babel datasets, which enabled us to synchronize data of all four modalities, allowing us to explore the learning of a new joint embedding space. Our experiments demonstrate novel human activity understanding tasks for point cloud sequences enabled through DeSPITE, including Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval. Furthermore, we show that DeSPITE is an effective pre-training strategy for point cloud HAR through experiments in MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR.

*Raymond Yu,Paul Han,Josh Myers-Dean,Piper Wolters,Favyen Bastani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPTIMUS is a self-supervised learning method for detecting long-lasting changes in satellite imagery without labeled data, improving AUROC scores significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of annotated satellite data for rare change detection due to sparse occurrences of changes.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning by recovering the relative order of images in a time series to detect persistent changes.

Result: Achieves an AUROC improvement from 56.3% to 87.6% in distinguishing changed time series.

Conclusion: OPTIMUS effectively detects changes in satellite imagery without labeled data, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: In the face of pressing environmental issues in the 21st century, monitoring surface changes on Earth is more important than ever. Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines. Our code and dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimus-change/optimus-dataset/.

Training is conducted on a diverse customized datasets with frame-level annotations, incorporating videos from surveillance cameras, human recordings, hockey fight, sohas and wvd dataset across various platforms. Additionally, a camera module integrated with raspberry pi is used to capture live video feed, which is sent to the ML model for processing.

*Numair Nadeem,Saeed Anwar,Muhammad Hamza Asad,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierVL integrates vision-language models into semi-supervised segmentation, improving performance under severe label scarcity and domain variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of vision-only methods in generalization and boundary localization, and leveraging vision-language models for robust semantics.

Method: HierVL combines hierarchical semantic query generation, cross-modal spatial alignment, and dual-query transformer decoding with targeted regularization losses.

Result: Achieves significant improvements (up to +5.9%) in IoU on benchmark datasets under 1% supervision.

Conclusion: Language-guided segmentation enhances label efficiency and fine-grained, instance-aware generalization.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation remains challenging under severe label scarcity and domain variability. Vision-only methods often struggle to generalize, resulting in pixel misclassification between similar classes, poor generalization and boundary localization. Vision-Language Models offer robust, domain-invariant semantics but lack the spatial grounding required for dense prediction. We introduce HierVL, a unified framework that bridges this gap by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture tailored for semi-supervised segmentation. HierVL features three novel components: a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator that filters and projects abstract class embeddings into multi-scale queries to suppress irrelevant classes and handle intra-class variability; a Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module that aligns semantic queries with pixel features for sharper boundaries under sparse supervision; and a Dual-Query Transformer Decoder that fuses semantic and instance-level queries to prevent instance collapse. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision-language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic grounding. HierVL establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving a +4.4% mean improvement of the intersection over the union on COCO (with 232 labeled images), +3.1% on Pascal VOC (with 92 labels), +5.9% on ADE20 (with 158 labels) and +1.8% on Cityscapes (with 100 labels), demonstrating better performance under 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation closes the label efficiency gap and unlocks new levels of fine-grained, instance-aware generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps hampers effective agricultural landscape management for biodiversity targets.

Method: A deep learning segmentation model trained on 942 manually annotated aerial imagery tiles was used to generate the map.

Result: The model achieved high F1-scores for woodland (96%) and farmed land (95%), with 72% for hedgerows. The map is available on Google Earth Engine.

Conclusion: Farmscapes provides an open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers, supporting habitat restoration and biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.

*Daniel Montoya,Aymen Bouguerra,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Fabio Arnez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques current OOD-OD evaluation protocols for violating non-overlapping assumptions and introduces a manually curated benchmark with new splits (near, far, farther) and metrics for better assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting unknown objects is critical for safety in domains like autonomous driving, but current OOD-OD evaluations are flawed, leading to overconfidence in deployment.

Method: The authors manually curate and enrich benchmarks using semantic similarity, creating splits (near, far, farther) and incorporating Open Set metrics.

Result: Semantically/visually close OOD objects are easier to localize but more confusable with ID objects; far/farther objects are harder to localize but less confusable.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and metrics provide deeper insights into OOD detection performance, addressing limitations of current protocols.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Object Detection (OD) methods predominantly operate under a closed-world assumption, where test-time categories match those encountered during training. However, detecting and localizing unknown objects is crucial for safety-critical applications in domains such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. Recently, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a vital research direction for OD, focusing on identifying incorrect predictions typically associated with unknown objects. This paper shows that the current evaluation protocol for OOD-OD violates the assumption of non-overlapping objects with respect to the In-Distribution (ID) datasets, and obscures crucial situations such as ignoring unknown objects, potentially leading to overconfidence in deployment scenarios where truly novel objects might be encountered. To address these limitations, we manually curate, and enrich the existing benchmark by exploiting semantic similarity to create new evaluation splits categorized as $\textit{near}$, $\textit{far}$, and $\textit{farther}$ from ID distributions. Additionally, we incorporate established metrics from the Open Set community, providing deeper insights into how effectively methods detect unknowns, when they ignore them, and when they mistakenly classify OOD objects as ID. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize than far ones, but are also more easily confounded with ID objects. $\textit{Far}$ and $\textit{farther}$ objects are harder to localize but less prone to be taken for an ID object.

*Nick Yiwen Huang,Akin Caliskan,Berkay Kicanaoglu,James Tompkin,Hyeongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangling 3D control from large vision-language models for generative 3D portraits, enabling text and geometry control without additional labels or large training resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable free-form text and 3D geometry control of generative 3D portraits using pre-trained models and small datasets, avoiding the need for extensive labeling or training.

Method: Uses canonicalization to disentangle 2D reference frames from a 3D triplane representation and employs Jacobian regularization to mitigate noise in the LVLM's embedding space.

Result: Produces portraits with consistent text and 3D control, overcoming noise-related quality and diversity issues.

Conclusion: This approach allows creators to control 3D generators using their own 2D data without requiring large labeled datasets or model training.

Abstract: We consider the problem of disentangling 3D from large vision-language models, which we show on generative 3D portraits. This allows free-form text control of appearance attributes like age, hair style, and glasses, and 3D geometry control of face expression and camera pose. In this setting, we assume we use a pre-trained large vision-language model (LVLM; CLIP) to generate from a smaller 2D dataset with no additional paired labels and with a pre-defined 3D morphable model (FLAME). First, we disentangle using canonicalization to a 2D reference frame from a deformable neural 3D triplane representation. But another form of entanglement arises from the significant noise in the LVLM's embedding space that describes irrelevant features. This damages output quality and diversity, but we overcome this with a Jacobian regularization that can be computed efficiently with a stochastic approximator. Compared to existing methods, our approach produces portraits with added text and 3D control, where portraits remain consistent when either control is changed. Broadly, this approach lets creators control 3D generators on their own 2D face data without needing resources to label large data or train large models.

TL;DR: SimpleDoc is a lightweight retrieval-augmented framework for DocVQA that improves evidence retrieval and answer generation by combining embedding similarity and page summaries, outperforming baselines by 3.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DocVQA is challenging due to multi-modality and multi-page references. Existing methods use VLMs but lack efficiency. SimpleDoc aims to enhance retrieval and answer accuracy with fewer pages.

Method: SimpleDoc uses a dual-cue retriever (embedding similarity + page summaries) and a VLM-based reasoner agent to iteratively gather evidence until confident answers are generated.

Result: SimpleDoc outperforms baselines by 3.2% on average across 4 DocVQA datasets, retrieving fewer pages.

Conclusion: SimpleDoc is an efficient and effective framework for DocVQA, improving retrieval and answer generation with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a practical yet challenging task, which is to ask questions based on documents while referring to multiple pages and different modalities of information, e.g, images and tables. To handle multi-modality, recent methods follow a similar Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, but utilize Visual Language Models (VLMs) based embedding model to embed and retrieve relevant pages as images, and generate answers with VLMs that can accept an image as input. In this paper, we introduce SimpleDoc, a lightweight yet powerful retrieval - augmented framework for DocVQA. It boosts evidence page gathering by first retrieving candidates through embedding similarity and then filtering and re-ranking these candidates based on page summaries. A single VLM-based reasoner agent repeatedly invokes this dual-cue retriever, iteratively pulling fresh pages into a working memory until the question is confidently answered. SimpleDoc outperforms previous baselines by 3.2% on average on 4 DocVQA datasets with much fewer pages retrieved. Our code is available at https://github.com/ag2ai/SimpleDoc.

*Siyu Xu,Wenjie Li,Guangwei Gao,Jian Yang,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network, improves face super-resolution by separately processing low- and high-frequency facial features using Mamba and CNN, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSR methods treat all facial pixels equally, leading to inefficient resource use and degraded performance. CNN excels at high-frequency features, while Mamba handles low-frequency features more efficiently.

Method: FADPNet decomposes facial features into low- and high-frequency components. It uses a Mamba-based LFEB for low-frequency features and a CNN-based DPA module with HFR for high-frequency features.

Result: The method achieves superior FSR quality and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: FADPNet effectively balances performance and computational cost by leveraging the strengths of Mamba and CNN for different frequency components.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) under limited computational costs remains an open problem. Existing approaches typically treat all facial pixels equally, resulting in suboptimal allocation of computational resources and degraded FSR performance. CNN is relatively sensitive to high-frequency facial features, such as component contours and facial outlines. Meanwhile, Mamba excels at capturing low-frequency features like facial color and fine-grained texture, and does so with lower complexity than Transformers. Motivated by these observations, we propose FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network that decomposes facial features into low- and high-frequency components and processes them via dedicated branches. For low-frequency regions, we introduce a Mamba-based Low-Frequency Enhancement Block (LFEB), which combines state-space attention with squeeze-and-excitation operations to extract low-frequency global interactions and emphasize informative channels. For high-frequency regions, we design a CNN-based Deep Position-Aware Attention (DPA) module to enhance spatially-dependent structural details, complemented by a lightweight High-Frequency Refinement (HFR) module that further refines frequency-specific representations. Through the above designs, our method achieves an excellent balance between FSR quality and model efficiency, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing accuracy and real-time inference in MOS for autonomous driving.

Method: Uses a BEV projection-based student model and a non-projection teacher model, decouples moving/non-moving classes, applies tailored distillation, dynamic upsampling, and optimizes architecture.

Result: Achieves 78.8% IoU on SemanticKITTI-MOS, reduces false positives/negatives, and cuts parameters by 7.69%.

Conclusion: The framework improves MOS accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency, validated on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Motion Object Segmentation (MOS) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enhances localization, path planning, map construction, scene flow estimation, and future state prediction. While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS, aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency. Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling, optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter count, mitigating overfitting. Our method achieves a notable IoU of 78.8% on the hidden test set of the SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset and delivers competitive results on the Apollo dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore BiomedCLIP's embedding space and quantify its limitations on imbalanced, out-of-distribution medical data.

Method: Experiments on the IU-xray dataset using zero-shot inference, full fine-tuning, and linear probing, with evaluation via Grad-CAM heatmaps and radiologist annotations.

Result: Zero-shot settings over-predict labels, while fine-tuning improves disease classification. Linear probing detects overlapping features.

Conclusion: Careful model adaptation is needed for reliable real-world application, with code available on GitHub.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct two research objectives: i) explore the learned embedding space of BiomedCLIP, an open-source large vision language model, to analyse meaningful class separations, and ii) quantify the limitations of BiomedCLIP when applied to a highly imbalanced, out-of-distribution multi-label medical dataset. We experiment on IU-xray dataset, which exhibits the aforementioned criteria, and evaluate BiomedCLIP in classifying images (radiographs) in three contexts: zero-shot inference, full finetuning, and linear probing. The results show that the model under zero-shot settings over-predicts all labels, leading to poor precision and inter-class separability. Full fine-tuning improves classification of distinct diseases, while linear probing detects overlapping features. We demonstrate visual understanding of the model using Grad-CAM heatmaps and compare with 15 annotations by a radiologist. We highlight the need for careful adaptations of the models to foster reliability and applicability in a real-world setting. The code for the experiments in this work is available and maintained on GitHub.

Conclusion: RadFabric enhances AI-driven radiology with transparent, anatomically precise, and clinically actionable CXR analysis.

Abstract: Chest X ray (CXR) imaging remains a critical diagnostic tool for thoracic conditions, but current automated systems face limitations in pathology coverage, diagnostic accuracy, and integration of visual and textual reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose RadFabric, a multi agent, multimodal reasoning framework that unifies visual and textual analysis for comprehensive CXR interpretation. RadFabric is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling modularity, interoperability, and scalability for seamless integration of new diagnostic agents. The system employs specialized CXR agents for pathology detection, an Anatomical Interpretation Agent to map visual findings to precise anatomical structures, and a Reasoning Agent powered by large multimodal reasoning models to synthesize visual, anatomical, and clinical data into transparent and evidence based diagnoses. RadFabric achieves significant performance improvements, with near-perfect detection of challenging pathologies like fractures (1.000 accuracy) and superior overall diagnostic accuracy (0.799) compared to traditional systems (0.229 to 0.527). By integrating cross modal feature alignment and preference-driven reasoning, RadFabric advances AI-driven radiology toward transparent, anatomically precise, and clinically actionable CXR analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAware improves pedestrian trajectory prediction by incorporating scene understanding, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on social interactions but neglect environmental context, which significantly impacts pedestrian movement.

Method: Uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) scene encoder and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for walkability masks, combined with a Transformer-based trajectory encoder and collision penalties.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ETH/UCY datasets, with consistent performance across trajectory types.

Conclusion: Explicit scene information is crucial for accurate and physically plausible trajectory predictions.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is essential for applications in robotics and surveillance systems. While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the under-researched potential of masked autoregressive models for video generation and address challenges like long sequence modeling.

Method: Proposes VideoMAR with temporal causality, spatial bi-directionality, next-frame diffusion loss, curriculum learning, and progressive resolution training.

Result: Outperforms Cosmos I2V on VBench-I2V with fewer parameters, training data, and GPU resources.

Conclusion: VideoMAR is a concise, efficient, and scalable solution for autoregressive video generation, replicating language model capabilities in video.

Abstract: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

*Shulong Zhang,Mingyuan Yao,Jiayin Zhao,Xiao Liu,Haihua Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAINet, a multi-stage augmented multimodal interaction network, to improve fish feeding intensity assessment in aquaculture by enhancing feature extraction, inter-modal interaction, and decision-making fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing fish feeding intensity in aquaculture are limited in accuracy and reliability due to poor modality selection, feature extraction, and decision-making fusion.

Method: MAINet introduces a general feature extraction framework, an ARPM mechanism for inter-modal interaction (using CAFN and DAFN), and an ER rule for decision fusion.

Result: MAINet achieves high accuracy (96.76%), precision (96.78%), recall (96.79%), and F1-Score (96.79%), outperforming single-modality and other fusion models.

Conclusion: MAINet significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of fish feeding intensity quantification, validated by ablation experiments.

Abstract: In recirculating aquaculture systems, accurate and effective assessment of fish feeding intensity is crucial for reducing feed costs and calculating optimal feeding times. However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments further verified the key role of the proposed improvement strategy in improving the robustness and feature utilization efficiency of model, which can effectively improve the accuracy of the quantitative results of fish feeding intensity.

Motivation: Existing methods neglect unique characteristics of pathological images, causing inefficiencies, especially in edge-computing.

Method: Proposed Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) and integrated domain adaptation into one-shot NAS.

Result: Outperformed existing approaches on BRACS dataset, achieving better classification and feature localization.

Conclusion: The method enhances stability and adaptability in pathological image analysis, offering clinical relevance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based pathological image analysis presents unique challenges due to the practical constraints of network design. Most existing methods apply computer vision models directly to medical tasks, neglecting the distinct characteristics of pathological images. This mismatch often leads to computational inefficiencies, particularly in edge-computing scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) strategy to improve the stability of neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, we introduce domain adaptation into one-shot NAS to better handle variations in staining and semantic scale across pathology datasets. Experiments on the BRACS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, delivering both superior classification performance and clinically relevant feature localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Meta-SurDiff, a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model, addresses uncertainty in surgical videos for reliable online phase recognition by tackling frame ambiguity and unbalanced phase distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in surgical videos (frame ambiguity and unbalanced phase distribution) is often overlooked but crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition.

Method: Uses a classification diffusion model for finer-grained frame-level confidence assessment and meta-learning to enhance robustness of classification boundaries.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on five datasets (Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, NurViD) using multiple practical metrics.

Conclusion: Meta-SurDiff improves online surgical phase recognition by addressing uncertainty, with code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Online surgical phase recognition has drawn great attention most recently due to its potential downstream applications closely related to human life and health. Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries. We will release the code upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset for egocentric human-object interaction (Ego-HOI) detection, addressing gaps in existing third-person HOI methods. It proposes a Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR) scheme to improve detection by leveraging hand pose and geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods focus on third-person views, neglecting the egocentric perspective (Ego-HOI). The paper aims to fill this gap by introducing a dataset and adapting methods to address challenges like hand-occluded objects and complex hand interactions.

Method: The authors propose the HGIR scheme, which extracts global hand geometric features from hand pose proposals and refines interaction-specific features using pose-interaction attention. This lightweight approach is designed to enhance Ego-HOI detection.

Result: The HGIR scheme significantly improves Ego-HOI detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on the new Ego-HOIBench dataset, which includes 27K annotated images across 123 interaction categories.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the limitations of third-person HOI methods by introducing Ego-HOIBench and the HGIR scheme, demonstrating improved performance and versatility in egocentric interaction detection.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between humans and objects has gained much attention in recent years. Existing human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods mainly focus on the third-person perspectives, overlooking a more intuitive way from the egocentric view of HOI, namely Ego-HOI. This paper introduces an Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset to promote the benchmarking and development of Ego-HOI detection. Our Ego-HOIBench comprises more than 27K egocentric images with high-quality hand-verb-object triplet annotations across 123 fine-grained interaction categories and locations, covering a rich diversity of scenarios, object types, and hand configurations in daily activities. In addition, we explore and adapt third-person HOI detection methods to Ego-HOIBench and illustrate the challenges of hand-occluded objects and the complexity of single- and two-hand interactions. To build a new baseline, we propose a Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR) scheme, which leverages hand pose and geometric information as valuable cues for interpreting interactions. Specifically, the HGIR scheme explicitly extracts global hand geometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals and refines the interaction-specific features using pose-interaction attention. This scheme enables the model to obtain a robust and powerful interaction representation, significantly improving the Ego-HOI detection capability. Our approach is lightweight and effective, and it can be easily applied to HOI baselines in a plug-and-play manner to achieve state-of-the-art results on Ego-HOIBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory scalability issues in 3DGS for high-resolution scenarios.

Method: Hierarchical block-level optimization with coarse-to-fine refinement, Gaussian partitioning, and Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: HRGS enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D reconstruction under memory constraints.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in real-time 3D scene reconstruction, but faces memory scalability issues in high-resolution scenarios. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Our method enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction even under memory constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that HRGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: UniSpace-3D introduces a unified representation space for 3D visual grounding, bridging the gap between visual and textual features, outperforming baselines by 2.24%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3DVG rely on separate pre-trained encoders, causing discrepancies in spatial geometry and semantics, leading to errors in object positioning and classification.

Method: UniSpace-3D uses a unified representation encoder (based on CLIP), multi-modal contrastive learning, and a language-guided query selection module to align visual and textual features.

Result: UniSpace-3D outperforms baseline models by at least 2.24% on ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets.

Conclusion: UniSpace-3D effectively bridges the modality gap in 3DVG, improving accuracy and alignment between visual and textual features.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) is a critical task in scene understanding that aims to identify objects in 3D scenes based on text descriptions. However, existing methods rely on separately pre-trained vision and text encoders, resulting in a significant gap between the two modalities in terms of spatial geometry and semantic categories. This discrepancy often causes errors in object positioning and classification. The paper proposes UniSpace-3D, which innovatively introduces a unified representation space for 3DVG, effectively bridging the gap between visual and textual features. Specifically, UniSpace-3D incorporates three innovative designs: i) a unified representation encoder that leverages the pre-trained CLIP model to map visual and textual features into a unified representation space, effectively bridging the gap between the two modalities; ii) a multi-modal contrastive learning module that further reduces the modality gap; iii) a language-guided query selection module that utilizes the positional and semantic information to identify object candidate points aligned with textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSpace-3D outperforms baseline models by at least 2.24% on the ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets. The code will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LiDAR-based place recognition framework using density-agnostic geometric reasoning achieves state-of-the-art performance by fusing macro and micro geometric information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of inconsistent point cloud density and fragile geometric representations in current LiDAR-based place recognition methods.

Method: Proposes an implicit 3D representation with elastic points, derives occupancy grid and normal vector information, and fuses geometric descriptors from bird's-eye view and 3D segments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) with balanced accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization.

Conclusion: The framework offers robust, scalable place recognition and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: LiDAR-based place recognition serves as a crucial enabler for long-term autonomy in robotics and autonomous driving systems. Yet, prevailing methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges: (1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization for historical maps, showcasing excellent Resilient and scalability. Our code will be open-sourced in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'synth-dacl', synthetic dataset extensions to improve class balance and model performance in bridge defect segmentation, achieving notable accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in bridge inspection due to resource constraints and the need for robust automated defect classification.

Method: Creation of synthetic dataset extensions ('synth-dacl') to address class imbalance in the dacl10k dataset.

Result: Improved model robustness, with a 2% increase in mean IoU, F1 score, Recall, and Precision on perturbed test sets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data extensions effectively enhance model performance for fine-grained defect segmentation in bridge inspections.

Abstract: Adequate bridge inspection is increasingly challenging in many countries due to growing ailing stocks, compounded with a lack of staff and financial resources. Automating the key task of visual bridge inspection, classification of defects and building components on pixel level, improves efficiency, increases accuracy and enhances safety in the inspection process and resulting building assessment. Models overtaking this task must cope with an assortment of real-world conditions. They must be robust to variations in image quality, as well as background texture, as defects often appear on surfaces of diverse texture and degree of weathering. dacl10k is the largest and most diverse dataset for real-world concrete bridge inspections. However, the dataset exhibits class imbalance, which leads to notably poor model performance particularly when segmenting fine-grained classes such as cracks and cavities. This work introduces "synth-dacl", a compilation of three novel dataset extensions based on synthetic concrete textures. These extensions are designed to balance class distribution in dacl10k and enhance model performance, especially for crack and cavity segmentation. When incorporating the synth-dacl extensions, we observe substantial improvements in model robustness across 15 perturbed test sets. Notably, on the perturbed test set, a model trained on dacl10k combined with all synthetic extensions achieves a 2% increase in mean IoU, F1 score, Recall, and Precision compared to the same model trained solely on dacl10k.

Motivation: To improve detection of temporarily stationary objects in visual tracking, addressing challenges like occlusion and illumination changes.

Result: The method is robust to partial/full occlusion, illumination changes, and operates in real time.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively detects and tracks stationary objects under varying conditions.

Abstract: In general, background subtraction-based methods are used to detect moving objects in visual tracking applications. In this paper, we employed a background subtraction-based scheme to detect the temporarily stationary objects. We proposed two schemes for stationary object detection, and we compare those in terms of detection performance and computational complexity. In the first approach, we used a single background, and in the second approach, we used dual backgrounds, generated with different learning rates, in order to detect temporarily stopped objects. Finally, we used normalized cross correlation (NCC) based image comparison to monitor and track the detected stationary object in a video scene. The proposed method is robust with partial occlusion, short-time fully occlusion, and illumination changes, and it can operate in real time.

Method: Proposes SSLProfiler with specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing for cell images.

Result: SSLProfiler won the Cell Line Transferability challenge at CVPR 2025.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in cell image profiling, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Image-based cell profiling aims to create informative representations of cell images. This technique is critical in drug discovery and has greatly advanced with recent improvements in computer vision. Inspired by recent developments in non-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial exploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images using such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail; and 2) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively combine all available information. To overcome these challenges, we propose SSLProfiler, a non-contrastive SSL framework specifically designed for cell profiling. We introduce specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which effectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature extractor. With these improvements, SSLProfiler won the Cell Line Transferability challenge at CVPR 2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale labeled 360 video datasets due to spherical distortions and annotation complexity hinders progress in 360 scene understanding tasks.

Method: A three-stage annotation pipeline: Initial Annotation (Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement), Auto-Refine Annotation (correcting missing regions), and Manual Revision (LLM and human validation).

Result: Leader360V improves model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, validated by user studies and evaluations.

Conclusion: Leader360V and its annotation pipeline enable scalable 360 scene understanding, addressing dataset limitations.

Abstract: 360 video captures the complete surrounding scenes with the ultra-large field of view of 360X180. This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations. Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline. Meanwhile, experiments confirm that Leader360V significantly enhances model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, paving the way for more scalable 360 scene understanding.

A correspondence map represented as a functional map, namely a change of basis matrix, can be additionally treated as a 2D image. With this perspective, we train an image diffusion model directly in the space of functional maps, enabling it to generate accurate maps conditioned on an inaccurate initial map. The training is done purely in the functional space, and thus is highly efficient. At inference time, we use the pointwise map corresponding to the current functional map as guidance during the diffusion process. The guidance can additionally encourage different functional map objectives, such as orthogonality and commutativity with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods of map refinement and that guided diffusion models provide a promising pathway to functional map processing.

*Zoubida Ameur,Frédéric Lefebvre,Philippe De Lagrange,Miloš Radosavljević*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGA-NN is a learning-based method for analyzing film grain to preserve it during compression, balancing accuracy and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Film grain is often lost in compression; preserving it maintains artistic intent.

Method: Uses FGA-NN, a learning-based approach, to analyze and model film grain before encoding.

Result: FGA-NN achieves superior accuracy and robustness in film grain analysis.

Conclusion: FGA-NN effectively preserves film grain in compressed content, aligning with artistic goals.

Abstract: Film grain, once a by-product of analog film, is now present in most cinematographic content for aesthetic reasons. However, when such content is compressed at medium to low bitrates, film grain is lost due to its random nature. To preserve artistic intent while compressing efficiently, film grain is analyzed and modeled before encoding and synthesized after decoding. This paper introduces FGA-NN, the first learning-based film grain analysis method to estimate conventional film grain parameters compatible with conventional synthesis. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate FGA-NN's superior balance between analysis accuracy and synthesis complexity, along with its robustness and applicability.

*Xiaoqi Wang,Yi Wang,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVA02-AT introduces efficient video-language models for egocentric tasks, addressing pre-training costs, spatial-temporal encoding, and learning objectives with innovations like joint attention and SMS loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from high pre-training costs, ineffective spatial-temporal encoding, and imprecise learning objectives in egocentric video-language tasks.

Method: EVA02-AT transfers an image-based CLIP model into a video encoder via single-stage pretraining, uses spatial-temporal rotary positional embeddings with joint attention, and introduces the SMS loss for multi-instance retrieval.

Result: EVA02-AT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego with fewer parameters, and SMS loss improves multi-instance retrieval.

Conclusion: EVA02-AT offers a robust, efficient solution for egocentric video-language understanding, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Egocentric video-language understanding demands both high efficiency and accurate spatial-temporal modeling. Existing approaches face three key challenges: 1) Excessive pre-training cost arising from multi-stage pre-training pipelines, 2) Ineffective spatial-temporal encoding due to manually split 3D rotary positional embeddings that hinder feature interactions, and 3) Imprecise learning objectives in soft-label multi-instance retrieval, which neglect negative pair correlations. In this paper, we introduce EVA02-AT, a suite of EVA02-based video-language foundation models tailored to egocentric video understanding tasks. EVA02-AT first efficiently transfers an image-based CLIP model into a unified video encoder via a single-stage pretraining. Second, instead of applying rotary positional embeddings to isolated dimensions, we introduce spatial-temporal rotary positional embeddings along with joint attention, which can effectively encode both spatial and temporal information on the entire hidden dimension. This joint encoding of spatial-temporal features enables the model to learn cross-axis relationships, which are crucial for accurately modeling motion and interaction in videos. Third, focusing on multi-instance video-language retrieval tasks, we introduce the Symmetric Multi-Similarity (SMS) loss and a novel training framework that advances all soft labels for both positive and negative pairs, providing a more precise learning objective. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego under zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate that EVA02-AT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse egocentric video-language tasks with fewer parameters. Models with our SMS loss also show significant performance gains on multi-instance retrieval benchmarks. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/xqwang14/EVA02-AT .

Conclusion: The dataset and model provide a strong benchmark, with Explainable AI insights guiding future work.

Abstract: Forecasting surface water dynamics is crucial for water resource management and climate change adaptation. However, the field lacks comprehensive datasets and standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce HydroChronos, a large-scale, multi-modal spatiotemporal dataset for surface water dynamics forecasting designed to address this gap. We couple the dataset with three forecasting tasks. The dataset includes over three decades of aligned Landsat 5 and Sentinel-2 imagery, climate data, and Digital Elevation Models for diverse lakes and rivers across Europe, North America, and South America. We also propose AquaClimaTempo UNet, a novel spatiotemporal architecture with a dedicated climate data branch, as a strong benchmark baseline. Our model significantly outperforms a Persistence baseline for forecasting future water dynamics by +14% and +11% F1 across change detection and direction of change classification tasks, and by +0.1 MAE on the magnitude of change regression. Finally, we conduct an Explainable AI analysis to identify the key climate variables and input channels that influence surface water change, providing insights to inform and guide future modeling efforts.

To address this challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthSeg introduces depth/height modeling in 2D remote sensing semantic segmentation to address spectral confusion and shadow occlusion, improving land cover classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore elevation differences, leading to misclassification in complex scenarios like shadow occlusion and spectral confusion.

Method: DepthSeg uses a lightweight adapter for fine-tuning, a depth prompter for explicit height modeling, and a semantic decoder for accurate land-cover extraction.

Result: Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset show DepthSeg's effectiveness in land cover mapping, with ablation studies confirming the importance of depth prompts.

Conclusion: DepthSeg enhances semantic segmentation by integrating depth/height information, mitigating spectral confusion and shadow occlusion challenges.

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation is crucial for extracting detailed land surface information, enabling applications such as environmental monitoring, land use planning, and resource assessment. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types. Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg framework in land cover mapping tasks. Detailed ablation studies further highlight the significance of the depth prompts in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

*Huan Kang,Hui Li,Xiao-Jun Wu,Tianyang Xu,Rui Wang,Chunyang Cheng,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GrFormer, a novel attention mechanism using Grassmann manifold for infrared and visible image fusion, addressing limitations of Euclidean methods by capturing semantic similarity and multi-scale fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean methods fail to capture the intrinsic topological structure of non-Euclidean image data, leading to poor fusion performance. Balancing low-level details and high-level semantics is crucial for infrared and visible image fusion.

Method: GrFormer constructs a low-rank subspace mapping on the Grassmann manifold, compressing attention features into subspaces of varying ranks to decouple high-frequency details and low-frequency semantics. A cross-modal fusion strategy (CMS) maximizes complementary properties and suppresses redundant features.

Result: GrFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively on multiple image fusion benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Grassmann manifold-based approach effectively addresses the limitations of Euclidean methods, achieving superior fusion performance by leveraging semantic similarity and multi-scale fusion.

Abstract: In the field of image fusion, promising progress has been made by modeling data from different modalities as linear subspaces.
  However, in practice, the source images are often located in a non-Euclidean space, where the Euclidean methods usually cannot
  encapsulate the intrinsic topological structure. Typically, the inner product performed in the Euclidean space calculates the algebraic
  similarity rather than the semantic similarity, which results in undesired attention output and a decrease in fusion performance.
  While the balance of low-level details and high-level semantics should be considered in infrared and visible image fusion task. To
  address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Grassmann manifold for infrared and visible
  image fusion (GrFormer). Specifically, our method constructs a low-rank subspace mapping through projection constraints on the
  Grassmann manifold, compressing attention features into subspaces of varying rank levels. This forces the features to decouple into
  high-frequency details (local low-rank) and low-frequency semantics (global low-rank), thereby achieving multi-scale semantic
  fusion. Additionally, to effectively integrate the significant information, we develop a cross-modal fusion strategy (CMS) based on
  a covariance mask to maximise the complementary properties between different modalities and to suppress the features with high
  correlation, which are deemed redundant. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms SOTA methods both
  qualitatively and quantitatively on multiple image fusion benchmarks. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shaoyun2023.

*Tian Xia,Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Rajat R Rasal,Avinash Kori,Raghav Mehta,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG) to improve counterfactual image generation by addressing attribute amplification issues in standard CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CFG's global weighting leads to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes (attribute amplification), limiting faithful counterfactual generation.

Method: Proposes DCFG, a model-agnostic framework using group-wise conditioning control and attribute-split embedding to disentangle semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on attribute groups.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED show DCFG improves intervention fidelity, reduces unintended changes, and enhances reversibility.

Conclusion: DCFG enables more faithful and interpretable counterfactual image generation by mitigating attribute amplification.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation aims to simulate realistic visual outcomes under specific causal interventions. Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG). However, standard CFG applies a single global weight across all conditioning variables, which can lead to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes - a phenomenon known as attribute amplification. To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED show that DCFG improves intervention fidelity, mitigates unintended changes, and enhances reversibility, enabling more faithful and interpretable counterfactual image generation.

TL;DR: A framework for causally faithful counterfactual video generation using text-to-image latent diffusion models, guided by a vision-language model, without needing internal access or finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of maintaining causal relationships in video content when editing, to avoid unrealistic or misleading outcomes.

Method: Optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph to guide generation, agnostic to the underlying video editing system.

Result: Demonstrates effective generation of causally faithful video counterfactuals within the learned distribution of LDMs.

Conclusion: The method has potential for realistic "what-if" video scenarios in fields like healthcare and digital media, due to its compatibility with black-box systems.

Abstract: Adapting text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models for video editing has shown strong visual fidelity and controllability, but challenges remain in maintaining causal relationships in video content. Edits affecting causally dependent attributes risk generating unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we propose a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, guided by a vision-language model (VLM). Our method is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or finetuning. Instead, we guide the generation by optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph, addressing the challenge of latent space control in LDMs. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Our results demonstrate that causally faithful video counterfactuals can be effectively generated within the learned distribution of LDMs through prompt-based causal steering. With its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our method holds significant potential for generating realistic "what-if" video scenarios in diverse areas such as healthcare and digital media.

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual attribute imbalance in image classification, proposing a CLIP-based framework to evaluate attributes and a sampling strategy to mitigate imbalance, improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual attribute imbalance in image classification is underexplored and impacts model performance and generalization.

Method: A CLIP-based framework constructs a visual attribute dictionary for automatic evaluation. Sampling probability is adjusted based on attribute rarity, combined with data augmentation techniques like CutMix, Fmix, and SaliencyMix.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively mitigates attribute imbalance, enhancing model robustness and fairness.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes modeling visual attribute distributions and offers a scalable solution for long-tail image classification.

Abstract: Visual attribute imbalance is a common yet underexplored issue in image classification, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. In this work, we first define the first-level and second-level attributes of images and then introduce a CLIP-based framework to construct a visual attribute dictionary, enabling automatic evaluation of image attributes. By systematically analyzing both single-attribute imbalance and compositional attribute imbalance, we reveal how the rarity of attributes affects model performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose adjusting the sampling probability of samples based on the rarity of their compositional attributes. This strategy is further integrated with various data augmentation techniques (such as CutMix, Fmix, and SaliencyMix) to enhance the model's ability to represent rare attributes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates attribute imbalance, thereby improving the robustness and fairness of deep neural networks. Our research highlights the importance of modeling visual attribute distributions and provides a scalable solution for long-tail image classification tasks.

Motivation: The challenge lies in generating realistic and controllable human motions, especially multi-character interactions, due to data scarcity and modeling complexities.

Method: The authors introduce Motion2D-Video-150K dataset and propose RVHM2D, a diffusion-based model with enhanced textual conditioning and a two-stage training strategy (diffusion objective + reinforcement learning).

Result: RVHM2D achieves leading performance on the Motion2D-Video-150K benchmark for single and double-character motion generation.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model effectively address the challenges of generating realistic and controllable human motions, particularly for multi-character interactions.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable human motions, particularly those involving rich multi-character interactions, remains a significant challenge due to data scarcity and the complexities of modeling inter-personal dynamics. To address these limitations, we first introduce a new large-scale rich video human motion 2D dataset (Motion2D-Video-150K) comprising 150,000 video sequences. Motion2D-Video-150K features a balanced distribution of diverse single-character and, crucially, double-character interactive actions, each paired with detailed textual descriptions. Building upon this dataset, we propose a novel diffusion-based rich video human motion2D generation (RVHM2D) model. RVHM2D incorporates an enhanced textual conditioning mechanism utilizing either dual text encoders (CLIP-L/B) or T5-XXL with both global and local features. We devise a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained with a standard diffusion objective, and then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with an FID-based reward to further enhance motion realism and text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RVHM2D achieves leading performance on the Motion2D-Video-150K benchmark in generating both single and interactive double-character scenarios.

TL;DR: MoTE trains ternary experts for memory-efficient Mixture-of-Experts models, matching full-precision performance with lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high memory footprint of full-precision experts in Mixture-of-Experts models, making them more deployable on edge devices.

Method: Train ternary experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1} using pre-trained FFN as a shared expert, enabling scalable and memory-efficient training.

Result: MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision MoE-LLaVA with lower memory usage and outperforms it by 4.3% accuracy under memory constraints.

Conclusion: MoTE is an effective, scalable solution for memory-constrained devices, combining ternary experts and post-training quantization.

Abstract: Large multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) effectively scale the model size to boost performance while maintaining fixed active parameters. However, previous works primarily utilized full-precision experts during sparse up-cycling. Despite they show superior performance on end tasks, the large amount of experts introduces higher memory footprint, which poses significant challenges for the deployment on edge devices. In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower. Given the same amount of expert memory footprint of 3.4GB and combined with post-training quantization, MoTE outperforms MoE-LLaVA by a gain of 4.3% average accuracy on end tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for memory-constrained devices.

Result: Achieves 92.6% accuracy (1.1% improvement) with 4.1x compression, reducing inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Outperforms conventional methods across architectures.

Conclusion: IG-based knowledge distillation is a robust, generalizable compression technique for edge deployment, maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Model compression is critical for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. We introduce a novel method enhancing knowledge distillation with integrated gradients (IG) as a data augmentation strategy. Our approach overlays IG maps onto input images during training, providing student models with deeper insights into teacher models' decision-making processes. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%). This compression reduces inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Our method precomputes IG maps before training, transforming substantial runtime costs into a one-time preprocessing step. Our comprehensive experiments include: (1) comparisons with attention transfer, revealing complementary benefits when combined with our approach; (2) Monte Carlo simulations confirming statistical robustness; (3) systematic evaluation of compression factor versus accuracy trade-offs across a wide range (2.2x-1122x); and (4) validation on an ImageNet subset aligned with CIFAR-10 classes, demonstrating generalisability beyond the initial dataset. These extensive ablation studies confirm that IG-based knowledge distillation consistently outperforms conventional approaches across varied architectures and compression ratios. Our results establish this framework as a viable compression technique for real-world deployment on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: A lightweight 3B parameter vision-language model is fine-tuned for Radiological VQA, achieving robust performance with curated data and a cost-effective training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in Radiological VQA include limited expert-labeled data, complex image patterns, and lack of evaluation efforts.

Method: Fine-tuning a small model using synthetic QA pairs and multi-stage fine-tuning on radiological datasets (ROCO v2.0, MedPix v2.0).

Result: The model performs well despite its small size and limited data, comparable to larger models like LLaVA-Med.

Conclusion: Lightweight models with curated data and saliency-based diagnostics can address radiological VQA challenges effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language systems have improved the accuracy of Radiological Visual Question Answering (VQA) Models. However, some challenges remain across each stage of model development: limited expert-labeled images hinders data procurement at scale; the intricate and nuanced patterns of radiological images make modeling inherently difficult; and the lack of evaluation evaluation efforts makes it difficult to identify cases where the model might be ill-conditioned. In this study, we fine-tune a lightweight 3B parameter vision-language model for Radiological VQA, demonstrating that small models, when appropriately tuned with curated data, can achieve robust performance across both open- and closed-ended questions. We propose a cost-effective training pipeline from synthetic question-answer pair generation to multi-stage fine-tuning on specialised radiological domain-targeted datasets (e.g., ROCO v2.0, MedPix v2.0). Our results show that despite operating at a fraction of the scale of state-of-the-art models such as LLaVA-Med, our model achieves promising performance given its small parameter size and the limited scale of training data. We introduce a lightweight saliency-based diagnostic tool that enables domain experts to inspect VQA model performance and identify ill-conditioned failure modes through saliency analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs rely on limited FOV inputs, but panoramas offer more complete and continuous scene representations, necessitating new methods for dense understanding.

Method: The authors create a dataset with 160K panoramas and annotations, propose ERP-RoPE for position encoding, and introduce Dense360-Bench for evaluation.

Result: The dataset includes 5M captions, 1M referring expressions, and 100K scene descriptions, with ERP-RoPE addressing ERP-specific challenges.

Conclusion: The work advances dense visual-language understanding in panoramic settings, providing tools and benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require comprehensive visual inputs to achieve dense understanding of the physical world. While existing MLLMs demonstrate impressive world understanding capabilities through limited field-of-view (FOV) visual inputs (e.g., 70 degree), we take the first step toward dense understanding from omnidirectional panoramas. We first introduce an omnidirectional panoramas dataset featuring a comprehensive suite of reliability-scored annotations. Specifically, our dataset contains 160K panoramas with 5M dense entity-level captions, 1M unique referring expressions, and 100K entity-grounded panoramic scene descriptions. Compared to multi-view alternatives, panoramas can provide more complete, compact, and continuous scene representations through equirectangular projections (ERP). However, the use of ERP introduces two key challenges for MLLMs: i) spatial continuity along the circle of latitude, and ii) latitude-dependent variation in information density. We address these challenges through ERP-RoPE, a position encoding scheme specifically designed for panoramic ERP. In addition, we introduce Dense360-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on omnidirectional captioning and grounding, establishing a comprehensive framework for advancing dense visual-language understanding in panoramic settings.

TL;DR: FM-based subset selection outperforms traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets but not on coarse-grained ones. RAM-APL, a new method leveraging multiple FMs, achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce deep learning training costs by improving subset selection methods, especially for fine-grained datasets, using foundation models (FMs) instead of traditional information extractors (IEs).

Method: Proposes RAM-APL, a method that uses multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths, specifically designed for fine-grained image datasets.

Result: FMs outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets but not on coarse-grained ones. RAM-APL achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

Conclusion: FM-based subset selection is superior for fine-grained datasets, and RAM-APL effectively leverages multiple FMs to achieve top performance in this context.

Abstract: One-shot subset selection serves as an effective tool to reduce deep learning training costs by identifying an informative data subset based on the information extracted by an information extractor (IE). Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

*Yu Qi,Lipeng Gu,Honghua Chen,Liangliang Nan,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpeechRefer enhances 3D visual grounding by addressing noisy speech-to-text transcriptions, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DVG methods rely on precise text prompts, but real-world speech inputs often contain errors due to accents, noise, and speech variations.

Method: SpeechRefer introduces a Speech Complementary Module to capture acoustic similarities and a Contrastive Complementary Module for aligning erroneous text with speech features.

Result: Experiments show SpeechRefer significantly boosts performance of existing 3DVG methods on noisy speech inputs.

Conclusion: SpeechRefer bridges the gap between noisy speech and reliable 3DVG, enabling more intuitive multimodal systems.

Abstract: Existing 3D visual grounding methods rely on precise text prompts to locate objects within 3D scenes. Speech, as a natural and intuitive modality, offers a promising alternative. Real-world speech inputs, however, often suffer from transcription errors due to accents, background noise, and varying speech rates, limiting the applicability of existing 3DVG methods. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SpeechRefer}, a novel 3DVG framework designed to enhance performance in the presence of noisy and ambiguous speech-to-text transcriptions. SpeechRefer integrates seamlessly with xisting 3DVG models and introduces two key innovations. First, the Speech Complementary Module captures acoustic similarities between phonetically related words and highlights subtle distinctions, generating complementary proposal scores from the speech signal. This reduces dependence on potentially erroneous transcriptions. Second, the Contrastive Complementary Module employs contrastive learning to align erroneous text features with corresponding speech features, ensuring robust performance even when transcription errors dominate. Extensive experiments on the SpeechRefer and peechNr3D datasets demonstrate that SpeechRefer improves the performance of existing 3DVG methods by a large margin, which highlights SpeechRefer's potential to bridge the gap between noisy speech inputs and reliable 3DVG, enabling more intuitive and practical multimodal systems.

*Zhiwen Shao,Yifan Cheng,Feiran Li,Yong Zhou,Xuequan Lu,Yuan Xie,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework for facial micro-expression recognition (MER), combining transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution. Introduces F5C block for local-global feature extraction without key frames and jointly trains MER with optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods rely on hand-crafted features or key frames and are limited by small, low-diversity datasets. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging deep learning and multi-task learning.

Method: Uses a novel F5C block (fully-connected and channel correspondence convolution) for local-global feature extraction. Jointly trains MER with optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection to enhance subtle action capture.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods on benchmarks (CASME II, SAMM, SMIC). Also effective for optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection, capturing subtle facial muscle actions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses MER challenges by integrating multi-task learning and advanced convolution techniques, achieving superior performance and capturing subtle facial actions.

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging problem, due to transient and subtle micro-expression (ME) actions. Most existing methods depend on hand-crafted features, key frames like onset, apex, and offset frames, or deep networks limited by small-scale and low-diversity datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework with advantages from transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution. In particular, we propose a novel F5C block composed of fully-connected convolution and channel correspondence convolution to directly extract local-global features from a sequence of raw frames, without the prior knowledge of key frames. The transformer-style fully-connected convolution is proposed to extract local features while maintaining global receptive fields, and the graph-style channel correspondence convolution is introduced to model the correlations among feature patterns. Moreover, MER, optical flow estimation, and facial landmark detection are jointly trained by sharing the local-global features. The two latter tasks contribute to capturing facial subtle action information for MER, which can alleviate the impact of insufficient training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on CASME II, SAMM, and SMIC benchmarks, (ii) works well for optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection, and (iii) can capture facial subtle muscle actions in local regions associated with MEs.

### [180] [SIRI-Bench: Challenging VLMs' Spatial Intelligence through Complex Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14512)
*Zijian Song,Xiaoxin Lin,Qiuming Huang,Guangrun Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIRI-Bench is introduced to evaluate VLMs' spatial intelligence through video-based reasoning tasks, revealing their struggles in spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence is crucial for VLMs but lacks systematic evaluation in complex reasoning contexts.

Method: Developed SIRI-Bench with 1K video-question-answer triplets in realistic 3D scenes and an Automatic Scene Creation Engine for data synthesis.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on SIRI-Bench, highlighting the challenge of spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The study aims to draw attention to spatially grounded reasoning and improve VLMs' visual problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are experiencing rapid advancements in complex reasoning, exhibiting remarkable generalization in mathematics and programming. In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic evaluation of their complex reasoning ability within spatial contexts remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' spatial intelligence through video-based reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises nearly 1K video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene and captured by video. By carefully designing questions and corresponding 3D scenes, our benchmark ensures that solving the questions requires both spatial comprehension for extracting information and high-level reasoning for deriving solutions, making it a challenging benchmark for evaluating VLMs. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine. This engine, leveraging multiple specialized LLM agents, can generate realistic 3D scenes from abstract math problems, ensuring faithfulness to the original descriptions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.

Result: Enhances safe zone accuracy through joint optimization, retains zero-shot generalization, and shows superior cross-domain robustness.

Conclusion: VisLanding provides reliable landing zone estimation and decision-making support, outperforming other methods in generalization and robustness.

Abstract: This paper presents VisLanding, a monocular 3D perception-based framework for safe UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) landing. Addressing the core challenge of autonomous UAV landing in complex and unknown environments, this study innovatively leverages the depth-normal synergy prediction capabilities of the Metric3D V2 model to construct an end-to-end safe landing zones (SLZ) estimation framework. By introducing a safe zone segmentation branch, we transform the landing zone estimation task into a binary semantic segmentation problem. The model is fine-tuned and annotated using the WildUAV dataset from a UAV perspective, while a cross-domain evaluation dataset is constructed to validate the model's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that VisLanding significantly enhances the accuracy of safe zone identification through a depth-normal joint optimization mechanism, while retaining the zero-shot generalization advantages of Metric3D V2. The proposed method exhibits superior generalization and robustness in cross-domain testing compared to other approaches. Furthermore, it enables the estimation of landing zone area by integrating predicted depth and normal information, providing critical decision-making support for practical applications.

Abstract: Image restoration faces challenges including ineffective feature fusion, computational bottlenecks and inefficient diffusion processes. To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics. Our method establishes a new paradigm for adaptive, high-efficiency image restoration with optimized hardware utilization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamLight is a universal image relighting model that composites subjects into new backgrounds with aesthetic uniformity, supporting both image-based and text-based relighting. It uses semantic priors and novel modules like PGLA and SFF for realistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on image-based relighting or struggle with realistic light interactions. DreamLight addresses these gaps by leveraging pretrained diffusion models and introducing new modules for better performance.

Method: DreamLight reorganizes input data into a unified format, uses semantic priors from a pretrained diffusion model, and introduces PGLA for light information condensation and SFF for frequency component reorganization.

Result: Extensive comparisons and user studies show DreamLight achieves remarkable relighting performance, generating realistic and natural light interactions.

Conclusion: DreamLight advances universal image relighting by addressing limitations of existing methods and introducing innovative modules for improved results.

Abstract: We introduce a model named DreamLight for universal image relighting in this work, which can seamlessly composite subjects into a new background while maintaining aesthetic uniformity in terms of lighting and color tone. The background can be specified by natural images (image-based relighting) or generated from unlimited text prompts (text-based relighting). Existing studies primarily focus on image-based relighting, while with scant exploration into text-based scenarios. Some works employ intricate disentanglement pipeline designs relying on environment maps to provide relevant information, which grapples with the expensive data cost required for intrinsic decomposition and light source. Other methods take this task as an image translation problem and perform pixel-level transformation with autoencoder architecture. While these methods have achieved decent harmonization effects, they struggle to generate realistic and natural light interaction effects between the foreground and background. To alleviate these challenges, we reorganize the input data into a unified format and leverage the semantic prior provided by the pretrained diffusion model to facilitate the generation of natural results. Moreover, we propose a Position-Guided Light Adapter (PGLA) that condenses light information from different directions in the background into designed light query embeddings, and modulates the foreground with direction-biased masked attention. In addition, we present a post-processing module named Spectral Foreground Fixer (SFF) to adaptively reorganize different frequency components of subject and relighted background, which helps enhance the consistency of foreground appearance. Extensive comparisons and user study demonstrate that our DreamLight achieves remarkable relighting performance.

*David Butler,Adrian Hilton,Gustavo Carneiro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new interpretable ML method improves knee OA risk estimation by 2% AUC and speeds up inference by 9%, using multi-task predictive modeling and diffusion models for future image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of ML for knee OA risk estimation is limited due to lack of interpretability and impracticality of existing methods.

Method: Uses multi-task predictive modeling (classifying OA severity and predicting knee landmarks) with a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to generate future images.

Result: Achieves 0.71 AUC (2% improvement over SOTA) and ~9% faster inference on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset.

Conclusion: The method enhances interpretability and efficiency in knee OA risk estimation, addressing gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a crucial role in assessing knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk by enabling early detection and disease monitoring. Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve. Applied to the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, our approach improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2\%, achieving an AUC of 0.71 in predicting knee OA progression while offering ~9% faster inference time.

We introduce an automated LaTeX-based pipeline that synthesizes realistic two-column pages with visually diverse table layouts and aligned ground-truth masks. The generated corpus augments the real-world Marmot benchmark and enables a systematic resolution study of TableNet. Training TableNet on our synthetic data achieves a pixel-wise XOR error of 4.04% on our synthetic test set with a 256x256 input resolution, and 4.33% with 1024x1024. The best performance on the Marmot benchmark is 9.18% (at 256x256), while cutting manual annotation effort through automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook directional and angular correlations in skeletons, leading to implausible poses under occlusions or motion changes.

Method: Uses a dual graph convolutional structure for joint and bone graphs, a Cross-Attention module, dynamic fusion, and an improved Transformer encoder.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and generalizes well on in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: PoseGRAF effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating joint and bone features, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Existing monocular 3D pose estimation methods primarily rely on joint positional features, while overlooking intrinsic directional and angular correlations within the skeleton. As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches. Additional evaluations on in-the-wild videos further validate its generalizability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/iCityLab/PoseGRAF.

TL;DR: Flow maps generalize diffusion and flow-based models, enabling efficient generation across step counts. Align Your Flow introduces new objectives and techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-step image and text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models like diffusion and flow-based methods require many sampling steps, while consistency models degrade with more steps. Flow maps aim to bridge this gap by generalizing these approaches and improving efficiency.

Method: Introduces continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, autoguidance for distillation, and adversarial finetuning. Validated on image generation benchmarks (ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512) and text-to-image synthesis.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on ImageNet and outperforms non-adversarial text-to-image samplers.

Conclusion: Flow maps, with novel training techniques, offer efficient and high-quality generation, advancing the field of few-step generative modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches, but they require many sampling steps. Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks. Finally, we show text-to-image flow map models that outperform all existing non-adversarially trained few-step samplers in text-conditioned synthesis.

TL;DR: A method for image restoration using unpaired datasets, outperforming traditional approaches by leveraging conditional flow matching and minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing real-world scenarios where forward models are unknown or paired data is scarce, making traditional methods impractical.

Method: Uses conditional flow matching to model degraded observations and learns the forward model via a distribution-matching loss.

Result: Outperforms single-image blind and unsupervised methods on deblurring and PSF calibration, matches state-of-the-art in blind super-resolution.

Conclusion: The method is effective for real-world applications like lens calibration, requiring minimal data and effort compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: This work addresses image restoration tasks through the lens of inverse problems using unpaired datasets. In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of a comprehensive framework to assess perceptual impact of compression in 3DGS, despite its real-time rendering benefits.

Method: Created a dataset with controlled subjective experiments (60 viewers) and analyzed scene diversity, MOS distribution, and benchmarked 30 IQA metrics.

Result: Validated dataset quality, established benchmarks, and provided insights into view-dependent quality patterns in 3DGS.

Conclusion: The dataset supports development of specialized IQA metrics for 3DGS and is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for novel view synthesis, offering real-time rendering with high visual fidelity. However, its substantial storage requirements present significant challenges for practical applications. While recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods increasingly incorporate dedicated compression modules, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework to evaluate their perceptual impact. Therefore we present 3DGS-IEval-15K, the first large-scale image quality assessment (IQA) dataset specifically designed for compressed 3DGS representations. Our dataset encompasses 15,200 images rendered from 10 real-world scenes through 6 representative 3DGS algorithms at 20 strategically selected viewpoints, with different compression levels leading to various distortion effects. Through controlled subjective experiments, we collect human perception data from 60 viewers. We validate dataset quality through scene diversity and MOS distribution analysis, and establish a comprehensive benchmark with 30 representative IQA metrics covering diverse types. As the largest-scale 3DGS quality assessment dataset to date, our work provides a foundation for developing 3DGS specialized IQA metrics, and offers essential data for investigating view-dependent quality distribution patterns unique to 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability challenges in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by improving training efficiency.

Method: Uses an autoencoder for image similarity embedding, constructs a kd-tree for efficient dissimilarity ordering, and dynamically updates subsample datasets via curriculum learning.

Result: Achieves up to 27x speedup in gradient-based NAS without performance degradation.

Conclusion: DDS-NAS reduces training time and iterations by maximizing each image sample's contribution.

Abstract: In order to address the scalability challenge within Neural Architecture Search (NAS), we speed up NAS training via dynamic hard example mining within a curriculum learning framework. By utilizing an autoencoder that enforces an image similarity embedding in latent space, we construct an efficient kd-tree structure to order images by furthest neighbour dissimilarity in a low-dimensional embedding. From a given query image from our subsample dataset, we can identify the most dissimilar image within the global dataset in logarithmic time. Via curriculum learning, we then dynamically re-formulate an unbiased subsample dataset for NAS optimisation, upon which the current NAS solution architecture performs poorly. We show that our DDS-NAS framework speeds up gradient-based NAS strategies by up to 27x without loss in performance. By maximising the contribution of each image sample during training, we reduce the duration of a NAS training cycle and the number of iterations required for convergence.

*Ling Li,Yao Zhou,Yuxuan Liang,Fugee Tsung,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLOBE, a novel pipeline for geo-localization using reasoning-driven tasks, addressing data diversity and model reasoning limitations with a new dataset (MP16-Reason) and optimized VLM enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geo-localization methods lack interpretability and rely on limited datasets (e.g., street-view imagery) and supervised fine-tuning, which hampers reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes GLOBE, combining a reasoning-oriented dataset (MP16-Reason) with group-relative policy optimization to enhance locatability assessment, visual clue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy.

Result: GLOBE outperforms state-of-the-art LVLMs in geo-localization, especially in diverse scenes, and produces more interpretable reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach advances geo-localization by integrating reasoning-driven tasks and diverse data, improving accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Previous methods for image geo-localization have typically treated the task as either classification or retrieval, often relying on black-box decisions that lack interpretability. The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images. We introduce GLOBE, Group-relative policy optimization for Locatability assessment and Optimized visual-clue reasoning, yielding Bi-objective geo-Enhancement for the VLM in recognition and reasoning. GLOBE incorporates task-specific rewards that jointly enhance locatability assessment, visual clue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that GLOBE outperforms state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on geo-localization tasks, particularly in diverse visual scenes, while also generating more insightful and interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocalClick-XL extends FocalClick's coarse-to-fine design, introducing a multi-stage pipeline with dedicated subnets for context, object, and detail levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive segmentation methods lack flexibility and struggle with fine details, prompting the need for a more versatile and effective approach.

Method: Proposes FocalClick-XL, decomposing interactive segmentation into meta-tasks (context, object, detail) with dedicated subnets, scaled pretraining, and a prompting layer for interaction types.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on click-based benchmarks and adapts well to diverse interaction forms (boxes, scribbles, masks), also predicting alpha mattes.

Conclusion: FocalClick-XL is a versatile, powerful tool for interactive segmentation, excelling in performance and adaptability while handling fine details.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation enables users to extract binary masks of target objects through simple interactions such as clicks, scribbles, and boxes. However, existing methods often support only limited interaction forms and struggle to capture fine details. In this paper, we revisit the classical coarse-to-fine design of FocalClick and introduce significant extensions. Inspired by its multi-stage strategy, we propose a novel pipeline, FocalClick-XL, to address these challenges simultaneously. Following the emerging trend of large-scale pretraining, we decompose interactive segmentation into meta-tasks that capture different levels of information -- context, object, and detail -- assigning a dedicated subnet to each level.This decomposition allows each subnet to undergo scaled pretraining with independent data and supervision, maximizing its effectiveness. To enhance flexibility, we share context- and detail-level information across different interaction forms as common knowledge while introducing a prompting layer at the object level to encode specific interaction types. As a result, FocalClick-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance on click-based benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to diverse interaction formats, including boxes, scribbles, and coarse masks. Beyond binary mask generation, it is also capable of predicting alpha mattes with fine-grained details, making it a versatile and powerful tool for interactive segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11-RGBT is a new multimodal object detection framework addressing challenges in multispectral fusion, featuring six fusion modes and strategies like P3 mid-fusion and MCF, improving performance on datasets like LLVIP and FLIR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a unified single-stage framework, struggle with performance-fusion balance, and have poor modality weight allocation, limiting multispectral object detection.

Method: Based on YOLOv11, the framework introduces six fusion modes, a P3 mid-fusion strategy, and MCF for optimizing feature fusion and reducing redundancy.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements, with MCF boosting YOLOv11 models' mAP by 3.41%-5.65% on the FLIR dataset, reaching 47.61%.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-RGBT effectively addresses multispectral fusion challenges, enhancing adaptability and robustness, as validated by superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection, which integrates information from multiple bands, can enhance detection accuracy and environmental adaptability, holding great application potential across various fields. Although existing methods have made progress in cross-modal interaction, low-light conditions, and model lightweight, there are still challenges like the lack of a unified single-stage framework, difficulty in balancing performance and fusion strategy, and unreasonable modality weight allocation. To address these, based on the YOLOv11 framework, we present YOLOv11-RGBT, a new comprehensive multimodal object detection framework. We designed six multispectral fusion modes and successfully applied them to models from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12 and RT-DETR. After reevaluating the importance of the two modalities, we proposed a P3 mid-fusion strategy and multispectral controllable fine-tuning (MCF) strategy for multispectral models. These improvements optimize feature fusion, reduce redundancy and mismatches, and boost overall model performance. Experiments show our framework excels on three major open-source multispectral object detection datasets, like LLVIP and FLIR. Particularly, the multispectral controllable fine-tuning strategy significantly enhanced model adaptability and robustness. On the FLIR dataset, it consistently improved YOLOv11 models' mAP by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching a maximum of 47.61%, verifying the framework and strategies' effectiveness.

*Ni Ou,Zhuo Chen,Xinru Zhang,Junzheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A versatile iterative framework using surrogate diffusion improves extrinsic calibration accuracy for camera-LiDAR fusion in autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end calibration methods lack iterative optimization, limiting accuracy despite the need for higher precision in autonomous vehicle sensor fusion.

Method: Proposes an iterative refinement framework where initial extrinsic parameters are refined through a denoising process, using the original calibration method as a surrogate denoiser.

Result: The framework enhances accuracy, robustness, and stability across four state-of-the-art calibration methods, outperforming single-step and other iterative approaches.

Conclusion: The surrogate diffusion-based framework effectively improves calibration performance without requiring architectural changes, addressing the demand for higher accuracy in sensor fusion.

Abstract: Cameras and LiDAR are essential sensors for autonomous vehicles. The fusion of camera and LiDAR data addresses the limitations of individual sensors but relies on precise extrinsic calibration. Recently, numerous end-to-end calibration methods have been proposed; however, most predict extrinsic parameters in a single step and lack iterative optimization capabilities. To address the increasing demand for higher accuracy, we propose a versatile iterative framework based on surrogate diffusion. This framework can enhance the performance of any calibration method without requiring architectural modifications. Specifically, the initial extrinsic parameters undergo iterative refinement through a denoising process, in which the original calibration method serves as a surrogate denoiser to estimate the final extrinsics at each step. For comparative analysis, we selected four state-of-the-art calibration methods as surrogate denoisers and compared the results of our diffusion process with those of two other iterative approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when integrated with our diffusion model, all calibration methods achieve higher accuracy, improved robustness, and greater stability compared to other iterative techniques and their single-step counterparts.

*Kunal Swami,Debtanu Gupta,Amrit Kumar Muduli,Chirag Jaiswal,Pankaj Kumar Bajpai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiFuse-Net is a novel network for depth estimation using RGB and dual-pixel (DP) data, featuring a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism and cross-modal transfer learning, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation is vital for applications like autonomous navigation, but traditional methods have cost and robustness limitations. DP technology in modern cameras offers an alternative.

Method: DiFuse-Net uses a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism (WBiPAM) for DP disparity cues and a separate RGB encoder. Cross-modal transfer learning (CmTL) leverages RGB-D datasets.

Result: DiFuse-Net outperforms DP and stereo-based baselines. A new high-quality RGB-DP-D dataset (DCDP) is introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset advance depth estimation, particularly for smartphone cameras, by leveraging DP technology and cross-modal learning.

Abstract: Depth estimation is crucial for intelligent systems, enabling applications from autonomous navigation to augmented reality. While traditional stereo and active depth sensors have limitations in cost, power, and robustness, dual-pixel (DP) technology, ubiquitous in modern cameras, offers a compelling alternative. This paper introduces DiFuse-Net, a novel modality decoupled network design for disentangled RGB and DP based depth estimation. DiFuse-Net features a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism (WBiPAM) specifically designed to capture the subtle DP disparity cues unique to smartphone cameras with small aperture. A separate encoder extracts contextual information from the RGB image, and these features are fused to enhance depth prediction. We also propose a Cross-modal Transfer Learning (CmTL) mechanism to utilize large-scale RGB-D datasets in the literature to cope with the limitations of obtaining large-scale RGB-DP-D dataset. Our evaluation and comparison of the proposed method demonstrates its superiority over the DP and stereo-based baseline methods. Additionally, we contribute a new, high-quality, real-world RGB-DP-D training dataset, named Dual-Camera Dual-Pixel (DCDP) dataset, created using our novel symmetric stereo camera hardware setup, stereo calibration and rectification protocol, and AI stereo disparity estimation method.

*Corey Scher,Jamon Van Den Hoek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a long temporal-arc coherent change detection (LT-CCD) method using SAR data to monitor urban damage in Gaza during the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, achieving high accuracy and low false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide timely and accurate damage monitoring in active conflict zones like Gaza, where traditional methods are limited.

Method: Uses interferometric SAR data from Sentinel-1 and LT-CCD to track weekly damage trends.

Result: Detects 92.5% of damage labels with 1.2% false positives, revealing damage patterns and shifts during the war.

Conclusion: The LT-CCD approach is effective for low-cost, rapid damage assessment in humanitarian and journalistic contexts.

Abstract: Aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip beginning October 7, 2023 is one of the most intense bombing campaigns of the twenty-first century, driving widespread urban damage. Characterizing damage over a geographically dynamic and protracted armed conflict requires active monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has precedence for mapping disaster-induced damage with bi-temporal methods but applications to active monitoring during sustained crises are limited. Using interferometric SAR data from Sentinel-1, we apply a long temporal-arc coherent change detection (LT-CCD) approach to track weekly damage trends over the first year of the 2023- Israel-Hamas War. We detect 92.5% of damage labels in reference data from the United Nations with a negligible (1.2%) false positive rate. The temporal fidelity of our approach reveals rapidly increasing damage during the first three months of the war focused in northern Gaza, a notable pause in damage during a temporary ceasefire, and surges of new damage as conflict hot-spots shift from north to south. Three-fifths (191,263) of all buildings are damaged or destroyed by the end of the study. With massive need for timely data on damage in armed conflict zones, our low-cost and low-latency approach enables rapid uptake of damage information at humanitarian and journalistic organizations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncTalk++ improves synchronization in speech-driven talking head videos using dynamic rendering, facial alignment, and head stabilization, achieving high realism and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of synchronizing identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses in talking head videos leads to unrealistic results. SyncTalk++ addresses this 'devil' of synchronization.

Method: SyncTalk++ uses a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting, a Face-Sync Controller for lip alignment, a 3D facial blendshape model, and a Head-Sync Stabilizer. It also includes an Expression Generator and Torso Restorer for robustness.

Result: The method achieves up to 101 FPS, outperforms state-of-the-art in synchronization and realism, and handles out-of-distribution audio effectively.

Conclusion: SyncTalk++ significantly enhances synchronization and realism in talking head videos, validated by experiments and user studies.

Abstract: Achieving high synchronization in the synthesis of realistic, speech-driven talking head videos presents a significant challenge. A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synchronization and realism.

*Qinchan,Li,Kenneth Chen,Changyue,Su,Wittawat Jitkrittum,Qi Sun,Patsorn Sangkloy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework optimizes computational cost and quality in diffusion models by routing prompts to appropriate text-to-image functions based on complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive; this work aims to balance quality and cost by varying computation per prompt.

Method: Automatically routes prompts to the most suitable text-to-image function (e.g., varying denoising steps or different models) based on complexity.

Result: Achieves higher average quality than any single model by routing to nine trained models, tested on COCO and DiffusionDB.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently balances computational cost and quality, outperforming uniform cost reduction techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.

TL;DR: The paper scales up the PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net foundation model using large unlabeled datasets (MajorTOM 23TB and FastTOM 2TB) and evaluates its performance on downstream tasks like road density estimation, building density regression, and land cover segmentation. Results show improved performance with larger datasets and models, and a shift from CNN to ViT architectures is explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the massive volumes of Earth Observation (EO) data, the study aims to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets for efficient fine-tuning with minimal labeled data.

Method: The authors scale up the PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net model on the MajorTOM 23TB and FastTOM 2TB datasets, develop variants with different parameters and architectures, and fine-tune them on the PhilEO Bench for specific tasks.

Result: The PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms others in road density regression, while PhilEO 200M FastTOM excels in road density estimation and building density regression. Dataset and model scaling are validated as effective.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the benefits of scaling datasets and models for EO tasks and explores the transition from CNN to ViT architectures, showing improved performance with larger datasets and models.

Abstract: Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data, with the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation alone producing approximately 1.6TB per day. To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).

*Yujun Wang,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Soeren Pirk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly intervening in attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations due to over-reliance on partial cues, and existing methods like VCD and ICD may not fully address the root cause.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that directly intervenes in the model's attention dynamics, contrasting predictions from perturbed inputs to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: Experiments show significant reduction in hallucinations and improved performance on benchmarks like POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, as well as standard VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-steerable framework offers a principled approach to reducing hallucinations in MLLMs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) often suffer from hallucinations. They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations. Our experiments across multiple MLLM architectures and diverse decoding methods demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the performance on benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, while simultaneously enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks.

*Jiahua Ma,Yiran Qin,Yixiong Li,Xuanqi Liao,Yulan Guo,Ruimao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDP improves robotic action prediction by using historical action sequences and a caching mechanism, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness under imperfect conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware limitations and real-time constraints degrade learning from expert demonstrations, causing failures in tasks like object localization and grasp planning.

Method: CDP is a transformer-based diffusion model that conditions on historical action sequences and uses a caching mechanism to reduce redundant computations.

Result: CDP achieves higher accuracy in 2D and 3D manipulation tasks and maintains precision with degraded input quality.

Conclusion: CDP is a robust solution for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions by leveraging temporal continuity.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of efficient methods to produce high-precision climate change instruction data, which limits LLM development for climate science.

Method: Automated construction of instruction data using document facts, web scraping, and seed instructions, followed by fine-tuning open-source LLMs.

Result: ClimateChat outperforms on climate change Q&A tasks, with insights on base model and instruction data impact.

Conclusion: The study offers practical guidance for building climate-specific LLMs, highlighting the importance of base model selection.

Abstract: As the issue of global climate change becomes increasingly severe, the demand for research in climate science continues to grow. Natural language processing technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate base model for instruction tuning. This research provides valuable references and empirical support for constructing climate change instruction data and training climate change-specific LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with cross-linguistic numeral systems due to inability to infer implicit compositional rules, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail at linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving diverse numeral systems, despite human success.

Method: Conducted experiments to separate linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers, testing LLMs with explicit vs. implicit numeral structures.

Result: LLMs only solve problems when mathematical operations are explicitly marked; they lack human-like inference of implicit numeral structure.

Conclusion: Current LLMs cannot flexibly infer compositional rules from implicit patterns, highlighting a key challenge in reasoning models.

Abstract: Across languages, numeral systems vary widely in how they construct and combine numbers. While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity, large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solve successfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through a series of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc, as in "twenty + three"). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure. We conclude that the ability to flexibly infer compositional rules from implicit patterns in human-scale data remains an open challenge for current reasoning models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative training framework to address challenges in Vision-Language Reward Models (VL-RMs), improving alignment and reasoning in VL models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VL-RMs face bootstrapping dilemmas and modality bias, leading to flawed training data and reinforcement of biases.

Method: The framework uses vision experts, Chain-of-Thought rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling to refine preference datasets and enhance critiques.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in hallucination detection and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach advances VL model alignment with reinforcement learning by addressing key challenges in VL-RM training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with verifiable rewards has advanced large language models but remains underexplored for Vision-Language (VL) models. The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training. To address these issues, we propose an iterative training framework leveraging vision experts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling. Our approach refines preference datasets, enhances structured critiques, and iteratively improves reasoning. Experiments across VL-RM benchmarks demonstrate superior performance in hallucination detection and multimodal reasoning, advancing VL model alignment with reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: A task-oriented spoken dialogue system (SDS) is developed to regulate emotional speech in news conversations, outperforming baselines in emotion regulation and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in task-oriented emotional SDS research due to compartmentalized studies and lack of standardized metrics.

Method: Uses an LLM-based sentiment analyzer and PromptTTS for emotional speech synthesis, with a proposed subjective evaluation scale.

Result: The emotional SDS outperformed baselines in emotion regulation and engagement.

Conclusion: Speech emotion plays a critical role in engaging conversations; source code is open-sourced.

Abstract: We develop a task-oriented spoken dialogue system (SDS) that regulates emotional speech based on contextual cues to enable more empathetic news conversations. Despite advancements in emotional text-to-speech (TTS) techniques, task-oriented emotional SDSs remain underexplored due to the compartmentalized nature of SDS and emotional TTS research, as well as the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for social goals. We address these challenges by developing an emotional SDS for news conversations that utilizes a large language model (LLM)-based sentiment analyzer to identify appropriate emotions and PromptTTS to synthesize context-appropriate emotional speech. We also propose subjective evaluation scale for emotional SDSs and judge the emotion regulation performance of the proposed and baseline systems. Experiments showed that our emotional SDS outperformed a baseline system in terms of the emotion regulation and engagement. These results suggest the critical role of speech emotion for more engaging conversations.

### [207] [Alignment Quality Index (AQI) : Beyond Refusals: AQI as an Intrinsic Alignment Diagnostic via Latent Geometry, Cluster Divergence, and Layer wise Pooled Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13901)
*Abhilekh Borah,Chhavi Sharma,Danush Khanna,Utkarsh Bhatt,Gurpreet Singh,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Raghav Kaushik Ravi,Vinija Jain,Jyoti Patel,Shubham Singh,Vasu Sharma,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Alignment Quality Index (AQI) to assess LLM alignment by analyzing latent space separation of safe/unsafe activations, addressing blind spots in current evaluations. It also proposes the LITMUS dataset for robust testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations rely on flawed proxies (e.g., refusal rates, toxicity classifiers) with blind spots, leaving models vulnerable to jailbreaking and misalignment.

Method: AQI combines geometric metrics (DBS, DI, XBI, CHI) to analyze clustering quality in latent space, detecting hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks. The LITMUS dataset supports empirical validation.

Result: AQI correlates with external judges and reveals vulnerabilities missed by traditional metrics, demonstrating effectiveness across models trained with DPO, GRPO, and RLHF.

Conclusion: AQI provides a robust, decoding-invariant tool for LLM safety auditing, offering early detection of alignment issues and fostering future research.

Abstract: Alignment is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. As large language models (LLMs) enter high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, governance, and law, their behavior must reliably reflect human-aligned values and safety constraints. Yet current evaluations rely heavily on behavioral proxies such as refusal rates, G-Eval scores, and toxicity classifiers, all of which have critical blind spots. Aligned models are often vulnerable to jailbreaking, stochasticity of generation, and alignment faking.
  To address this issue, we introduce the Alignment Quality Index (AQI). This novel geometric and prompt-invariant metric empirically assesses LLM alignment by analyzing the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space. By combining measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS), Dunn Index (DI), Xie-Beni Index (XBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) across various formulations, AQI captures clustering quality to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant. AQI also serves as an early warning signal for alignment faking, offering a robust, decoding invariant tool for behavior agnostic safety auditing.
  Additionally, we propose the LITMUS dataset to facilitate robust evaluation under these challenging conditions. Empirical tests on LITMUS across different models trained under DPO, GRPO, and RLHF conditions demonstrate AQI's correlation with external judges and ability to reveal vulnerabilities missed by refusal metrics. We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this area.

*Shang-Chi Tsai,Seiya Kawano,Angel Garcia Contreras,Koichiro Yoshino,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for data augmentation in robotic assistance uses large language and stable diffusion models to enhance multimodal classification, improving robot action selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of gathering large-scale multimodal datasets for robotic intent understanding by augmenting data with simulated dialogues and environmental imagery.

Method: Leveraging a large language model for dialogue simulation and a stable diffusion model for environmental imagery generation to augment training data.

Result: Significantly improved robot action selection capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances multimodal models for robotic assistance, overcoming data scarcity issues.

Abstract: When designing robots to assist in everyday human activities, it is crucial to enhance user requests with visual cues from their surroundings for improved intent understanding. This process is defined as a multimodal classification task. However, gathering a large-scale dataset encompassing both visual and linguistic elements for model training is challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel framework focusing on data augmentation in robotic assistance scenarios, encompassing both dialogues and related environmental imagery. This approach involves leveraging a sophisticated large language model to simulate potential conversations and environmental contexts, followed by the use of a stable diffusion model to create images depicting these environments. The additionally generated data serves to refine the latest multimodal models, enabling them to more accurately determine appropriate actions in response to user interactions with the limited target data. Our experimental results, based on a dataset collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the robot's action selection capabilities, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

### [209] [Are manual annotations necessary for statutory interpretations retrieval?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13965)
*Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl,Tomer Libal,Adam Kaczmarczyk,Magdalena Król*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores automating the retrieval of legal concept interpretations by analyzing the need for manual annotation, optimal annotation volume, and the impact of using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the costly and repetitive manual annotation process in legal research for retrieving relevant interpretations of legal concepts.

Method: Conducted experiments to determine optimal annotation volume, annotation candidate selection (random vs. best candidates), and automation using LLMs.

Result: Findings suggest potential for reducing manual annotation by optimizing volume and candidate selection, and leveraging LLMs for automation.

Conclusion: Automation and strategic annotation can improve efficiency in retrieving legal interpretations, reducing reliance on manual processes.

Abstract: One of the elements of legal research is looking for cases where judges have extended the meaning of a legal concept by providing interpretations of what a concept means or does not mean. This allow legal professionals to use such interpretations as precedents as well as laymen to better understand the legal concept. The state-of-the-art approach for retrieving the most relevant interpretations for these concepts currently depends on the ranking of sentences and the training of language models over annotated examples. That manual annotation process can be quite expensive and need to be repeated for each such concept, which prompted recent research in trying to automate this process. In this paper, we highlight the results of various experiments conducted to determine the volume, scope and even the need for manual annotation. First of all, we check what is the optimal number of annotations per a legal concept. Second, we check if we can draw the sentences for annotation randomly or there is a gain in the performance of the model, when only the best candidates are annotated. As the last question we check what is the outcome of automating the annotation process with the help of an LLM.

*Xiuwen Wu,Hao Wang,Zhiang Yan,Xiaohan Tang,Pengfei Xu,Wai-Ting Siok,Ping Li,Jia-Hong Gao,Bingjiang Lyu,Lang Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs align with human emotion representation in language, and their emotional output can be controlled using human-centric concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs represent emotions like humans and if their emotional tone can be controlled.

Method: Assessed human-AI emotional alignment using interpretable LLM features for nuanced emotion categories, analyzing valence and arousal.

Result: LLM-derived emotion spaces align with human perception, and human-centric concepts can modulate model expressions.

Conclusion: AI shares emotional representations with humans, and its affective outputs can be precisely guided using psychological concepts.

Abstract: Effective and safe human-machine collaboration requires the regulated and meaningful exchange of emotions between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). Current AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) can provide feedback that makes people feel heard. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs represent emotion in language as humans do, or whether and how the emotional tone of their output can be controlled. We assess human-AI emotional alignment across linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM features translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion categories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived emotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by the fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these emotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data on word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and language-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived solely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can be stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which provides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to systematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when conveying content. These findings suggest AI not only shares emotional representations with humans but its affective outputs can be precisely guided using psychologically grounded emotion concepts.

*Amr Mohamed,Yang Zhang,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle code-switched text, showing mixed performance but potential for improvement through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM performance on code-switched text is crucial due to its prevalence in multilingual online communication.

Method: Systematic evaluation using CSW variants of reasoning benchmarks, testing degradation and improvement scenarios.

Result: Degradation occurs when foreign tokens disrupt English, but embedding English in other languages can improve comprehension. Fine-tuning mitigates degradation better than prompting.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is a stable method to improve LLM comprehension of code-switched text, though performance varies based on language mixing patterns.

Abstract: Code-switching (CSW) is the act of alternating between two or more languages within a single discourse. This phenomenon is widespread in multilingual communities, and increasingly prevalent in online content, where users naturally mix languages in everyday communication. As a result, Large Language Models (LLMs), now central to content processing and generation, are frequently exposed to code-switched inputs. Given their widespread use, it is crucial to understand how LLMs process and reason about such mixed-language text. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLM comprehension under code-switching by generating CSW variants of established reasoning and comprehension benchmarks. While degradation is evident when foreign tokens disrupt English text$\unicode{x2013}$even under linguistic constraints$\unicode{x2013}$embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension. Though prompting yields mixed results, fine-tuning offers a more stable path to degradation mitigation.

TL;DR: MultiFinBen is a multilingual, multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in the financial domain, introducing novel tasks and revealing performance gaps in complex cross-lingual and multimodal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for financial NLP are limited to monolingual and unimodal settings, lacking real-world complexity. MultiFinBen addresses this gap by introducing multilingual and multimodal tasks.

Method: The benchmark includes tasks like PolyFiQA-Easy, PolyFiQA-Expert, EnglishOCR, and SpanishOCR, requiring complex reasoning over mixed-language and visual-text inputs. A dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism ensures a balanced evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models shows significant struggles in handling complex cross-lingual and multimodal financial tasks, despite their general capabilities.

Conclusion: MultiFinBen fosters transparent and inclusive progress in financial NLP by providing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real-world financial scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress in financial NLP and applications, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to monolingual and unimodal settings, often over-relying on simple tasks and failing to reflect the complexity of real-world financial communication. We introduce MultiFinBen, the first multilingual and multimodal benchmark tailored to the global financial domain, evaluating LLMs across modalities (text, vision, audio) and linguistic settings (monolingual, bilingual, multilingual) on domain-specific tasks. We introduce two novel tasks, including PolyFiQA-Easy and PolyFiQA-Expert, the first multilingual financial benchmarks requiring models to perform complex reasoning over mixed-language inputs; and EnglishOCR and SpanishOCR, the first OCR-embedded financial QA tasks challenging models to extract and reason over information from visual-text financial documents. Moreover, we propose a dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism and curate a compact, balanced benchmark rather than simple aggregation existing datasets. Extensive evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models reveals that even the strongest models, despite their general multimodal and multilingual capabilities, struggle dramatically when faced with complex cross-lingual and multimodal tasks in financial domain. MultiFinBen is publicly released to foster transparent, reproducible, and inclusive progress in financial studies and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on embedded clauses relies on schematic examples, missing statistical and natural data from large corpora.

Method: Uses constituency parsing and parsing heuristics to detect and annotate embedded clauses in large-scale text data.

Result: Developed a tool evaluated on GECS and extracted a large dataset of naturally-occurring embedded clauses from Dolma.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable way to study embedded clauses using real-world data, enhancing linguistic research.

Abstract: For linguists, embedded clauses have been of special interest because of their intricate distribution of syntactic and semantic features. Yet, current research relies on schematically created language examples to investigate these constructions, missing out on statistical information and naturally-occurring examples that can be gained from large language corpora. Thus, we present a methodological approach for detecting and annotating naturally-occurring examples of English embedded clauses in large-scale text data using constituency parsing and a set of parsing heuristics. Our tool has been evaluated on our dataset Golden Embedded Clause Set (GECS), which includes hand-annotated examples of naturally-occurring English embedded clause sentences. Finally, we present a large-scale dataset of naturally-occurring English embedded clauses which we have extracted from the open-source corpus Dolma using our extraction tool.

TL;DR: A method to convert autoregressive LMs with BPE tokenizers into character/byte-level LMs, solving tokenization issues like the Prompt Boundary Problem and enabling model interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization introduces distortions (e.g., Prompt Boundary Problem) and hinders model interoperability due to mismatched vocabularies.

Method: Inference-time conversion of BPE-tokenized LMs to character/byte-level LMs without altering generative distribution.

Result: Solves PBP, unifies vocabularies, and enables ensemble/proxy-tuning of models with different tokenizers, improving downstream performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses tokenization issues and enhances model interoperability and performance.

Abstract: Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals.

### [219] [DCRM: A Heuristic to Measure Response Pair Quality in Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14157)
*Chengyu Huang,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCRM, a metric to evaluate response pairs for preference optimization, and proposes a method to improve dataset quality, enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the mismatch between learnable differences in preference datasets and desirable learning outcomes for LLMs.

Method: The authors use distance and reward margin to create DCRM, then analyze and improve preference datasets using best-of-N² pairing.

Result: Higher DCRM correlates with better learning outcomes, and the proposed method outperforms existing datasets on benchmarks.

Conclusion: DCRM and best-of-N² pairing effectively enhance preference optimization performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent research has attempted to associate preference optimization (PO) performance with the underlying preference datasets. In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM. Empirically, in various settings, our method produces training datasets that can further improve models' performance on AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard over the existing training sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The autoregressive nature of LLMs causes high inference latency, hindering real-time applications. Existing speculative sampling methods lack coherence, limiting efficiency.

Method: Proposes S$^4$C, using multi-head drafting for rapid token generation and a continuous verification tree for efficient validation and feature reuse.

Result: S$^4$C outperforms baselines, achieving 2.26x-2.60x acceleration on Spec-bench benchmarks with better efficiency and parallelism.

Conclusion: S$^4$C enhances speculative sampling by leveraging coherence, offering faster and more resource-efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, their autoregressive nature leads to substantial inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Speculative sampling mitigates this issue by introducing a drafting phase followed by a parallel validation phase, enabling faster token generation and verification. Existing approaches, however, overlook the inherent coherence in text generation, limiting their efficiency. To address this gap, we propose a Speculative Sampling with Syntactic and Semantic Coherence (S$^4$C) framework, which extends speculative sampling by leveraging multi-head drafting for rapid token generation and a continuous verification tree for efficient candidate validation and feature reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^4$C surpasses baseline methods across mainstream tasks, offering enhanced efficiency, parallelism, and the ability to generate more valid tokens with fewer computational resources. On Spec-bench benchmarks, S$^4$C achieves an acceleration ratio of 2.26x-2.60x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to evaluate multi-dimensional implicit bias in LLMs' Theory of Mind (ToM) through indirect tasks like WABT and AAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing bias in LLMs' ToM are limited by social desirability effects and fail to capture subtle, multi-dimensional biases.

Method: The framework introduces two indirect tasks: Word Association Bias Test (WABT) and Affective Attribution Test (AAT), designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance.

Result: Experiments on 8 LLMs reveal complex bias structures, including sociability bias, multi-dimensional divergence, and asymmetric stereotype amplification.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust methodology for identifying implicit bias in LLMs' ToM, addressing limitations of conventional methods.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to their capacity for reasoning about mental states, yet failures in this capacity often manifest as systematic implicit bias. Evaluating this bias is challenging, as conventional direct-query methods are susceptible to social desirability effects and fail to capture its subtle, multi-dimensional nature. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework that leverages the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to reconceptualize bias as a multi-dimensional failure in ToM across Competence, Sociability, and Morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks: the Word Association Bias Test (WABT) to assess implicit lexical associations and the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) to measure covert affective leanings, both designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance. Extensive experiments on 8 State-of-the-Art LLMs demonstrate our framework's capacity to reveal complex bias structures, including pervasive sociability bias, multi-dimensional divergence, and asymmetric stereotype amplification, thereby providing a more robust methodology for identifying the structural nature of implicit bias.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative reward model for LLMs, trained with both unlabeled and labeled data, showing improved generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models rely solely on labeled human preference data, limiting their potential. The paper explores combining unsupervised and supervised learning for better performance.

Method: Develops a generative reward model, first trained via unsupervised learning, then fine-tuned with supervised learning. Uses label smoothing to optimize a regularized pairwise ranking loss.

Result: The model generalizes well across tasks like response ranking and reinforcement learning, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: The approach links generative and discriminative models, offering a versatile foundation reward model with minimal fine-tuning needs.

Abstract: In aligning large language models (LLMs), reward models have played an important role, but are standardly trained as discriminative models and rely only on labeled human preference data. In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.

Conclusion: Synthetic CS data offers a cost-effective solution for CS-ASR development, benefiting both research and industry.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), common in multilingual settings, presents challenges for ASR due to scarce and costly transcribed data caused by linguistic complexity. This study investigates building CS-ASR using synthetic CS data. We propose a phrase-level mixing method to generate synthetic CS data that mimics natural patterns. Utilizing monolingual augmented with synthetic phrase-mixed CS data to fine-tune large pretrained ASR models (Whisper, MMS, SeamlessM4T). This paper focuses on three under-resourced Southeast Asian language pairs: Malay-English (BM-EN), Mandarin-Malay (ZH-BM), and Tamil-English (TA-EN), establishing a new comprehensive benchmark for CS-ASR to evaluate the performance of leading ASR models. Experimental results show that the proposed training strategy enhances ASR performance on monolingual and CS tests, with BM-EN showing highest gains, then TA-EN and ZH-BM. This finding offers a cost-effective approach for CS-ASR development, benefiting research and industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in code-switched ASR due to language ambiguity and data scarcity motivate a scalable, efficient solution.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) pre-train decoder on code-switched text, (2) align decoder-encoder with speech-text data, (3) fine-tune entire model.

Result: 9.02% relative WER reduction in Malay-English code-switching; improved monolingual performance in Singlish, Malay, and English variants.

Conclusion: AsyncSwitch effectively leverages web data for code-switched ASR, outperforming prior methods with limited computational cost.

Abstract: Developing code-switched ASR systems is challenging due to language ambiguity and limited exposure to multilingual, code-switched data, while collecting such speech is costly. Prior work generates synthetic audio from text, but these methods are computationally intensive and hard to scale. We introduce AsyncSwitch, a novel asynchronous adaptation framework that leverages large-scale, text-rich web data to pre-expose ASR models to diverse code-switched domains before fine-tuning on paired speech-text corpora. Our three-stage process (1) trains decoder self-attention and feedforward layers on code-switched text, (2) aligns decoder and encoder via cross-attention using limited speech-text data, and (3) fully fine-tunes the entire model. Experiments with Whisper on Malay-English code-switching demonstrate a 9.02% relative WER reduction, while improving monolingual performance in Singlish, Malay, and other English variants.

*Brihi Joshi,Keyu He,Sahana Ramnath,Sadra Sabouri,Kaitlyn Zhou,Souti Chattopadhyay,Swabha Swayamdipta,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELI-Why benchmark evaluates language models' ability to tailor explanations for varied educational levels. GPT-4 explanations match intended grades only 50% of the time, underperforming human-curated ones (79%). Learners also find GPT-4 explanations 20% less suited to their needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve language models' pedagogical capabilities in tailoring explanations for diverse educational backgrounds.

Method: Introduce ELI-Why benchmark (13.4K 'Why' questions), conduct two human studies (educator and learner perspectives), and compare GPT-4 and human-curated explanations.

Result: GPT-4 explanations match intended grades 50% of the time (vs. 79% for humans) and are 20% less suited to learners' needs. Automated metrics fail to distinguish grade-level suitability.

Conclusion: Current language models struggle to tailor explanations effectively for varied educational levels, highlighting a need for improvement in pedagogical capabilities.

Abstract: Language models today are widely used in education, yet their ability to tailor responses for learners with varied informational needs and knowledge backgrounds remains under-explored. To this end, we introduce ELI-Why, a benchmark of 13.4K "Why" questions to evaluate the pedagogical capabilities of language models. We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the utility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our benchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary, high-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the role of an "educator" to assess model explanations' fit to different educational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their intended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay human-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role of a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs. Across all educational backgrounds, users deemed GPT-4-generated explanations 20% less suited on average to their informational needs, when compared to explanations curated by lay people. Additionally, automated evaluation metrics reveal that explanations generated across different language model families for different informational needs remain indistinguishable in their grade-level, limiting their pedagogical effectiveness.

*Jongho Kim,Romain Storaï,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using language models to help anomia patients by addressing term failure and semantic paraphasia errors through gradient-based selective augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomia patients struggle with naming items due to unseen terms and semantic paraphasia. The study aims to improve LM robustness and relevance in such cases.

Method: Proposes gradient-based selective augmentation: gradient value controls data quality, and gradient variance includes unseen terms. Evaluated on Tip-of-the-Tongue and AphasiaBank datasets.

Result: Strong performance against baselines, effectively aiding anomia patients by tackling term failure and semantic errors.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses key challenges in aiding anomia patients, demonstrating the potential of LMs in clinical applications.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of language models (LMs) in aiding patients experiencing anomia, a difficulty identifying the names of items. Identifying the intended target item from patient's circumlocution involves the two challenges of term failure and error: (1) The terms relevant to identifying the item remain unseen. (2) What makes the challenge unique is inherent perturbed terms by semantic paraphasia, which are not exactly related to the target item, hindering the identification process. To address each, we propose robustifying the model from semantically paraphasic errors and enhancing the model with unseen terms with gradient-based selective augmentation. Specifically, the gradient value controls augmented data quality amid semantic errors, while the gradient variance guides the inclusion of unseen but relevant terms. Due to limited domain-specific datasets, we evaluate the model on the Tip-of-the-Tongue dataset as an intermediary task and then apply our findings to real patient data from AphasiaBank. Our results demonstrate strong performance against baselines, aiding anomia patients by addressing the outlined challenges.

TL;DR: AgentSynth is a scalable, cost-efficient pipeline for synthesizing high-quality tasks and datasets for computer-use agents, leveraging information asymmetry to create diverse and challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable and affordable methods to generate high-quality tasks and datasets for training generalist computer-use agents.

Method: Uses an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, an execution agent to complete tasks, and iterative subtask composition to control difficulty.

Result: Generated over 6,000 diverse tasks; state-of-the-art LLM agents showed performance drops from 18% to 4% success across difficulty levels.

Conclusion: AgentSynth is effective, scalable, and cost-efficient, offering a benchmark for evaluating agent performance.

Abstract: We introduce AgentSynth, a scalable and cost-efficient pipeline for automatically synthesizing high-quality tasks and trajectory datasets for generalist computer-use agents. Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power. Moreover, our pipeline achieves a low average cost of \$0.60 per trajectory, orders of magnitude cheaper than human annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality tabular data is hard to obtain due to privacy issues and complexity. Existing methods struggle with mixed-type data.

Method: Introduces CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model with hybrid adaptive causal regularization based on Hierarchical Prior Fusion.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on seven datasets across all metrics.

Conclusion: CausalDiffTab effectively generates mixed tabular data while capturing complex interactions, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Training data has been proven to be one of the most critical components in training generative AI. However, obtaining high-quality data remains challenging, with data privacy issues presenting a significant hurdle. To address the need for high-quality data. Synthesize data has emerged as a mainstream solution, demonstrating impressive performance in areas such as images, audio, and video. Generating mixed-type data, especially high-quality tabular data, still faces significant challenges. These primarily include its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-variable relationships, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model-based generative model specifically designed to handle mixed tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, while being more flexible in capturing complex interactions among variables. We further propose a hybrid adaptive causal regularization method based on the principle of Hierarchical Prior Fusion. This approach adaptively controls the weight of causal regularization, enhancing the model's performance without compromising its generative capabilities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven datasets demonstrate that CausalDiffTab outperforms baseline methods across all metrics.

*Sina Abdidizaji,Md Kowsher,Niloofar Yousefi,Ivan Garibay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved method for detecting implicit influential patterns in digital conversations, leveraging advanced language models to enhance detection accuracy and multi-label classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As digital platforms grow, malicious actors use implicit linguistic strategies to influence users, necessitating better detection methods beyond explicit patterns.

Method: The approach augments existing datasets using state-of-the-art language models to identify and locate implicit influential elements in conversations.

Result: The framework improved implicit pattern detection by 6% and boosted multi-label classification tasks by 33% (techniques) and 43% (victim vulnerability).

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the challenge of detecting implicit influence, offering significant improvements in accuracy and classification.

Abstract: In the era of digitalization, as individuals increasingly rely on digital platforms for communication and news consumption, various actors employ linguistic strategies to influence public perception. While models have become proficient at detecting explicit patterns, which typically appear in texts as single remarks referred to as utterances, such as social media posts, malicious actors have shifted toward utilizing implicit influential verbal patterns embedded within conversations. These verbal patterns aim to mentally penetrate the victim's mind in order to influence them, enabling the actor to obtain the desired information through implicit means. This paper presents an improved approach for detecting such implicit influential patterns. Furthermore, the proposed model is capable of identifying the specific locations of these influential elements within a conversation. To achieve this, the existing dataset was augmented using the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art language models. Our designed framework resulted in a 6% improvement in the detection of implicit influential patterns in conversations. Moreover, this approach improved the multi-label classification tasks related to both the techniques used for influence and the vulnerability of victims by 33% and 43%, respectively.

### [231] [Chaining Event Spans for Temporal Relation Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14213)
*Jongho Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) to improve temporal relation understanding by predicting event time spans, addressing unreliable answer overlaps in tasks like TRC and TRE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on answer overlaps for temporal relation tasks, which can be unreliable due to spurious overlaps. The paper aims to resolve this by grounding answers in predicted timelines.

Method: TRN uses a two-step inductive reasoning process: first answering questions with semantic/syntactic info, then chaining questions to predict a timeline for grounding answers.

Result: TRN outperforms previous methods on TORQUE, TB-dense, TRC, and TRE tasks by effectively resolving spurious overlaps.

Conclusion: The proposed TRN enhances temporal reasoning by leveraging timeline prediction, improving accuracy in tasks requiring temporal relation understanding.

Abstract: Accurately understanding temporal relations between events is a critical building block of diverse tasks, such as temporal reading comprehension (TRC) and relation extraction (TRE). For example in TRC, we need to understand the temporal semantic differences between the following two questions that are lexically near-identical: "What finished right before the decision?" or "What finished right after the decision?". To discern the two questions, existing solutions have relied on answer overlaps as a proxy label to contrast similar and dissimilar questions. However, we claim that answer overlap can lead to unreliable results, due to spurious overlaps of two dissimilar questions with coincidentally identical answers. To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that elicits proper reasoning behaviors through a module for predicting time spans of events. We introduce the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) operating in a two-step inductive reasoning process: In the first step model initially answers each question with semantic and syntactic information. The next step chains multiple questions on the same event to predict a timeline, which is then used to ground the answers. Results on the TORQUE and TB-dense, TRC and TRE tasks respectively, demonstrate that TRN outperforms previous methods by effectively resolving the spurious overlaps using the predicted timeline.

*Md Tanzib Hosain,Salman Rahman,Md Kishor Morol,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Xolver is a multi-agent reasoning framework that enhances LLMs with persistent memory for holistic experience, outperforming specialized models on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack experiential knowledge integration, unlike expert problem solvers who leverage past experiences and collaborative learning.

Method: Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities (retrieval, tool use, collaboration, evaluation, refinement) to avoid generating solutions from scratch.

Result: Xolver outperforms advanced models, achieving top results on benchmarks like GSM8K (98.1%) and AIME'24 (94.4%).

Conclusion: Holistic experience learning is key for advancing toward generalist agents with expert-level reasoning.

Abstract: Despite impressive progress on complex reasoning, current large language models (LLMs) typically operate in isolation - treating each problem as an independent attempt, without accumulating or integrating experiential knowledge. In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or programming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing mentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging knowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on the expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning through trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during competition. We introduce Xolver, a training-free multi-agent reasoning framework that equips a black-box LLM with a persistent, evolving memory of holistic experience. Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities, including external and self-retrieval, tool use, collaborative interactions, agent-driven evaluation, and iterative refinement. By learning from relevant strategies, code fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver avoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated inference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight and proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning agents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses advanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high. With o3-mini-high, it achieves new best results on GSM8K (98.1%), AIME'24 (94.4%), AIME'25 (93.7%), Math-500 (99.8%), and LiveCodeBench-V5 (91.6%) - highlighting holistic experience learning as a key step toward generalist agents capable of expert-level reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MESH, a framework integrating structural and semantic reasoning for temporal knowledge graph prediction, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to combine structural and semantic reasoning or distinguish historical vs. non-historical events, limiting generalization.

Method: MESH uses three expert modules to integrate structural and semantic information for diverse event reasoning.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show MESH's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MESH successfully addresses dual reasoning and temporal context differences, improving prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning aims to predict future events with knowledge of existing facts and plays a key role in various downstream tasks. Previous methods focused on either graph structure learning or semantic reasoning, failing to integrate dual reasoning perspectives to handle different prediction scenarios. Moreover, they lack the capability to capture the inherent differences between historical and non-historical events, which limits their generalization across different temporal contexts. To this end, we propose a Multi-Expert Structural-Semantic Hybrid (MESH) framework that employs three kinds of expert modules to integrate both structural and semantic information, guiding the reasoning process for different events. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel token learning method aligns tool tokens with word embeddings to improve LLMs' tool integration, outperforming baselines in tasks like numerical reasoning and plan generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for integrating tools into LLMs fail to account for relationships between tool and word tokens, limiting adaptability.

Method: Proposes initializing tool token embeddings based on tool names/descriptions, aligning them with word embeddings for better performance.

Result: Demonstrates improvements over baselines (CoT, REACT, ICL, ToolkenGPT) in tasks like numerical reasoning and plan generation.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances LLMs' tool integration by aligning tool tokens with word embeddings, improving accuracy across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet struggle with complex tasks such as numerical reasoning, plan generation. Integrating external tools, such as calculators and databases, into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing problem-solving capabilities. Current methods assign a unique token to each tool, enabling LLMs to call tools through token prediction-similar to word generation. However, this approach fails to account for the relationship between tool and word tokens, limiting adaptability within pre-trained LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel token learning method that aligns tool tokens with the existing word embedding space from the perspective of initialization, thereby enhancing model performance. We begin by constructing prior token embeddings for each tool based on the tool's name or description, which are used to initialize and regularize the learnable tool token embeddings. This ensures the learned embeddings are well-aligned with the word token space, improving tool call accuracy. We evaluate the method on tasks such as numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and embodied plan generation using GSM8K-XL, FuncQA, KAMEL, and VirtualHome datasets. The results demonstrate clear improvements over recent baselines, including CoT, REACT, ICL, and ToolkenGPT, indicating that our approach effectively augments LLMs with tools through relevant tokens across diverse domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task of timely dialogue response generation, proposes the TimelyChat benchmark, and presents Timer, a dialogue agent that predicts time intervals and generates timely responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored aspect of when to respond in dialogues, grounding responses in temporal context.

Method: The method involves creating the TimelyChat benchmark, synthesizing 55K event-driven dialogues using an LLM, and training Timer to predict time intervals and generate timely responses.

Result: Timer outperforms prompting-based LLMs and fine-tuned baselines in evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by releasing the data, model, and code publicly, highlighting the success of Timer in timely response generation.

Abstract: While research on dialogue response generation has primarily focused on generating coherent responses conditioning on textual context, the critical question of when to respond grounded on the temporal context remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel task called timely dialogue response generation and introduce the TimelyChat benchmark, which evaluates the capabilities of language models to predict appropriate time intervals and generate time-conditioned responses. Additionally, we construct a large-scale training dataset by leveraging unlabeled event knowledge from a temporal commonsense knowledge graph and employing a large language model (LLM) to synthesize 55K event-driven dialogues. We then train Timer, a dialogue agent designed to proactively predict time intervals and generate timely responses that align with those intervals. Experimental results show that Timer outperforms prompting-based LLMs and other fine-tuned baselines in both turn-level and dialogue-level evaluations. We publicly release our data, model, and code.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECPO, a multi-turn preference optimization paradigm for Conversational Recommendation Agents (CRAs), addressing short-sighted responses and inefficiencies in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRAs using LLMs often produce unsatisfactory, short-sighted responses, and existing preference optimization methods are costly and ineffective in multi-turn dialogues.

Method: The proposed ECPO leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to model user satisfaction evolution and targets optimization of unsatisfactory responses. It uses AILO, an LLM-based user simulator, for feedback.

Result: ECPO significantly improves CRA interaction capabilities, outperforming existing MTPO methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: ECPO provides a cost-effective and impactful solution for optimizing multi-turn dialogues in CRAs, enhancing user satisfaction and system performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly propelled the development of Conversational Recommendation Agents (CRAs). However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm ECPO, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization. ECPO ingeniously eliminates the significant sampling overhead of existing MTPO methods while ensuring the optimization process drives meaningful improvements. To support ECPO, we introduce an LLM-based user simulator, AILO, to simulate user feedback and perform expectation confirmation during conversational recommendations. Experimental results show that ECPO significantly enhances CRA's interaction capabilities, delivering notable improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness over existing MTPO methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the choice of reference sets affects reference-based summarization metrics, revealing instability in popular metrics like ROUGE and weak correlation with human judgments, especially for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked variation in human language production and its impact on summarization evaluation, particularly the sensitivity of metrics to reference sets.

Method: Analyzes three multi-reference datasets (SummEval, GUMSum, DUC2004) and human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data.

Result: Popular metrics (e.g., ROUGE) show instability, with model rankings varying by reference sets, and weak-to-no correlation with human judgments for LLMs.

Conclusion: Recommends incorporating reference set variation in evaluation to improve consistency and alignment with human judgments, especially for LLMs.

Abstract: Human language production exhibits remarkable richness and variation, reflecting diverse communication styles and intents. However, this variation is often overlooked in summarization evaluation. While having multiple reference summaries is known to improve correlation with human judgments, the impact of using different reference sets on reference-based metrics has not been systematically investigated. This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation. Taken together, we recommend incorporating reference set variation into summarization evaluation to enhance consistency alongside correlation with human judgments, especially when evaluating LLMs.

Result: The vision outlines a path for developing geo-temporally aware systems to enhance AI-driven information access.

Conclusion: Integrating geo-temporal reasoning into deep research systems can significantly improve their utility in context-rich domains.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed information access, with current LLMs also powering deep research systems that can generate comprehensive report-style answers, through planned iterative search, retrieval, and reasoning. Still, current deep research systems lack the geo-temporal capabilities that are essential for answering context-rich questions involving geographic and/or temporal constraints, frequently occurring in domains like public health, environmental science, or socio-economic analysis. This paper reports our vision towards next generation systems, identifying important technical, infrastructural, and evaluative challenges in integrating geo-temporal reasoning into deep research pipelines. We argue for augmenting retrieval and synthesis processes with the ability to handle geo-temporal constraints, supported by open and reproducible infrastructures and rigorous evaluation protocols. Our vision outlines a path towards more advanced and geo-temporally aware deep research systems, of potential impact to the future of AI-driven information access.

TL;DR: Google's search algorithms bias visibility by suppressing certain subreddits/hashtags (e.g., explicit content, conspiracy theories) and promoting high-engagement content, shaping public discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how search engines like Google act as gatekeepers by selectively curating social media content, influencing what information users see.

Method: Comparison of Google search results with nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X to identify algorithmic biases.

Result: Google suppresses subreddits/hashtags related to explicit content, conspiracies, ads, and crypto, while favoring high-engagement content.

Conclusion: Google's algorithmic curation systematically influences public discourse by controlling the visibility of social media narratives.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role as digital gatekeepers, shaping the visibility of Web and social media content through algorithmic curation. This study investigates how search engines like Google selectively promotes or suppresses certain hashtags and subreddits, impacting the information users encounter. By comparing search engine results with nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X, we reveal systematic biases in content visibility. Google's algorithms tend to suppress subreddits and hashtags related to sexually explicit material, conspiracy theories, advertisements, and cryptocurrencies, while promoting content associated with higher engagement.

*Lucile Favero,Daniel Frases,Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz,Tanja Käser,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-step LLM framework for generating critical questions to enhance deeper reasoning in debates, winning a shared task competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs promoting superficial learning led to exploring their role in fostering critical thinking by challenging unsupported claims.

Method: A two-step framework using small-scale open-source LLMs: a Questioner generates candidate questions, and a Judge selects the most relevant ones.

Result: The system ranked first in the shared task, proving its effectiveness in encouraging critical engagement with argumentative texts.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based approach successfully promotes deeper reasoning, demonstrating potential for critical question generation in debates.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of chat interfaces based on Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about promoting superficial learning and undermining the development of critical thinking skills. Instead of relying on LLMs purely for retrieving factual information, this work explores their potential to foster deeper reasoning by generating critical questions that challenge unsupported or vague claims in debate interventions. This study is part of a shared task of the 12th Workshop on Argument Mining, co-located with ACL 2025, focused on automatic critical question generation. We propose a two-step framework involving two small-scale open source language models: a Questioner that generates multiple candidate questions and a Judge that selects the most relevant ones. Our system ranked first in the shared task competition, demonstrating the potential of the proposed LLM-based approach to encourage critical engagement with argumentative texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-NUBench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of sentence-level negation, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing exclusively on negation and its diverse forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks treat negation as a secondary aspect, lacking dedicated evaluation for negation understanding in LLMs.

Method: The benchmark includes manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset to assess models' ability to handle diverse negation forms like local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase.

Result: Thunder-NUBench provides a specialized tool for evaluating LLMs' negation understanding, going beyond surface-level cues.

Conclusion: The benchmark fills a critical gap in evaluating LLMs' semantic understanding of negation, offering a focused and comprehensive assessment.

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that poses persistent challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring deep semantic understanding. Existing benchmarks often treat negation as a side case within broader tasks like natural language inference, resulting in a lack of benchmarks that exclusively target negation understanding. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Thunder-NUBench}, a novel benchmark explicitly designed to assess sentence-level negation understanding in LLMs. Thunder-NUBench goes beyond surface-level cue detection by contrasting standard negation with structurally diverse alternatives such as local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase. The benchmark consists of manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset that enables in-depth evaluation of models' negation understanding.

### [242] [ImpliRet: Benchmarking the Implicit Fact Retrieval Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14407)
*Zeinab Sadat Taghavi,Ali Modarressi,Yunpu Ma,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ImpliRet is a benchmark focusing on document-side reasoning for retrieval systems, where relevance depends on implicit facts in documents. Current retrievers and models struggle, with GPT-4.1 achieving only 35.06% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval benchmarks focus on query-side processing, but ImpliRet shifts the challenge to document-side reasoning, addressing implicit relationships like temporal, arithmetic, and world knowledge.

Method: ImpliRet evaluates sparse and dense retrievers, as well as long-context models like GPT-4.1, using simple queries where relevance hinges on implicit document facts.

Result: Current retrievers perform poorly (best nDCG@10: 15.07%), and even GPT-4.1 scores only 35.06% with a short context.

Conclusion: Document-side reasoning remains a significant challenge, highlighting the need for improved retrieval systems capable of handling implicit information.

Abstract: Retrieval systems are central to many NLP pipelines, but often rely on surface-level cues such as keyword overlap and lexical semantic similarity. To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present ImpliRet, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving "two days ago"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships. We evaluate a range of sparse and dense retrievers, all of which struggle in this setting: the best nDCG@10 is only 15.07%. We also test whether long-context models can overcome this limitation. But even with a short context of only ten documents, including the positive document, GPT-4.1 scores only 35.06%, showing that document-side reasoning remains a challenge. Our codes are available at github.com/ZeinabTaghavi/IMPLIRET.Contribution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the long-context capabilities of diffusion LLMs, comparing them to auto-regressive LLMs. It identifies stable perplexity and local perception in diffusion LLMs, proposes LongLLaDA for context extension, and benchmarks performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored long-context capabilities of diffusion LLMs and compare them with auto-regressive LLMs, providing insights and methods for context extension.

Method: Systematic comparison of diffusion and auto-regressive LLMs, analysis of perplexity and local perception, and proposal of LongLLaDA (training-free method using NTK-based RoPE extrapolation).

Result: Diffusion LLMs show stable perplexity and local perception, outperforming auto-regressive LLMs in some long-context tasks. LongLLaDA effectively extends context windows.

Conclusion: The study establishes the first context extrapolation method for diffusion LLMs, offering theoretical insights and benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models, or diffusion LLMs, have emerged as a significant focus in NLP research, with substantial effort directed toward understanding their scalability and downstream task performance. However, their long-context capabilities remain unexplored, lacking systematic analysis or methods for context extension. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation comparing the long-context performance of diffusion LLMs and traditional auto-regressive LLMs. We first identify a unique characteristic of diffusion LLMs, unlike auto-regressive LLMs, they maintain remarkably \textbf{\textit{stable perplexity}} during direct context extrapolation. Furthermore, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct \textbf{\textit{local perception}} phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments. We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short. Consequently, this study establishes the first context extrapolation method for diffusion LLMs while providing essential theoretical insights and empirical benchmarks critical for advancing future research on long-context diffusion LLMs.

*Jiayin Wang,Zhiquang Guo,Weizhi Ma,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper advocates for evaluating Test-time Learning (TTL) in LLMs using semantic games, highlighting gaps between LLMs and humans in dynamic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on static knowledge, but intelligence requires dynamic learning. The paper aims to assess LLMs' ability to learn during test time.

Method: Proposes semantic games as testbeds for TTL, with an evaluation framework comparing performance under limited vs. cumulative experience. Includes human baseline.

Result: LLMs show measurable TTL capabilities but improve less stably and slowly than humans under cumulative experience.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential as learning machines but lag behind humans in dynamic learning, regardless of static benchmark performance.

Abstract: As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines, while also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans, irrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks.

### [245] [LexiMark: Robust Watermarking via Lexical Substitutions to Enhance Membership Verification of an LLM's Textual Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14474)
*Eyal German,Sagiv Antebi,Edan Habler,Asaf Shabtai,Yuval Elovici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiMark is a stealthy dataset watermarking method using synonym substitutions for high-entropy words to detect unauthorized LLM training without altering text semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods lack stealth and are easily detectable, necessitating a more subtle approach.

Method: LexiMark embeds synonym substitutions for selected high-entropy words to enhance LLM memorization without semantic changes.

Result: Evaluations on multiple LLMs and settings show improved AUROC scores, proving LexiMark's effectiveness.

Conclusion: LexiMark reliably verifies unauthorized data use in LLMs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be trained or fine-tuned on data obtained without the owner's consent. Verifying whether a specific LLM was trained on particular data instances or an entire dataset is extremely challenging. Dataset watermarking addresses this by embedding identifiable modifications in training data to detect unauthorized use. However, existing methods often lack stealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove. In light of these limitations, we propose LexiMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for text and documents, which embeds synonym substitutions for carefully selected high-entropy words. Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization capabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of the text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending seamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal due to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated and manual detection. We evaluated our method using baseline datasets from recent studies and seven open-source models: LLaMA-1 7B, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Pythia 6.9B, as well as three smaller variants from the Pythia family (160M, 410M, and 1B). Our evaluation spans multiple training settings, including continued pretraining and fine-tuning scenarios. The results demonstrate significant improvements in AUROC scores compared to existing methods, underscoring our method's effectiveness in reliably verifying whether unauthorized watermarked data was used in LLM training.

*Jiyuan Fu,Kaixun Jiang,Lingyi Hong,Jinglun Li,Haijing Guo,Dingkang Yang,Zhaoyu Chen,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingoLoop is an attack exploiting MLLMs' vulnerabilities by inducing verbose and repetitive outputs, increasing tokens and energy consumption significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior attacks on MLLMs neglect token-level POS and sentence-level patterns, limiting their effectiveness. LingoLoop addresses these gaps.

Method: Uses POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to delay EOS tokens and Generative Path Pruning to enforce repetitive loops.

Result: Increases generated tokens by up to 30x and energy consumption comparably, pushing MLLMs to their limits.

Conclusion: LingoLoop exposes critical MLLM vulnerabilities, challenging reliable deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great promise but require substantial computational resources during inference. Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These findings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their reliable deployment. The code will be released publicly following the paper's acceptance.

*Di He,Ajay Jaiswal,Songjun Tu,Li Shen,Ganzhao Yuan,Shiwei Liu,Lu Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlphaDecay adaptively assigns weight decay strengths to LLM modules based on their spectral properties, improving performance over uniform decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform weight decay overlooks structural diversity in LLMs. AlphaDecay addresses this by leveraging spectral properties for adaptive decay.

Method: AlphaDecay uses Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization theory to analyze weight correlation matrices, assigning decay strengths based on spectral 'heavy-tailedness.'

Result: AlphaDecay outperforms uniform decay and other baselines in perplexity and generalization across model sizes (60M to 1B).

Conclusion: Adaptive weight decay based on spectral properties enhances LLM performance, validating AlphaDecay's effectiveness.

Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

*David Wan,Eran Hirsch,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Ido Dagan,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenerationPrograms is a modular framework for text generation that improves attribution quality and interpretability by decomposing the process into executable program plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack fine-grained attributions and interpretability in source-conditioned text generation, undermining trust and verifiability.

Method: GenerationPrograms splits generation into two stages: creating an executable program plan with modular text operations and executing it to produce the final response.

Result: The framework significantly improves attribution quality at document and sentence levels in QA and summarization tasks, and outperforms traditional post-hoc attribution methods.

Conclusion: GenerationPrograms enhances attribution and interpretability, enabling localized refinements for better performance.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in source-conditioned text generation but often fail to correctly provide fine-grained attributions for their outputs, undermining verifiability and trust. Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models leverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses, limiting interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable "code agent" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions. In addition, the interpretable programs generated by GenerationPrograms enable localized refinement through modular-level improvements that further enhance overall attribution quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of translating low-level programs between CISC and RISC architectures due to fundamental differences, aiming to enhance code portability and longevity.

Method: Uses LLMs for candidate translations and embeds them in a software-testing framework to ensure correctness. Evaluated on diverse datasets with high code coverage.

Result: Achieves 99% correctness on HumanEval and 49% on BringupBench, outperforms Rosetta 2 in runtime (1.73x), energy efficiency (1.47x), and memory usage (2.41x).

Conclusion: GG is effective for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation, with plans to open-source tools to advance ISA-level code translation research.

Abstract: The hardware ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with increasing interest in translating low-level programs across different instruction set architectures (ISAs) in a quick, flexible, and correct way to enhance the portability and longevity of existing code. A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.

TL;DR: Adding AMR to NLI improves GPT-4o slightly in prompting but harms generalization in fine-tuning. Gains stem from surface-level differences, not semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AMR enhances NLI by improving semantic parsing in pretrained models.

Method: Integrate AMR into NLI via fine-tuning and prompting, then analyze performance and conduct ablation studies.

Result: AMR in fine-tuning hinders generalization; prompting with AMR slightly improves GPT-4o but misleads models due to surface-level differences.

Conclusion: AMR's benefits in NLI are superficial, as it amplifies surface cues rather than aiding semantic reasoning.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) relies heavily on adequately parsing the semantic content of the premise and hypothesis. In this work, we investigate whether adding semantic information in the form of an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) helps pretrained language models better generalize in NLI. Our experiments integrating AMR into NLI in both fine-tuning and prompting settings show that the presence of AMR in fine-tuning hinders model generalization while prompting with AMR leads to slight gains in \texttt{GPT-4o}. However, an ablation study reveals that the improvement comes from amplifying surface-level differences rather than aiding semantic reasoning. This amplification can mislead models to predict non-entailment even when the core meaning is preserved.

TL;DR: A framework synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a consensus, realigning deviating models via embedding optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in LLMs' moral reasoning for complex dilemmas.

Method: Aggregate moral acceptability scores into a collective probability, fine-tune misaligned models via embedding optimization.

Result: Improved consensus and individual model fidelity on moral dilemmas.

Conclusion: Data-driven moral alignment enhances AI safety and consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive moral reasoning abilities. Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust consensus and improves individual model fidelity. These findings highlight the value of data-driven moral alignment across multiple models and its potential for safer, more consistent AI systems.

TL;DR: LLMs show potential for coding open-ended survey responses, but performance varies by model and context. Fine-tuning is often necessary for satisfactory results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the applicability and performance of LLMs in coding open-ended survey responses, especially in non-English contexts like German data.

Method: Comparison of several state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting approaches, evaluated against human expert codings.

Result: Performance varies significantly between LLMs; fine-tuning is required for accuracy. Prompting effectiveness depends on the LLM. Uneven performance across categories affects distribution.

Conclusion: LLMs can be useful but require careful consideration of trade-offs (e.g., fine-tuning, model choice) for reliable use in survey research.

Abstract: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

TL;DR: Recent strong LLMs like Qwen2.5 don't benefit from traditional or enhanced CoT exemplars in ICL for math tasks; models focus on instructions, not exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether CoT exemplars still enhance reasoning in advanced LLMs like Qwen2.5, given their improved capabilities.

Method: Systematic experiments comparing traditional and enhanced CoT exemplars (using answers from advanced models) in ICL for math tasks.

Result: No improvement in reasoning performance with CoT exemplars; models ignore exemplars and focus on instructions.

Conclusion: Current ICL+CoT framework has limitations in math reasoning, requiring re-examination of ICL paradigms and exemplar definitions.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how fine-tuned LLMs contribute to ideological polarization in online discourse.

Method: Fine-tuned an open-source LLM on politically charged Reddit data, evaluated outputs via linguistic analysis, sentiment scoring, and human annotation.

Result: LLMs produced highly plausible, provocative comments indistinguishable from human-written ones, exacerbating polarization.

Conclusion: Highlights ethical risks of AI in political discourse, calling for governance, regulation, and detection tools to mitigate adversarial fine-tuning.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing concerns regarding their potential role in exacerbating ideological polarization through the automated generation of persuasive and biased content. This study explores the extent to which fine-tuned LLMs can replicate and amplify polarizing discourse within online environments. Using a curated dataset of politically charged discussions extracted from Reddit, we fine-tune an open-source LLM to produce context-aware and ideologically aligned responses. The model's outputs are evaluated through linguistic analysis, sentiment scoring, and human annotation, with particular attention to credibility and rhetorical alignment with the original discourse. The results indicate that, when trained on partisan data, LLMs are capable of producing highly plausible and provocative comments, often indistinguishable from those written by humans.

TL;DR: GuiLoMo introduces a fine-grained strategy for allocating expert numbers and ranks in LoRA-MoE models, using GuidedSelection Vectors (GSVs) to improve performance by addressing task-specific and model-specific needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA-MoE methods suffer from limitations in expert assignment and uniform rank allocation, restricting their potential.

Method: Proposes GuiLoMo, which uses GSVs learned via bilevel optimization to allocate expert numbers and ranks adaptively.

Result: GuiLoMo outperforms baselines on diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of adaptive expert configuration.

Conclusion: Adaptive expert allocation enhances LoRA-MoE performance, with insights into layer- and task-specific variations.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), offer an efficient way to adapt large language models with reduced computational costs. However, their performance is limited by the small number of trainable parameters. Recent work combines LoRA with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), i.e., LoRA-MoE, to enhance capacity, but two limitations remain in hindering the full exploitation of its potential: 1) the influence of downstream tasks when assigning expert numbers, and 2) the uniform rank assignment across all LoRA experts, which restricts representational diversity. To mitigate these gaps, we propose GuiLoMo, a fine-grained layer-wise expert numbers and ranks allocation strategy with GuidedSelection Vectors (GSVs). GSVs are learned via a prior bilevel optimization process to capture both model- and task-specific needs, and are then used to allocate optimal expert numbers and ranks. Experiments on three backbone models across diverse benchmarks show that GuiLoMo consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines. Further analysis offers key insights into how expert numbers and ranks vary across layers and tasks, highlighting the benefits of adaptive expert configuration.

TL;DR: The paper investigates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models, identifying key dataset properties and layer-wise changes, with perplexity as a strong predictor of effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand SFT's role in aligning LLMs with human instructions and values, given its poorly understood aspects.

Method: Trained 1,000+ SFT models on diverse datasets (code, math, general tasks) under controlled conditions, analyzing dataset properties and layer-wise modifications.

Result: Found persistent training-task synergies, perplexity as a strong predictor of SFT effectiveness, and mid-layer weight changes correlating with performance gains.

Conclusion: Model-specific strategies are crucial, and the release of 1,000+ SFT models aims to accelerate further research.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a critical step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human instructions and values, yet many aspects of SFT remain poorly understood. We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness--often surpassing superficial similarity between trained data and benchmark--and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains. We will release these 1,000+ SFT models and benchmark results to accelerate further research.

*Daniel D'souza,Julia Kreutzer,Adrien Morisot,Ahmet Üstün,Sara Hooker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses improving machine learning model performance on underrepresented, long-tail use cases by optimizing training protocols and introducing control levers for better inference-time adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models often underperform on rare or underrepresented features despite being trained for diverse tasks. Existing methods like prompt engineering are unreliable and inflexible.

Method: The authors revisit training-inference techniques, create a taxonomy of data characteristics for explicit/implicit control, and fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically.

Result: The approach improves performance, with a 5.7% average win rate lift in open-ended generation and over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains. Specific tasks like CodeRepair see up to 14.1% relative improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances controllability and long-tail performance, offering significant gains in underrepresented use cases while maintaining flexibility.

Abstract: One of the most profound challenges of modern machine learning is performing well on the long-tail of rare and underrepresented features. Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: "Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains. We also observe relative lifts of up to 14.1% on underrepresented tasks like CodeRepair and absolute improvements of 35.3% on length instruction following evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how model architecture and data configurations affect the memorization capacity of generative transformers, using synthetic text datasets from SNOMED. Key findings highlight embedding size as critical for learning, while additional layers offer limited benefits. Softmax activation proves stable, and data complexity enhances memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer architectures and data setups influence memorization capacity, particularly for structured real-world data like SNOMED.

Method: Train generative transformers on synthetic text datasets (triplets and sequences) derived from SNOMED. Analyze the impact of embedding size, layers, and activation functions.

Result: Embedding size is the main factor for learning speed and capacity. Extra layers may hurt performance on simpler data. Softmax is stable, and complex data improves memorization.

Conclusion: The study clarifies transformer memory mechanisms and offers a framework for optimizing model design with structured data.

Abstract: This paper studies how the model architecture and data configurations influence the empirical memorization capacity of generative transformers. The models are trained using synthetic text datasets derived from the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) knowledge graph: triplets, representing static connections, and sequences, simulating complex relation patterns. The results show that embedding size is the primary determinant of learning speed and capacity, while additional layers provide limited benefits and may hinder performance on simpler datasets. Activation functions play a crucial role, and Softmax demonstrates greater stability and capacity. Furthermore, increasing the complexity of the data set seems to improve the final memorization. These insights improve our understanding of transformer memory mechanisms and provide a framework for optimizing model design with structured real-world data.

TL;DR: Ring-lite is a MoE-based LLM optimized via RL, achieving SOTA performance with fewer activated parameters. It introduces C3PO for stable RL training, entropy-based checkpoint selection, and a two-stage training paradigm for multi-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and robust reasoning model that matches SOTA performance while using fewer parameters, addressing challenges in MoE RL training.

Method: Joint training pipeline combining distillation and RL, introducing C3PO for stability, entropy-based checkpoint selection, and a two-stage training paradigm for multi-domain data.

Result: Matches SOTA performance on benchmarks (AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) with one-third activated parameters.

Conclusion: Ring-lite demonstrates efficient reasoning via MoE and RL, with innovations in training stability and multi-domain integration. Model, dataset, and code will be released.

Abstract: We present Ring-lite, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language model optimized via reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and robust reasoning capabilities. Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a 16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by comparable models. To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL training. First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology. Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training. Finally, we develop a two-stage training paradigm to harmonize multi-domain data integration, addressing domain conflicts that arise in training with mixed dataset. We will release the model, dataset, and code.

*Daixuan Cheng,Shaohan Huang,Xuekai Zhu,Bo Dai,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zhenliang Zhang,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of entropy in enhancing exploratory reasoning in language models (LMs) by linking high-entropy regions to key reasoning actions. A simple entropy-based modification to RL improves reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the imbalance between exploration and exploitation in LMs, which often leads to performance plateaus, by leveraging entropy as a signal for exploratory reasoning.

Method: Augmenting the advantage function in RL with an entropy-based term to promote longer and deeper reasoning chains, rather than just uncertainty.

Result: Strong correlations between entropy and exploratory reasoning actions, with significant gains on the Pass@K metric, even for large K values.

Conclusion: Entropy-based exploration in RL effectively enhances LM reasoning, pushing the boundaries of their capabilities.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation is a central goal in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite recent advances in enhancing language model (LM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover strong positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LM reasoning.

### [262] [From Bytes to Ideas: Language Modeling with Autoregressive U-Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14761)
*Mathurin Videau,Badr Youbi Idrissi,Alessandro Leite,Marc Schoenauer,Olivier Teytaud,David Lopez-Paz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an autoregressive U-Net that dynamically embeds tokens during training, replacing static tokenization methods like BPE, enabling multi-scale text processing and improved semantic prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static tokenization methods like BPE limit model flexibility and granularity, freezing input processing and prediction scope. The goal is to overcome this rigidity by learning token embeddings dynamically.

Method: An autoregressive U-Net is proposed, which processes raw bytes into multi-scale embeddings (words, word pairs, up to 4 words). Deeper stages predict further into the future, focusing on broader semantics.

Result: Shallow hierarchies match strong BPE baselines, while deeper hierarchies show promising trends. The model adapts to character-level tasks and transfers knowledge across low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Dynamic tokenization within the model enhances flexibility, multi-scale processing, and cross-task/language adaptability, outperforming static methods like BPE.

Abstract: Tokenization imposes a fixed granularity on the input text, freezing how a language model operates on data and how far in the future it predicts. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and similar schemes split text once, build a static vocabulary, and leave the model stuck with that choice. We relax this rigidity by introducing an autoregressive U-Net that learns to embed its own tokens as it trains. The network reads raw bytes, pools them into words, then pairs of words, then up to 4 words, giving it a multi-scale view of the sequence. At deeper stages, the model must predict further into the future -- anticipating the next few words rather than the next byte -- so deeper stages focus on broader semantic patterns while earlier stages handle fine details. When carefully tuning and controlling pretraining compute, shallow hierarchies tie strong BPE baselines, and deeper hierarchies have a promising trend. Because tokenization now lives inside the model, the same system can handle character-level tasks and carry knowledge across low-resource languages.

*Li-Wei Chen,Takuya Higuchi,Zakaria Aldeneh,Ahmed Hussen Abdelaziz,Alexander Rudnicky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-to-end variational method to automatically encode continuous speech attributes into semantic tokens, improving speech naturalness without manual feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech token methods focus on linguistic aspects and neglect prosody, leading to unnatural speech. Adding pitch features is insufficient and requires manual effort.

Method: An end-to-end variational approach is introduced to learn and encode continuous speech attributes into semantic tokens automatically.

Result: The method eliminates manual feature extraction and produces speech continuations preferred by human raters.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances speech naturalness by automatically encoding paralinguistic attributes, outperforming manual feature-based methods.

Abstract: The success of large language models in text processing has inspired their adaptation to speech modeling. However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters. Code, samples and models are available at https://github.com/b04901014/vae-gslm.
