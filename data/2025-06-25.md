### [1] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous agents in tribes use communication signals to coordinate and improve efficiency, developing a shared culture through learning. The NEC-DAC system shows how culture and cooperation impact performance, with signals enabling cultural transmission across generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous agents develop and transmit culture through communication signals, and how this affects their collective efficiency and cooperation.

Method: Using the NEC-DAC system, agents with neural networks learn and signal to form a shared culture. Different social structures (e.g., authority hierarchies) are analyzed to study cooperation and performance.

Result: Culture of cooperation significantly impacts tribe performance. Signals facilitate cultural emergence and transmission across generations, enhancing coordination.

Conclusion: Communication signals and shared culture improve agent coordination and efficiency, with implications for understanding collective behavior in autonomous systems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [2] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores strategic randomization in LLMs using a zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, evaluating five LLMs' ability to randomize decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of strategic randomization in LLMs and disentangle cognitive randomization from mechanical randomness generation.

Method: Proposes a zero-sum game with Nash equilibrium as maximal entropy strategy, evaluates LLMs across prompt styles (framed, neutral, hinted) in competitive gameplay.

Result: Weaker models stay deterministic; stronger models randomize more with hints. Strong LLMs exploit weaker ones deterministically but approach equilibrium with peers.

Conclusion: LLMs show varied strategic reasoning, highlighting gaps in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. Implementation is open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [3] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques Shojaee et al.'s (2025) claim of a reasoning cliff in Large Reasoning Models, attributing the performance collapse to experimental constraints rather than inherent limitations. It demonstrates improved performance with agentic tools, suggesting the issue lies in execution, not reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conclusion that reasoning models have intrinsic scaling limitations by identifying experimental artifacts and proposing an alternative explanation involving system-level constraints.

Method: The authors reframe the observed failure as an agentic gap, empirically testing models with agentic tools to solve problems beyond the previously identified reasoning cliff.

Result: Models equipped with agentic tools successfully solve problems they previously failed, indicating the issue is execution, not reasoning. A hierarchy of agentic reasoning is also identified.

Conclusion: The perceived reasoning deficit in LRMs is due to restrictive interfaces, not fundamental cognitive limitations. Agentic tools enable models to overcome these constraints, redefining how machine intelligence is measured.

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

### [4] [From Rows to Yields: How Foundation Models for Tabular Data Simplify Crop Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19046)
*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabPFN, a foundation model for tabular data, is applied to sub-national yield forecasting in South Africa, showing comparable accuracy to ML models but with faster tuning and less feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of TabPFN in agricultural yield forecasting, leveraging its advantages over traditional ML models.

Method: Used dekadal EO and weather data, aggregated monthly, to forecast crop yields. Benchmarked TabPFN against six ML and three baseline models using leave-one-year-out cross-validation.

Result: TabPFN and ML models had similar accuracy, outperforming baselines, but TabPFN offered faster tuning and simpler implementation.

Conclusion: TabPFN is more practical for real-world yield forecasting due to its efficiency and ease of use.

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

### [5] [Baba is LLM: Reasoning in a Game with Dynamic Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19095)
*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to play Baba is You, a 2D puzzle game involving rule manipulation. Larger models like GPT-4o perform better, while smaller unadapted models struggle. Finetuning helps analyze levels but not solve puzzles, revealing challenges in reasoning about dynamic rule changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reasoning and language abilities through a game that combines both, using rule manipulation as a test case.

Method: Six LLMs were tested with three prompt types (simple, rule-extended, action-extended). Two models (Mistral, OLMo) were finetuned with game data.

Result: Larger models (e.g., GPT-4o) performed better, but smaller models struggled. Finetuning improved level analysis but not solution formulation.

Conclusion: LLMs, even state-of-the-art ones, find reasoning about dynamic rule changes challenging. Games like Baba is You are useful for testing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [6] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GITes, a framework combining spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita with GPT-4o to improve emotional support. It benchmarks GITes against 12 LLMs, showing significant improvements in NLP and spiritual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mental health support lacks depth. Integrating spiritual wisdom with AI aims to address deeper emotional needs.

Method: Developed the GITes dataset with spiritually guided responses, benchmarked against 12 LLMs, and proposed a Spiritual Insight metric for evaluation.

Result: Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct showed improvements: 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score, and 15.92% in Spiritual Insight.

Conclusion: AI enriched with spiritual guidance has strong potential to enhance emotional support, but real-world validation is needed.

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

### [7] [Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for AI systems with probabilistic agents using Bayesian inference, competition, and belief revision to evolve toward truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a mathematically rigorous AI system where truth emerges from structured competition and belief updates among agents.

Method: Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, updating beliefs via Bayesian inference and reproducing based on truth-aligned utility comparisons. Cryptographic identities and causal inference ensure traceability and robustness.

Result: The system proves convergence, robustness, and evolutionary stability, with truth as an attractor.

Conclusion: Verifiable knowledge emerges from adversarial competition in a self-regulating, computable swarm.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [8] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GBGC, a multi-granularity graph coarsening method using granular-ball computing, improving efficiency and accuracy over spectrum-preserving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph coarsening methods focus on spectrum-preserving but ignore multi-granularity subregions, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: GBGC adaptively splits the graph into granular-balls of optimal granularity, using them as supernodes for coarsening.

Result: GBGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in speed (10-100x faster) and accuracy, with lower time complexity.

Conclusion: GBGC's robustness and efficiency make it a promising standard for graph data preprocessing.

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

### [9] [RecLLM-R1: A Two-Stage Training Paradigm with Reinforcement Learning and Chain-of-Thought v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19235)
*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecLLM-R1 is a recommendation framework using LLMs and GRPO to improve accuracy, diversity, and business alignment, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address filter bubbles, underutilized knowledge, and misalignment between model optimization and business policies.

Method: Transforms data into LLM prompts, uses SFT for basic training, and GRPO with CoT for multi-objective optimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, diversity, and novelty on real-world data.

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1 mitigates filter bubbles and aligns recommendations with complex business goals.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

### [10] [Emotion Detection on User Front-Facing App Interfaces for Enhanced Schedule Optimization: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19280)
*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating emotion detection into calendar apps using biometric (HR/ECG) and behavioral (computer activity) methods, finding the latter more consistent and accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance productivity and engagement in HCI by adapting interfaces to users' emotional states.

Method: Two approaches: biometric (HR/ECG with LSTM/GRU) and behavioral (computer activity with ML models).

Result: Behavioral method outperformed, with 90% accuracy for mouse interactions; GRU beat LSTM (84.38% for Valence).

Conclusion: Behavioral emotion detection is more effective, offering potential for adaptive interfaces.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

*Liang Zeng,Yongcong Li,Yuzhen Xiao,Changshi Li,Chris Yuhao Liu,Rui Yan,Tianwen Wei,Jujie He,Xuchen Song,Yang Liu,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an automated data-curation pipeline for SWE datasets, achieving SOTA performance with the Skywork-SWE model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the time-consuming manual annotation and limited scale of existing SWE datasets.

Method: Introduces an incremental, automated pipeline to scale dataset volume and diversity, fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE model.

Result: Achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy (47.0% with scaling), setting a new SOTA for sub-32B models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable data improves LLM performance in SWE, releasing the model for future research.

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

*Hyein Seo,Taewook Hwang,Yohan Lee,sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEAT is a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback in English education, using three datasets (DM, DG, DA) combining human and AI efforts. Adding a small portion of high-quality data (DM) to AI-generated data (DG) improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality teacher feedback data for AI tutoring systems is costly and time-consuming to produce manually.

Method: Proposed FEAT framework with three datasets: DM (human+AI), DG (AI-only), and DA (DG+small DM). Evaluated performance by blending DM into DG.

Result: Adding 5-10% DM to DG outperforms using 100% DM alone.

Conclusion: FEAT balances cost and quality, enhancing AI tutoring systems with minimal high-quality data.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

*Debosmita Bhaumik,Julian Togelius,Georgios N. Yannakakis,Ahmed Khalifa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a search-based method for repairing non-functional game levels, using evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, combined with PCGML for generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of repairing non-functional game levels while minimizing changes, ensuring completeness and performance.

Method: Uses evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms for level repair, applied to levels generated by PCGML.

Result: Demonstrates promising results as a hybrid PCG method combining PCGML and search-based repair.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach of PCGML and search-based repair is effective for creating functional and stylistically appropriate game levels.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

*Ziqi Zhu,Tao Hu,Honglong Zhang,Dan Yang,HanGeng Chen,Mengran Zhang,Xilun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG improves multi-turn customer service dialogues by combining intent-based graph traversal with semantic search, outperforming traditional RAG systems in coherence and goal progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue systems struggle with maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in multi-turn conversations.

Method: CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic intent transition graphs and uses a dual-retrieval mechanism to balance intent-based traversal and semantic search.

Result: Significant improvements over baselines: 11% BLEU, 5% ROUGE-L, 6% METEOR, and 58% better response quality in LLM-as-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG effectively integrates intent and semantic retrieval, addressing challenges in knowledge-intensive dialogues.

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

Motivation: To assess OCR's potential beyond scene decomposition, focusing on reasoning and generalization in multi-object robotic tasks.

Method: Created simulated robotic manipulation tasks with randomization and compared OCR against holistic representations.

Result: OCR outperforms holistic methods in complex scenarios with structured scenes.

Conclusion: OCR is promising for robotic tasks but needs improvement for robustness in difficult settings.

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

*Yazhou Zhang,Chunwang Zou,Bo Wang,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commander-GPT, a modular framework using specialized LLM agents and commanders, improves sarcasm detection by 4.4-11.7% over SoTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sarcasm understanding despite strong performance in other NLP tasks, prompting the need for a specialized framework.

Method: Commander-GPT employs a team of specialized LLM agents for sub-tasks (e.g., context modeling, sentiment analysis) and three types of commanders to integrate outputs for sarcasm judgment.

Result: Achieves 4.4% and 11.7% F1 score improvement on MMSD benchmarks over SoTA baselines.

Conclusion: The modular approach of Commander-GPT effectively enhances sarcasm understanding, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome traditional RAG's shortcomings (e.g., retrieval drift, rigidity) in complex reasoning tasks.

### [19] [NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500)
*Yan Jiang,Hao Zhou,LiZhong GU,Ai Han,TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent introduces a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling in LLMs, outperforming baselines in task success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with static knowledge and fragile tool invocation, hindering complex toolchain orchestration at scale. Existing methods lack flexibility and error recovery.

Method: NaviAgent uses a Multi-Path Decider for dynamic action selection and a Graph-Encoded Navigator with a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG) and heuristic search.

Result: NaviAgent achieves higher task success rates (13.5%-19.0% over baselines) and efficient execution, with fine-tuned models surpassing larger ones.

Conclusion: NaviAgent's architecture, especially the Graph-Encoded Navigator, significantly improves toolchain orchestration, balancing quality and efficiency.

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

*Carlo Romeo,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NTRL automates D&D combat encounter balancing via reinforcement learning, outperforming human DMs by enhancing difficulty and strategy while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual balancing in D&D is complex and disrupts narrative flow; NTRL automates this to improve gameplay.

Method: Uses contextual bandit reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust encounters based on party attributes.

Result: Extends combat longevity (+200%), increases damage (-16.67% post-combat HP), and raises player deaths without total party kills, while ensuring 70% win rates.

Conclusion: NTRL enhances strategic depth and fairness, outperforming human-designed encounters.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining ASP-derived rules with black-box ML improves accuracy and interpretability in healthcare predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing ML methods lack interpretability, while symbolic methods like ASP lack predictive power. The goal is to merge both for better trust and performance.

Method: Integrates FOLD-R++ algorithm's ASP-derived rules with black-box ML classifiers to correct uncertain predictions and provide explanations.

Result: Experiments on five medical datasets show significant gains in accuracy and F1 score.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with ML enhances interpretability without compromising accuracy, benefiting high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TAPAS is a multi-agent framework combining LLMs and symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without manual environment models, using collaborative agents and tool-based interactions for adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving complex tasks without manually defined environment models by leveraging LLMs and multi-agent collaboration.

Method: Uses specialized LLM-based agents for dynamic domain model generation and adaptation, coupled with ReAct-style execution and natural language plan translation.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and the VirtualHome simulated environment.

Conclusion: TAPAS effectively integrates LLMs and symbolic planning for adaptive task-solving, showing promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

### [23] [ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608)
*Zhiyuan Wang,Bokui Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChordPrompt, a framework for continual learning in vision-language models, addressing limitations in existing prompt learning methods by leveraging cross-modal interactions and domain-adaptive prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods lack strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning and neglect cross-modal information exchange, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ChordPrompt uses cross-modal prompts for visual-textual interaction and domain-adaptive text prompts for continual adaptation across domains.

Result: ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance on multi-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChordPrompt enhances continual learning in vision-language models by harmonizing visual and textual prompts, improving adaptability and performance across domains.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs), a closed-loop framework integrating cognitive and embodied AI to overcome limitations in scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI and automated labs lack flexibility and physical adaptability, hindering autonomous hypothesis testing and serendipitous discovery.

Method: ISLs combine foundation models for reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for physical experimentation.

Result: The framework promises iterative, autonomous experimentation and transformative AI-driven science.

Conclusion: ISLs are essential for advancing scientific discovery by unifying cognitive and embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

### [25] [Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19650)
*Simon Ferreira,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the do-calculus to identify macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs, proving its unconditional soundness and completeness, unlike in ADMGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often involve cyclic causal dynamics and high-dimensional settings, making fully specified ADMGs impractical. Partially specified causal representations like C-DMGs are needed.

Method: The study uses input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) to generalize SCMs, allowing cycles, and analyzes C-DMGs over DMGs.

Result: The do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs. Graphical criteria for non-identifiability also extend to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Conclusion: The findings enhance causal effect identification in cyclic, high-dimensional systems, bridging gaps in practical applications of causal inference.

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

*Ching Fang,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers, mimicking episodic memory, enable rapid in-context reinforcement learning, differing from standard methods and resembling brain processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind rapid adaptation in learning, inspired by human and animal efficiency, using transformers as a model for episodic memory.

Method: Training a transformer on in-context reinforcement learning tasks inspired by rodent behavior and analyzing the emergent learning algorithms.

Result: The model uses memory tokens to cache computations, differing from standard reinforcement learning, and aligns representations across environments, resembling hippocampal-entorhinal brain processes.

Conclusion: Memory serves as a computational resource for flexible behavior, offering insights into rapid adaptation in both artificial and natural learning systems.

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

*Zhuojun Xie,Adam Abdin,Yiping Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework for predictive maintenance (PdM) to address suboptimal decisions caused by prediction errors in traditional methods. It shows improved robustness and decision quality, reducing maintenance regret by up to 22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty from model misspecification limits industrial adoption of ML in PdM. The study aims to align predictive models with maintenance objectives to mitigate errors.

Method: The IEO framework jointly tunes predictive models while optimizing maintenance outcomes, using a stochastic perturbation gradient descent algorithm for small datasets.

Result: Empirical evaluations show IEO reduces average maintenance regret by up to 22% compared to traditional ETO methods.

Conclusion: The IEO framework improves decision quality and robustness in PdM, especially when policies are misaligned with objectives, supporting reliable maintenance planning in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and improve accuracy in differential diagnosis tasks using unstructured medical records.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA-v3 with low-rank adaptation, leveraging the DDXPlus dataset for pathology prediction and differential diagnosis.

Result: Superior performance in predictive accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The platform offers a reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving AI solution for clinical healthcare applications.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis

TL;DR: AutoExperiment is a benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to implement and run ML experiments from research papers, scaling difficulty by masking code functions. Performance drops as complexity rises, highlighting challenges in code generation and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack evaluation of AI agents' ability to implement scientific ideas with varying code starting points, from reproduction to full replication.

Method: Agents are given a paper, a codebase with masked functions, and a command to run the experiment. They must generate missing code, execute it, and reproduce results, with difficulty scaling by the number of missing functions.

Result: Performance degrades as task complexity increases. Dynamic interaction with environments improves outcomes, and there's a gap between single-shot and multi-trial success rates.

Conclusion: AutoExperiment addresses critical challenges in AI-driven scientific experimentation, serving as a benchmark for progress in autonomous code generation and execution.

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafting task-specific prompts for LLMs in KG construction is labor-intensive and brittle. Automatic prompt optimization can address this challenge.

Method: The study evaluates automatic prompt optimization by varying prompting strategies, LLMs, schema complexity, text length, optimization metrics, and datasets. It tests three optimizers (DSPy, APE, TextGrad) on SynthIE and REBEL datasets.

Result: Automatic prompt optimization generates human-like prompts and improves triple extraction results, particularly with higher schema complexity and larger texts.

Conclusion: Automatic prompt optimization is effective for triple extraction, offering a scalable alternative to manual prompt crafting.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

*Teng Wang,Hailei Gong,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE, a strategy-guided RL framework with novel reward shaping, improves dense retrieval by leveraging expert-crafted strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results and efficient rewrites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current query rewriting methods require large supervised data or face inefficient RL exploration, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Introduces SAGE, which uses expert-crafted strategies (e.g., semantic expansion) in an RL framework with Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS).

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, reduces exploration, and lowers inference cost while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Strategy-guided RL with nuanced reward shaping offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable paradigm for robust information retrieval.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

*Menglong Zhang,Fuyuan Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimBelief is a meta-RL framework using task belief similarity in BAMDPs for efficient exploration and adaptation in sparse reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in sparse reward environments where traditional methods struggle with task identification and exploitation.

Method: Introduces latent task belief metric to learn common task structures and integrates it with specific task features for rapid adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward tasks in MuJoCo and panda-gym.

Conclusion: SimBelief effectively identifies and adapts to tasks by leveraging task belief similarity, improving performance in sparse reward scenarios.

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

*Baochang Ren,Shuofei Qiao,Wenhao Yu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowRL integrates a factuality reward into RL training to reduce hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs by ensuring fact-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing severe hallucination in slow-thinking LLMs due to unclear knowledge boundaries and lack of factual supervision in RL.

Method: Proposes Knowledge-enhanced RL (KnowRL), adding a factuality reward based on knowledge verification to guide fact-based reasoning.

Result: KnowRL reduces hallucinations while preserving reasoning capabilities, validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models by reinforcing fact-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs are used to analyze diagrams for adherence to data visualization principles, showing effectiveness in identifying issues like missing labels but struggling with image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers often misuse diagrams, leading to misinformation. Automating analysis with VLMs can help identify and correct such issues.

Method: Five VLMs and five prompting strategies are tested on questions derived from visualization guidelines to evaluate their suitability for diagram analysis.

Result: VLMs excel in analyzing diagram types, 3D effects, axes labels, and legends but perform poorly on image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting are top performers.

Conclusion: VLMs can automate the identification of diagram issues, with potential for broader application in data visualization.

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

*Guo Li,Zixiang Xu,Wei Zhang,Yikuan Hu,Xinyu Yang,Nikolay Aristov,Mingjie Tang,Elenna R Dugundji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Temporal-IRL, a model using Inverse Reinforcement Learning to predict port congestion by analyzing vessel behavior and berth scheduling, achieving strong results with data from Maher Terminal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate port congestion prediction is vital for supply chain reliability, enabling better planning, cost reduction, and timely deliveries.

Method: The study uses AIS data to reconstruct berth schedules and applies Temporal-IRL to learn scheduling patterns and predict vessel sequencing and stay times.

Result: The model, tested on Maher Terminal data (2015-2023), demonstrated excellent performance in forecasting port congestion.

Conclusion: Temporal-IRL effectively predicts port congestion by learning berth scheduling priorities, enhancing supply chain resilience.

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

TL;DR: JoyAgents-R1 proposes Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for MARL, enhancing sampling efficiency and training stability while achieving optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing cooperative inefficiency and training instability in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Method: Uses GRPO with node-wise Monte Carlo sampling and a marginal benefit-driven selection strategy for targeted updates. Introduces adaptive memory evolution for faster convergence.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to larger LLMs using smaller open-source models in general and domain-specific scenarios.

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1 effectively balances efficiency, stability, and performance in heterogeneous MARL.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

*Ganesh Parab,Zishan Ahmad,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HI-SQL improves Text-to-SQL generation by using historical query logs to generate hints, enhancing accuracy and efficiency for complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL methods struggle with complex queries (multi-table joins, nested conditions) due to high computational costs, latency, and error-prone multi-step pipelines.

Method: HI-SQL introduces a hint generation mechanism using historical query logs to guide SQL generation, simplifying the process and reducing reliance on human prompts.

Result: Experiments show HI-SQL improves query accuracy and efficiency (fewer LLM calls, lower latency) on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HI-SQL offers a robust, practical solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems by leveraging historical data to handle complex queries effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

*Shuang Ao,Yi Dong,Jinwei Hu,Sarvapali Ramchurn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLoRA improves LLM safety alignment by pruning unsafe LoRA layers, using E-DIEM for detection, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA can weaken safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing harmful outputs. Existing methods fail to address complex parameter shifts.

Method: Proposes SPLoRA, a pruning-based approach using E-DIEM to detect and remove unsafe LoRA layers, balancing safety and performance.

Result: SPLoRA reduces safety risks, maintains or improves performance, and lowers inference overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPLoRA is a scalable, efficient solution for safer and more reliable LLMs, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) is a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with sequential expert communication, improving performance and efficiency over traditional MoE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the representational capacity and flexibility of expert selection in MoE models by introducing iterative expert communication.

Method: CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts within a layer, using dynamic routing at each step to select experts.

Result: CoE reduces validation loss (1.20 to 1.12 on math tasks) and offers memory-efficient scaling (17.6-42% reduction).

Conclusion: CoE's iterative routing and residual structure improve performance and efficiency, providing a new scaling axis for MoE models.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

Motivation: To address challenges like untimely detection and monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies.

Method: Integrates mechanism-based and data-driven analysis, using hierarchical feature extraction and a self-attention mechanism for dynamic feature weight calibration.

Result: Achieves RMSE of 0.0281, outperforming benchmarks by 15.6-25.7%. Mixed feature modeling and attention mechanism contribute 22.4% and 11.2% improvements, respectively.

Conclusion: The MFA-ANN model offers an efficient, reliable solution for intelligent quality control in injection molding, with adaptability to varying conditions and noise resistance.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning pipeline using SHM sensor networks and GNNs achieves high-accuracy traffic monitoring, outperforming CV-based and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CV-based (privacy, lighting) and non-vision methods (deployment inflexibility) for bridge traffic monitoring.

Method: Integrates CV-assisted dataset generation with GNNs to process SHM sensor data, transferring CV knowledge to sensors.

Result: Achieves 99% accuracy for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles in real-world testing.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables automated, accurate traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention, bridging gaps in current methods.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

TL;DR: Learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks address challenges in dynamic prediction tasks for critical care, offering reliable interpretations by incorporating temporal continuity and label consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability is crucial for deploying deep learning models in critical care, but existing methods struggle with dynamic prediction tasks due to time-varying dependencies and temporal smoothness.

Method: The work analyzes failure modes of gradient, occlusion, and permutation-based methods and proposes learnable mask-based frameworks to incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency.

Result: Learnable mask-based approaches provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for dynamic time-series prediction in critical care.

Conclusion: Learnable mask-based methods are superior for interpretability in dynamic prediction tasks, especially in critical care.

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Result: Generated data deviates <10% from real data on causal fairness metrics and reduces bias by 70% on sensitive attributes.

Conclusion: This work advances fair synthetic data access, supporting equitable health research and healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

### [46] [Benchmarking Music Generation Models and Metrics via Human Preference Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19085)
*Florian Grötschla,Ahmet Solak,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates music generation models by comparing human preferences with objective metrics, ranking state-of-the-art models and providing an open dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing music generation models is challenging due to the subjective nature of human preferences and the lack of reliable objective metrics.

Method: Generated 6k songs using 12 models, conducted 15k pairwise comparisons with 2.5k participants to correlate human preferences with metrics.

Result: Ranked state-of-the-art models and metrics based on human preference, identifying gaps in current evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better alignment between human preferences and objective metrics, offering an open dataset to advance the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created
compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human
preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of
generated music and human evaluations.

### [47] [Finetuning a Weather Foundation Model with Lightweight Decoders for Unseen Physical Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19088)
*Fanny Lehmann,Firat Ozdemir,Benedikt Soja,Torsten Hoefler,Siddhartha Mishra,Sebastian Schemm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates Aurora, an AI weather foundation model, for predicting hydrological variables not included in pretraining. A lightweight decoder approach outperforms full fine-tuning in efficiency and accuracy, highlighting the model's ability to capture physical relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if foundation models like Aurora can predict new hydrological variables without full retraining, making them more accessible for Earth sciences.

Method: Compare a lightweight decoder trained on Aurora's latent space to full fine-tuning, measuring training time, memory, and accuracy.

Result: The decoder approach is 50% faster, uses 35% less memory, and maintains accuracy, showing Aurora's latent space encodes meaningful physical relationships.

Conclusion: Foundation models should be extendable to new variables without full fine-tuning, enhancing accessibility and adoption in Earth sciences.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

### [48] [On the algorithmic construction of deep ReLU networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19104)
*Daan Huybrechs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural networks as algorithms, constructing exact solutions like sorting, and analyzes their recursive and parallel nature compared to conventional algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically understand what neural networks can represent, beyond training on data, by treating them as algorithms.

Method: Constructs neural networks (e.g., for sorting) explicitly, analyzing their properties like recursion, parallelism, and depth.

Result: Neural networks as algorithms are recursive, parallel, and benefit from depth, though constrained by continuity.

Conclusion: Constructed networks reveal superior properties with depth, offering insights into their expressivity and limitations.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

*Kenneth L. Clarkson,Lior Horesh,Takuya Ito,Charlotte Park,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can exactly implement Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering, proving their capability to learn precise algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if transformers can learn and implement exact algorithms, specifically Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering.

Method: Theoretical proof of a transformer architecture (k-means transformer) using attention and residual connections, followed by numerical implementation and experiments.

Result: Exact correspondence between the transformer and Lloyd's algorithm, plus novel clustering variants from interpretable alterations.

Conclusion: Transformers can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering interpretable implementations of exact algorithms.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

*Andreas Bjerregaard,Søren Hauberg,Anders Krogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Riemannian generative decoder to simplify manifold-valued representation learning by avoiding complex density approximations and optimizing latents directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Riemannian representation learning involve difficult density approximations and manifold constraints, limiting their applicability.

Method: The proposed method uses a Riemannian optimizer to find manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents and trains a decoder network, eliminating the need for an encoder.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, the method captures non-Euclidean structure and aligns latent spaces with data geometry.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies manifold learning, is compatible with existing architectures, and produces interpretable latent spaces.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned using a local learning rule, with gradients derived from force measurements or observed dynamics. It validates this with a network of nonlinear oscillators, testing on a 2D Gaussian mixture and MNIST digit sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol in SGMs can be learned efficiently using local learning rules, leveraging force measurements or system dynamics.

Method: Implemented an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. Applied to sampling from a 2D Gaussian mixture and trained on MNIST digit images.

Result: Successfully learned the driving protocol via local rules, demonstrated by sampling from a Gaussian mixture and generating MNIST digits.

Conclusion: Local learning rules can effectively train SGMs, as shown by practical applications in sampling and image generation.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

*Barry Wang,Avi Schwarzschild,Alexander Robey,Ali Payani,Charles Fleming,Mingjie Sun,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Command-V is a backpropagation-free method for transferring behaviors between LLMs by copying residual activation adapters, requiring minimal compute and no original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid costly full finetuning or distillation for behavior transfer in LLMs, which must be repeated per architecture.

Method: Profiles layer activations, derives linear converters between layers, and applies donor interventions in the recipient's activation space.

Result: Matches or exceeds direct finetuning performance in safety-refusal, jailbreak, and chain-of-thought reasoning, with much less compute.

Conclusion: Command-V offers an efficient, compute-light alternative to traditional behavior transfer methods in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

### [53] [Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143)
*Paul C. Bogdan,Uzay Macar,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three sentence-level attribution methods to analyze reasoning in large language models, identifying "thought anchors" that disproportionately influence reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing interpretability challenges in long-form chain-of-thought reasoning by decomposing the process at the sentence level.

Method: Three methods: (1) black-box counterfactual importance, (2) white-box attention pattern aggregation, and (3) causal attribution via attention suppression.

Result: Identified "thought anchors" (e.g., planning or backtracking sentences) that significantly influence reasoning.

Conclusion: Sentence-level analysis enhances understanding of reasoning models, supported by consistent findings across methods.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

*Amir Faiyaz,Tara Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradualDiff-Fed is a federated learning framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) efficiently by transmitting only weight differences, reducing communication costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs in specialized domains like medical science, addressing challenges in performance and large model sizes in federated learning.

Method: Introduces GradualDiff-Fed, which transmits only model weight differences during training rounds to reduce communication costs and improve scalability.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized training while significantly reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed is an efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs in distributed, privacy-preserving settings without compromising performance.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to distill tool knowledge into LLMs via natural language, improving math problem-solving without inference-time tool dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with exact computation and multi-step algebraic reasoning, and tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) introduces scalability issues.

Method: Uses a Solver Agent for planning and tool calls, then converts TIR traces into natural language via back-translation with Translator and Rephrase Agents.

Result: Fine-tuning a small model on synthesized traces improves performance on math benchmarks without tool access.

Conclusion: The approach successfully internalizes tool knowledge and reasoning patterns, enhancing LLM capabilities for math tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

### [56] [Private Model Personalization Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19220)
*Conor Snedeker,Xinyu Zhou,Raef Bassily*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a differentially private federated learning algorithm for model personalization, improving privacy and utility guarantees under heterogeneous user data and noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of privately recovering shared embeddings and local representations in federated learning with heterogeneous user data and noisy labels.

Method: A private, efficient federated learning algorithm based on FedRep, incorporating differential privacy and handling sub-Gaussian user distributions. Uses Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform for dimension reduction.

Result: Improved privacy error term by a factor of ~O(dk) and dimension-independent risk bounds under margin loss in binary classification.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates feasibility of dimension-independent risk bounds and enhanced privacy in federated learning for model personalization.

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study singularity formation in PDEs using high-precision PINNs, combining numerical solutions with rigorous proofs and analysis.

Method: Modularized approach involving neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization algorithm, combined with computer-assisted proofs and PDE analysis.

Result: High-precision solutions for 1D Burgers and 2D Boussinesq equations, with improved loss compared to prior work.

Conclusion: PINNs with high precision can effectively study singularities in PDEs, with potential for extending to higher-dimensional problems at machine precision.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

Result: Proves the universality of several positive definite kernels on Riemannian symmetric spaces, validating their theoretical use.

Conclusion: The work advances kernel method theory for non-Euclidean domains, supporting practical applications with manifold-valued data.

Abstract: The universality properties of kernels characterize the class of functions

are of fundamental importance in the theoretical underpinning of kernel methods
in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a federated contrastive learning method for anomaly detection in distributed systems, addressing privacy, heterogeneity, and pattern recognition challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of centralized anomaly detection methods, focusing on data privacy, node heterogeneity, and fine-grained anomaly recognition.

Method: Combines federated learning with contrastive learning, using local embeddings and sample pairs to train a global model without raw data exposure.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability, effective in detecting complex anomalies in distributed environments.

Conclusion: Balances privacy and performance, offering a viable solution for intelligent security in distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

*Hadi Khalaf,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Alex Oesterling,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Flavio du Pin Calmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward hacking in large language models (LLMs) by proposing hedging strategies to mitigate overoptimization for imperfect reward models. It introduces Best-of-Poisson (BoP) and HedgeTune for efficient alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models are imperfect proxies for alignment goals, leading to reward hacking, where overoptimization reduces performance. The work aims to characterize and mitigate this issue.

Method: The study analyzes reward hacking under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), introduces Best-of-Poisson (BoP), and proposes HedgeTune for optimal inference-time alignment.

Result: Hedging mitigates reward hacking and achieves better tradeoffs between reward and distortion with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Hedging is an effective tactical choice to avoid overconfidence in proxy rewards, and HedgeTune offers a practical solution for inference-time alignment.

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

*Shili Wu,Yizhao Jin,Puhua Niu,Aniruddha Datta,Sean B. Andersson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using global Lipschitz regularization to enhance the robustness of Behavior Cloning (BC) policies against measurement errors and adversarial disturbances, providing a robustness certificate and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BC policies can be misled by measurement errors or adversarial disturbances during deployment, leading to sub-optimal actions.

Method: A global Lipschitz regularization approach is used to ensure the robustness of the learned policy network, with a proposed method to construct a Lipschitz neural network.

Result: The global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate for the policy against bounded norm perturbations, validated empirically in Gymnasium environments.

Conclusion: Lipschitz regularization effectively enhances BC policy robustness, offering a practical solution for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

*Yang Zhou,Xiaoning Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance drops in Graph OOD classification due to imbalance and noise, proposing CMO and NNR methods to improve robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph OOD classification struggles with minority class underperformance and sensitivity to structural noise, requiring solutions for better generalization.

Method: Proposes Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) for minority class robustness and Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) for dynamic noise mitigation.

Result: Theoretical justification and experiments on synthetic/real-world datasets show improved Graph OOD generalization and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: CMO and NNR effectively address imbalance and noise challenges, enhancing Graph OOD performance.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

*Yang Zhou,Xiaoning Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BADGNN addresses temporal continuity disruption in MDGNNs by introducing TLR and A3, enabling larger batch sizes and faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large batch sizes in MDGNNs disrupt event sequences, causing temporal information loss and hindering optimization.

Method: Proposes BADGNN with Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) and Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to control parameter search space and attention distortion.

Result: BADGNN outperforms TGN, maintaining performance with larger batch sizes and faster training on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: BADGNN effectively preserves temporal continuity and improves training efficiency in dynamic graph neural networks.

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

### [64] [Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19289)
*Yan Li,Zengli Yang,Youhuai Wang,Jing Wang,Xiaoyu Han,Jingyu Wang,Dongyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based method (PGNN) for the Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem in relay setting calculation, improving accuracy and computation speed for online applications in renewable power systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volatility in power systems due to renewable energy necessitates faster and more accurate online relay setting calculations, which existing methods fail to deliver.

Method: A parallel graph neural network (PGNN) processes power system data structured into four layers (component parameter, topological connection, electrical distance, graph distance) to predict extreme operating conditions.

Result: The PGNN method outperforms existing methods in accuracy and significantly reduces online computation time, validated on modified IEEE test systems.

Conclusion: The proposed PGNN method is effective for online EOCS, addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy integration in power systems.

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

### [65] [The Effect of Depth on the Expressivity of Deep Linear State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19296)
*Zeyu Bao,Penghao Yu,Haotian Jiang,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how depth and width affect the expressiveness of deep linear state-space models (SSMs), showing equivalence under unconstrained parameters but divergence under norm constraints, with deep SSMs outperforming shallow ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how depth and width influence the expressive capacity of deep linear SSMs, addressing a gap in theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are used to compare depth and width in deep linear SSMs, including proofs and constructive methods under norm constraints.

Result: Depth and width are equivalent without parameter constraints, but depth is more expressive under norm constraints. Upper bounds on minimal depth for representation are derived.

Conclusion: Deep linear SSMs are more expressive than shallow ones under norm constraints, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks can evade Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids. A novel attack framework using Fast Gradient Sign Method is proposed, showing high vulnerability of DLS models. Adversarial training is introduced as a defense, improving robustness without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in existing DLSs for FDIA detection in smart grids and propose a defense mechanism.

Method: Proposes an adversarial attack framework using Fast Gradient Sign Method to exploit DLS vulnerabilities. Evaluates robustness of various deep learning models under adversarial conditions. Introduces adversarial training as a defense.

Result: Existing DLS models are highly vulnerable (attack success rate >99.7%). Adversarial training significantly improves robustness without affecting fault detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to DLS-based FDIA detection. Robust cybersecurity measures, like adversarial training, are essential for smart grids.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

TL;DR: CroMoTEX is a contrastive learning framework that uses chest X-rays to enhance ECG representations for diagnosing cardiac pathologies, achieving high performance without needing CXRs at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ECG-based cardiac diagnosis by leveraging richer CXR data during training, enabling scalable deployment where CXRs are unavailable.

Method: Uses a supervised cross-modal contrastive objective with adaptive hard negative weighting to align ECG and CXR representations.

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving up to 78.31 AUROC on edema in large-scale datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR).

Conclusion: CroMoTEX effectively enhances ECG representations for cardiac pathology diagnosis, demonstrating scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) in crash data using database narrative alignment and BERT, analyzing 371,062 Iowa crash records (2016-2022). Findings reveal 24.03% AIM, with patterns linked to crash types, and suggest targeted training for better reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road traffic crashes are a major global cause of fatalities, requiring accurate data for prevention and policy. AIM in crash data undermines this accuracy.

Method: Developed a framework using database narrative alignment and BERT to analyze 371,062 Iowa crash records (2016-2022). Probit Logit models and geospatial clustering were also employed.

Result: Identified 2,767 AIM incidents (24.03% of total). Alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents had lower AIM, while unknown vehicle types and older drivers had higher AIM.

Conclusion: Targeted training and improved data management are needed to reduce AIM and enhance crash reporting accuracy for evidence-based policymaking.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGMAE improves graph representation learning by reconstructing discrepancy information in heterophilic graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in heterophilic graphs due to ignoring node discrepancies, leading to indistinguishable representations.

Method: Proposes DGMAE, which reconstructs discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during masking.

Result: DGMAE preserves node discrepancies and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification, clustering, and graph classification.

Conclusion: DGMAE effectively addresses limitations in heterophilic graphs and demonstrates superior performance in graph tasks.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

TL;DR: Transformers in-context learning (ICL) adapts to hierarchical task complexities, favoring simplest explanations, akin to Bayesian Occam's razor, validated on GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle tasks of varying complexity in ICL, especially when examples fit multiple hypotheses.

Method: Controlled testbeds (Markov chains, linear regression) and theoretical Bayesian framework to analyze transformer behavior.

Result: Transformers identify task complexity levels and parameters accurately, preferring simplest sufficient explanations.

Conclusion: Transformers exhibit an inherent Occam's razor-like bias, balancing fit and complexity, validated on GPT-4.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

TL;DR: Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS) is introduced to optimize EMS design by hierarchically exploring high-dimensional spaces, reducing evaluation costs by 75-85%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EMS design methods are data-intensive and struggle with real-world constraints, prompting the need for a scalable, budget-friendly solution.

Method: PQS converts layouts into quadtree-based hierarchical representations for progressive search and uses a consistency-driven mechanism to balance prediction reliability.

Result: PQS outperforms baselines, achieving satisfactory designs under limited budgets and cutting evaluation costs by 75-85%.

Conclusion: PQS is a scalable, efficient solution for EMS design, significantly reducing computational costs and design cycles.

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited exploration and insufficient coordination in MARL under sparse rewards.

Method: Proposes FIM with three components: identifying CoG state dimensions, counterfactual intrinsic rewards, and eligibility-trace-based credit accumulation.

Result: FIM significantly improves cooperative performance in diverse MARL benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FIM effectively enhances targeted cooperation in sparse reward MARL settings.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tag-based causal discovery method improves robustness by assigning multiple tags to variables, leveraging existing methods and tag relations to direct edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing type-based causal discovery lacks flexibility due to single-type assignments, prompting a need for a more robust approach.

Method: Proposes a tag-based approach: apply existing methods to direct some edges, determine tag relations, and use these to direct undirected edges.

Result: Experimental evaluations show improved causal discovery and alignment with common knowledge.

Conclusion: The tag-based method enhances flexibility and robustness in causal discovery compared to single-type approaches.

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the well-known bias problems in Q-value estimation that hinder convergence in reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes a locally adaptive overestimation control method built on distributional RL, requiring minimal code changes.

Result: Theoretical evidence and experiments in tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo environments demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework is simple to implement and improves existing distributional algorithms with adaptive overestimation control.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

TL;DR: FastEGNN and DistEGNN enhance equivariant GNNs for large-scale geometric graphs, improving efficiency and performance on sparse or distributed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant GNNs struggle with efficiency and performance on large or sparsified graphs.

Method: FastEGNN uses virtual nodes for approximation and distinct message passing, while DistEGNN extends this to distributed settings.

Result: Superior efficiency and performance on benchmarks like N-body systems and Fluid113K.

Conclusion: The models advance large-scale equivariant graph learning, with code available for further use.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual

FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,

### [79] [Recalling The Forgotten Class Memberships: Unlearned Models Can Be Noisy Labelers to Leak Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19486)
*Zhihao Sui,Liang Hu,Jian Cao,Dora D. Liu,Usman Naseem,Zhongyuan Lai,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in Machine Unlearning (MU) by proposing a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework to recover class memberships from unlearned models without needing the original model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MU attack research requires access to original models, violating privacy goals. This study addresses the gap by investigating attacks on unlearned models directly.

Method: A teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture is used, treating unlearned models as noisy labelers. The problem is framed as Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) to infer forgotten instance labels.

Result: Experiments show MRA effectively recovers class memberships of unlearned instances across state-of-the-art MU methods and real datasets.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities, highlighting privacy risks in unlearning technologies.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

*Zhihao Sui,Liang Hu,Jian Cao,Usman Naseem,Zhongyuan Lai,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COLUR is a framework for restoring model performance degraded by noisy labels, using unlearning and relearning inspired by neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in models due to noisy labels lacks effective solutions, prompting the need for a restoration method.

Method: COLUR employs a co-training architecture to unlearn noisy labels and refine model confidence for relearning.

Result: COLUR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real datasets.

Conclusion: The COLUR framework effectively restores model performance by addressing noisy label issues through unlearning and relearning.

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

### [81] [Dimension Reduction for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19537)
*Paul Kahlmeyer,Markus Fischer,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve symbolic regression by identifying and substituting variable combinations, enhancing algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression struggles with complex formulas due to many variables and operators. Exploiting fixed variable combinations can simplify the problem.

Method: The method searches for small valid substitutions in the expression space and tests their validity using functional dependence tests, iteratively reducing dimensions.

Result: The approach reliably finds valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Conclusion: Iterative dimension reduction via substitution is effective for improving symbolic regression, especially for complex formulas.

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

### [82] [Overtuning in Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19540)
*Lennart Schneider,Bernd Bischl,Matthias Feurer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates overtuning, a form of overfitting in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), showing it's more common than assumed and can degrade generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if excessive optimization of validation error in HPO leads to overfitting (overtuning), a phenomenon underexplored in literature.

Method: Formally defines overtuning, distinguishes it from related concepts, and conducts a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data.

Result: Overtuning is prevalent (10% cases severe), often mild but can select suboptimal configurations. Factors like dataset size and HPO method influence it.

Conclusion: Raises awareness of overtuning, especially in small-data regimes, and calls for further study on mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

*Paul Kahlmeyer,Niklas Merk,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression is adapted to find Lie point symmetries for ODEs, outperforming existing CASs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated solving of nonlinear ODEs is challenging, and existing CASs struggle with finding Lie point symmetries.

Method: Search-based symbolic regression is adapted to identify generators of Lie point symmetries.

Result: The approach successfully finds symmetries that current CASs cannot detect.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression offers a promising alternative for solving ODEs by uncovering hidden symmetries.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

### [84] [ConCM: Consistency-Driven Calibration and Matching for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19558)
*QinZhe Wang,Zixuan Chen,Keke Huang,Xiu Su,Chunhua Yang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConCM, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that optimizes feature-structure dual consistency to mitigate knowledge conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for FSCIL suffer from prototype deviation and fixed embedding spaces, limiting expressiveness. The paper aims to address these issues by ensuring consistency in features and structures.

Method: Proposes ConCM with memory-aware prototype calibration for feature consistency and dynamic structure matching for adaptive alignment to optimal manifold spaces.

Result: ConCM outperforms existing methods by 3.20% and 3.68% on mini-ImageNet and CUB200 benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by combining feature calibration and dynamic structure alignment, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

### [85] [FAF: A Feature-Adaptive Framework for Few-Shot Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19567)
*Pengpeng Ouyang,Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Shuo Feng,Zhao Jin,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAF, a framework for multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting, addressing data scarcity by leveraging generalized and task-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail due to insufficient historical data and lack of feature generalization. FAF aims to improve forecasting by combining generalized and task-specific knowledge.

Method: FAF uses three modules: GKM for generalized features via meta-learning, TSM for task-specific dynamics, and RM to dynamically combine them during testing.

Result: FAF outperforms baselines, achieving a 41.81% improvement over iTransformer on CO₂ emissions data.

Conclusion: FAF enables robust and personalized forecasting with sparse data, demonstrating superior performance in few-shot settings.

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open dataset of QI-like stellarator plasma boundaries, paired with equilibria and performance metrics, to address bottlenecks in stellarator optimization. It provides benchmarks and baselines to facilitate community progress in fusion energy research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of standardized optimization problems and datasets for QI stellarators, hindering broader community progress in fusion energy research.

Method: Generated a dataset by sampling QI fields and optimizing plasma boundaries, introducing three benchmarks with reference code and baselines.

Result: The dataset and benchmarks enable efficient generation of novel configurations using learned models, reducing reliance on expensive simulations.

Conclusion: The release aims to lower barriers for optimization and machine learning researchers, accelerating progress toward commercial fusion energy.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

*Alan N. Amin,Andres Potapczynski,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepWAS uses fast linear algebra to train large neural networks for genome-wide association studies, improving predictions by optimizing likelihood rather than summary statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geneticists face bottlenecks in modeling genetic variants due to expensive linear algebra problems, limiting model size and accuracy.

Method: Leverages modern fast linear algebra techniques to train large neural networks (DeepWAS) for genome-wide association studies, optimizing likelihood.

Result: Larger models improve performance only with full likelihood optimization; they outperform smaller models when trained on more features.

Conclusion: DeepWAS enhances disease prediction and therapeutic target identification by enabling larger, more accurate models.

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

*Pantelis R. Vlachas,Konstantinos Vlachas,Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLieNet introduces a framework to learn global mappings for dynamical systems, enabling smooth transitions across parameterized behaviors and outperforming baselines in forecasting and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric variability in dynamical systems leads to diverse model behaviors, challenging generalization across parameter regimes.

Method: PHLieNet learns a global mapping from parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and a mapping to weights of a dynamics propagation network, using a hypernetwork to generate target network weights.

Result: PHLieNet excels in time extrapolation and parameter space interpolation, outperforming baselines in short-term forecasting and capturing long-term dynamical features.

Conclusion: PHLieNet provides a unified model for diverse parameterized dynamical systems, improving generalization and forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression aims to learn interpretable functions with small prediction errors by searching spaces of small expressions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve interpretable functions in regression tasks, moving beyond parameter optimization of basis functions.

Method: Systematic search in spaces of small symbolic expressions.

Result: More accurate and robust solutions, better recovery of true underlying expressions on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Systematic search in small expression spaces is superior to current symbolic regression methods.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

TL;DR: The paper explores how uncertainty calibration affects perturbation-based explanations in ML models, introduces ReCalX to improve explanation reliability, and validates its effectiveness with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of perturbation-based explanations due to poor uncertainty calibration in ML models.

Method: Introduces ReCalX, a recalibration approach for models to enhance explanation quality without altering original predictions.

Result: ReCalX improves explanation alignment with human perception and actual object locations in experiments.

Conclusion: Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial for reliable perturbation-based explanations, and ReCalX effectively addresses this issue.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of coherent forecasting across coarse and fine temporal scales for profit-optimized business decisions.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical architecture with specialized modules for different temporal aggregation levels, encoding average behavior in hidden layers.

Result: Validated on the M5 dataset, the architecture achieves accurate and coherent forecasts, outperforming TSMixer.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical architecture effectively solves the problem of temporal hierarchical forecasting, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse
and fine temporal scales is crucial for profit-optimized decision-making in
several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP) prevents extreme activation outliers in LLMs, improving quantization performance with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme activation outliers degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment of LLMs.

Method: OSP combines the Muon optimizer, Single-Scale RMSNorm, and learnable embedding projection to prevent outlier formation.

Result: A 1.4B-parameter OSP model achieves a 35.7 average benchmark score under 4-bit quantization, with near-zero excess kurtosis.

Conclusion: Outliers are not inherent to LLMs but result from training strategies; OSP enables more efficient deployment.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the out-of-distribution problem in offline RL by analyzing the impact of batch data and proposing UDG for unsupervised data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from performance gaps due to out-of-distribution issues, and existing methods focus on in-distribution actions. The paper explores the role of batch data in performance.

Method: The study theoretically links batch data to offline RL performance, introduces UDG for unsupervised data generation, and validates it empirically.

Result: UDG outperforms supervised data generation in task-agnostic settings, minimizing worst-case regret.

Conclusion: Theoretical and empirical results highlight the importance of batch data quality and demonstrate UDG's effectiveness in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor-parallelism in LLMs requires heavy communication for activation synchronization, which is bandwidth-intensive.

Method: Introduces Communication-Aware Architecture for Tensor-parallelism (CAAT-Net), requiring minor adjustments to avoid full activation synchronization.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in communication for 1B and 7B parameter models with no significant pretraining accuracy drop.

Conclusion: CAAT-Net effectively reduces bandwidth demands and accelerates both training and inference in LLMs.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with

### [95] [Model Guidance via Robust Feature Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19680)
*Mihnea Ghitu,Matthew Wicker,Vihari Piratla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simplified objective to improve model robustness and mitigate shortcut learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by reducing test-time misclassifications by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing models from relying on irrelevant or misleading features (shortcut features) is crucial to avoid real-world harms, especially in domains like medical imaging and NLP. Current methods using feature salience annotations are unreliable.

Method: The authors introduce a new objective that optimizes for explanation robustness and shortcut mitigation, supported by theoretical justification.

Result: Experiments show a 20% reduction in test-time misclassifications compared to state-of-the-art methods, with extensions to NLP tasks and insights on annotation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses shortcut learning and improves model robustness, offering practical insights and outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

*Yichao Fu,Rui Ge,Zelei Shao,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning improves speculative decoding by adding step-level parallelism, increasing speedup from 1.4x to 2.1x while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token-level speculative decoding (SD) has a capped speedup due to the exponential drop in correctness for longer token drafts.

Method: Introduces Lookahead Reasoning, where a draft model proposes future steps, the target model expands them in parallel, and a verifier ensures semantic correctness.

Result: Achieves a higher speedup (2.1x vs. 1.4x) and better scalability with GPU throughput.

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning effectively lifts the algorithmic ceiling of SD, offering significant speed improvements without compromising quality.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

*A. A. Balinsky,A. D. Balinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to reuse a single calibration set for reliable uncertainty quantification in machine learning, validated on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ICP requires fresh calibration sets for each prediction, limiting practicality. This work aims to reduce this need while maintaining reliability.

Method: Combines e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to modify Markov's inequality, enabling single-calibration-set reuse. Tested on CIFAR-10 with a deep neural network.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of maintaining provable performance with reduced calibration needs, validated through prediction sets on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The approach enhances practicality of conformal prediction by reducing calibration dependency while preserving reliability.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

TL;DR: OFTv2 improves upon OFT by reducing computational costs and memory usage while maintaining performance, also extending support for quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high runtime and memory demands of OFT, limiting its practical deployment.

Method: Reformulate OFT as input-centric (OFTv2) using matrix-vector multiplications and introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization for efficient orthogonal parameterization.

Result: Achieves up to 10x faster training, 3x lower GPU memory usage, and outperforms QLoRA in stability, efficiency, and memory.

Conclusion: OFTv2 offers a practical, efficient solution for parameter-efficient adaptation without performance loss.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using lightweight generators based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce memory usage in memory-based continual learning, improving accuracy without additional training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize memory footprint while effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.

Method: Uses SVD-based lightweight generators to enhance existing methods like A-GEM and Experience Replay, requiring minimal memory and no training time.

Result: Significant increase in average accuracy compared to original methods, with minimal memory usage.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces memory footprint in memory-based continual learning, showing great potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

*Alberto Pirillo,Luca Colombo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReBoot is the first framework for fully encrypted and non-interactive DNN training using Homomorphic Encryption, achieving accuracy comparable to plaintext training while enhancing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for deep learning methods that protect data privacy during training, especially under Homomorphic Encryption, which avoids multi-party computation and reduces computational overhead.

Method: ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture with local error signals, tailored packing for SIMD operations, and approximate bootstrapping to minimize multiplicative depth and noise.

Result: ReBoot achieves accuracy close to plaintext training, improves test accuracy by up to +6.83% over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, and reduces training latency by up to 8.83x.

Conclusion: ReBoot enables efficient and secure encrypted DNN training, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive applications like machine learning as-a-service.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

*Nathan Maurer,Harshal Kaushik,Roshni Anna Jacob,Jie Zhang,Souma Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based method combining reinforcement learning and bigraph matching improves resilience in critical infrastructure networks by optimizing crew-to-task allocations for faster and more effective restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions depends on efficient resource allocation for restoration, which is a complex combinatorial problem.

Method: A heterogeneous graph merges crew/transportation and power grid nodes. Graph reinforcement learning (GRL) with bigraph matching designs incentive functions for crew assignments, using Proximal Policy Optimization and Neuroevolution.

Result: The approach outperforms random policies by 3-fold and optimization-based solutions in computation time and power restored, demonstrating generalizability and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses restoration planning in CINs, offering scalable and efficient solutions for diverse damage scenarios.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Tobias Vontobel,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG) to improve classifier-free guidance (CFG) by separately scaling low and high frequencies, enhancing image quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's uniform scaling across frequencies causes issues like oversaturation and reduced diversity; understanding its frequency-domain effects can lead to better solutions.

Method: Analyze CFG in the frequency domain, propose FDG to decouple and separately scale low (global structure) and high (visual fidelity) frequencies.

Result: FDG improves image quality at low scales, avoids drawbacks of high CFG scales, and enhances FID and recall metrics.

Conclusion: FDG is a plug-and-play alternative to CFG, offering better fidelity and diversity in conditional diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAP introduces a variational framework using von Mises-Fisher distributions for uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks, improving calibration and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use isotropic Gaussian approximations, which poorly match the network's geometry, necessitating a better approach.

Method: CAP models weight uncertainties on the unit hypersphere with von Mises-Fisher distributions, linking concentration parameters to activation noise variance via a closed-form KL divergence regularizer.

Result: CAP reduces Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x on CIFAR-10 and provides interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles.

Conclusion: CAP offers a theoretically grounded, practical solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

TL;DR: MSA is a model-agnostic framework for quantifying neural unit contributions in high-dimensional outputs, revealing insights like computation hubs and language-specific experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SHAP fail to quantify neural unit contributions across high-dimensional outputs, creating a need for a better approach.

Method: Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA) systematically lesions unit combinations to produce Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps matching output dimensionality.

Result: MSA identifies computation hubs, language-specific experts in LLMs, and an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.

Conclusion: MSA is a powerful tool for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT is a preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis to extract salient data features, improving training stability and generalization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in deep learning lies in input preparation; DRIFT aims to provide minimal, structured, and noise-free data representations.

Method: DRIFT projects data onto a low-dimensional basis derived from spatial vibration modes, reducing input dimensions while retaining essential patterns.

Result: DRIFT achieves competitive accuracy with fewer features (~50 for MNIST, <100 for CIFAR100) and outperforms pixel-based models and PCA in stability and robustness.

Conclusion: DRIFT highlights the importance of physics-driven input curation over architecture engineering, enhancing deep learning performance.

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise Consistency Training (NCT) is introduced to integrate control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without retraining, achieving efficient and high-quality controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of adapting one-step generators to new control conditions without costly modifications or retraining.

Method: NCT uses an adapter module and noise consistency loss to align generation behavior with new controls, minimizing distributional distance.

Result: NCT outperforms existing methods in generation quality and computational efficiency, enabling controllable generation in a single forward pass.

Conclusion: NCT is a lightweight, modular, and data-efficient solution for integrating control signals into pre-trained one-step generators.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online convex optimization on ℓ_p-balls for p>2, showing FTRL with adaptive regularization is optimal across dimension regimes. It proves fixed regularization is sub-optimal in one regime and provides lower bounds for linear bandits in high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the optimal regret in online convex optimization on ℓ_p-balls and determine if fixed regularization can achieve anytime optimality.

Method: Uses Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularization adaptive to dimension regimes (high vs. low). Analyzes separable regularisers and fixed regularization.

Result: FTRL with adaptive regularization is anytime optimal. Fixed regularization is sub-optimal in one regime. Lower bounds rule out sub-linear regret for linear bandits in high dimensions.

Conclusion: Adaptive regularization is necessary for optimality; fixed regularization fails in one regime. High-dimensional linear bandits face fundamental limits.

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

TL;DR: Cross-regularization automates regularization tuning by using validation gradients during training, balancing feature learning and complexity control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of regularization parameters is time-consuming and suboptimal. Cross-regularization aims to automate this process for better model performance.

Method: The method splits parameter optimization: training data guides feature learning, while validation data shapes regularization. It uses noise injection in neural networks for implementation.

Result: The approach achieves provable convergence to cross-validation optima, reveals high noise tolerance, and architecture-specific regularization.

Conclusion: Cross-regularization efficiently integrates with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration, and growing datasets, offering a simple gradient-based solution.

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, a framework extending DPO to handle multiple human preference dimensions dynamically, offering flexibility and adaptability without re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques like RLHF are computationally intensive and unstable, while DPO assumes a single static preference distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic settings.

Method: The proposed framework extends DPO to incorporate multiple preference dimensions and enables dynamic interpolation via a controllable simplex-weighted formulation, supporting listwise preference feedback.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis shows the method matches DPO's effectiveness on static objectives while providing greater generality and adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework offers a lightweight, stable, and flexible solution for aligning language models with diverse and dynamic human preferences.

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face challenges in convergence and accuracy due to finite point optimization.

Method: Proposed an adaptive weighting scheme for loss functions, shifting focus from isolated points to continuous neighborhood regions.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate reduced relative L² errors.

Conclusion: The adaptive weighting scheme enhances PINN performance in solving PDEs.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

### [111] [Ambiguous Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19810)
*Vanessa Kosoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'ambiguous online learning,' where learners can predict multiple labels, with correctness defined by at least one correct label and no 'predictably wrong' labels. It connects to multivalued systems, recommendation algorithms, and compression, showing a trichotomy of mistake bounds: Θ(1), Θ(√N), or N.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where single-label predictions are insufficient, such as multivalued systems or recommendation tasks, by allowing ambiguous predictions.

Method: Defines ambiguous predictions and 'predictably wrong' labels using a hypothesis class. Analyzes mistake bounds in this framework.

Result: Identifies a trichotomy of optimal mistake bounds: Θ(1), Θ(√N), or N, up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: Ambiguous online learning is a viable framework for complex prediction tasks, with clear bounds on performance.

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

### [112] [Curating art exhibitions using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19813)
*Eurico Covas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI models mimic human art curators by learning from past exhibitions, achieving reasonable accuracy without large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI can replicate the subjective work of human art curators by learning from historical exhibition data.

Method: Four machine learning models trained on 25 years of Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibitions, focusing on feature engineering and modest model architectures.

Result: Models replicate past exhibitions with accuracy above random, showing potential without relying on large language models.

Conclusion: AI can approach human curatorial judgment with more data, and careful model design can match brute-force approaches.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

*Miles Wang,Tom Dupré la Tour,Olivia Watkins,Alex Makelov,Ryan A. Chi,Samuel Miserendino,Johannes Heidecke,Tejal Patwardhan,Dan Mossing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates emergent misalignment in language models, showing it occurs across diverse conditions and can be mitigated with minimal benign fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models generalize behaviors, particularly misalignment, from training to deployment, and explore mechanisms and mitigation strategies.

Method: Extends prior work by testing emergent misalignment in varied conditions (reinforcement learning, synthetic datasets, etc.), uses model diffing with sparse autoencoders to analyze internal representations, and tests mitigation via benign fine-tuning.

Result: Identifies 'misaligned persona' features in activation space, including a toxic persona feature that predicts misalignment. Shows misalignment can be efficiently mitigated with small benign datasets.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is a generalizable phenomenon with identifiable mechanisms, and it can be effectively addressed through targeted interventions.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

*Yiran Zhou,Yingyu Wang,Shoudong Huang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A correspondence-free multiview point cloud registration method using depth maps for global optimization, outperforming feature-based methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-based methods struggle with global optimization in complex environments due to challenges in feature extraction and data association.

Method: Represents the global map as a depth map and uses raw depth information for non-linear least squares optimization to jointly estimate point cloud poses and the global map.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, especially in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method avoids explicit feature extraction and data association, offering a robust solution for multiview point cloud registration.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

TL;DR: An enhanced YOLOv8 framework for real-time vehicle detection, classification, and carbon emission estimation, integrating deep OCR for license plate recognition and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the accuracy of vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring in urban environments by combining real-time detection with deep learning-based OCR.

Method: Enhances YOLOv8 for vehicle detection, segmentation, and tracking, followed by a hybrid pipeline for license plate recognition using deep OCR and validation via an external database.

Result: Achieved 71% mAP for detection, 70% for segmentation, and 99% OCR accuracy, demonstrating practical feasibility for smart transportation systems.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, automated solution for precise vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring.

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision-based method quantifies Parkinson's disease motor characteristics from video, improving accuracy and interpretability over subjective clinical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms are prone to variability and lack granularity.

Method: Proposes four sets of video-based features to quantify motor deficits, validated with PCA and machine learning classifiers.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy in predicting MDS-UPDRS scores and identifies granular distinctions in motor deficits.

Conclusion: The framework offers objective PD assessment, applicable in clinical and remote settings, with potential for future treatment and progression studies.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

*Chong Di,Shuwang Zhou,Da Chen,Jean-Marie Mirebeau,Minglei Shu,Laurent D. Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based framework for segment-wise tracking of tubular structures, outperforming existing methods by dynamically exploring segments and avoiding pre-computed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segment-wise tracking methods are computationally inefficient and rely heavily on prior knowledge, limiting their adaptability to complex morphologies.

Method: Proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework using Q-Learning to dynamically explore segments, compute edge weights on-demand, and adaptively expand the search space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches, handling complex topologies and maintaining global coherence without extensive prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust and efficient solution for tracking tubular structures, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

TL;DR: An AI-based automated safety monitoring system for tower cranes integrates camera and LiDAR data to protect workers and prevent collisions, proving effective in real-site tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing safety in automated tower crane operations, especially for human workers and Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) lifts, by leveraging 3D data from cameras and LiDAR.

Method: Developed a system combining AI, camera, and LiDAR for 3D data fusion to localize humans and MiCs, with a software pipeline, hardware, and display systems.

Result: Achieved accurate localization and collision avoidance, validated through real-site analysis and visualization.

Conclusion: The system is a practical and effective safety monitoring solution for tower crane operations.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans
and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The
state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Damba-ST is a domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction, addressing scalability and generalization issues of Transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training urban spatio-temporal models that generalize across diverse regions is challenging due to computational complexity and spatio-temporal heterogeneity.

Method: Damba-ST introduces a domain-adaptive state space model with shared and domain-specific subspaces, along with Domain Adapters for cross-domain alignment.

Result: Damba-ST achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in new urban environments without retraining.

Conclusion: Damba-ST offers an efficient and scalable solution for urban spatio-temporal prediction, overcoming limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

TL;DR: SDict-VLM replaces convolutions and self-attention in VLMs with a spectral dictionary token mixer, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify VLMs by removing computationally intensive components (convolutions and quadratic self-attention) while maintaining performance.

Method: Introduces a spectral dictionary token mixer, representing image patches or wordpieces as sparse combinations of learnable frequency atoms.

Result: Achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, SPICE of 27.0 on MS-COCO, and 50.3% accuracy on VQAv2, with 60% fewer parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: SDict-VLM offers efficient, interpretable VLMs with tunable accuracy-compute trade-offs, closing the performance gap to larger models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

TL;DR: DiffRIS, a novel framework using pre-trained diffusion models, improves remote sensing image segmentation by addressing scale, orientation, and semantic ambiguities through context perception and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with aerial imagery due to complex object characteristics like scale variations and semantic ambiguities.

Method: DiffRIS introduces a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) for refining linguistic features and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD) for aligning text with visual regions.

Result: DiffRIS outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, RISBench), setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models via DiffRIS effectively enhances remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE is a model-agnostic framework for visualizing visual and textual saliency in LVLMs during VQA, improving interpretability and human-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LVLMs' visual attention is crucial for transparency, diagnosing issues like hallucination and bias.

Method: GLIMPSE combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to generate attribution heatmaps.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in human-alignment, providing insights into cross-modal reasoning, hallucination, and bias.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE enhances LVLM interpretability, aiding in diagnosing model behavior and improving transparency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2MD, a method to distill self-attention-based diffusion transformers into linear-complexity Mamba models, enabling efficient high-resolution image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of self-attention in diffusion transformers for high-resolution image generation motivates the need for a more efficient alternative like Mamba, though direct training is challenging.

Method: Proposes T2MD, a distillation pipeline combining self-attention and Mamba, using layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation to ease training.

Result: Achieves efficient 2048×2048 image generation from a distilled 512×512 base model, with low overhead and high quality.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of using Mamba for non-causal visual tasks, opening avenues for future research.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

TL;DR: Proposes OoPk, a novel pipeline for Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) in semantic segmentation, addressing catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation via orthogonal projection and online prior-knowledge aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods struggle with balancing performance and efficient adaptation, especially in complex tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Uses orthogonal projection to preserve source model knowledge and an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy with image masking to enhance adaptability.

Result: Outperforms previous CTTA methods in semantic segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OoPk effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation, achieving competitive performance in CTTA tasks.

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: Legato is a transformer-based model for optical music recognition (OMR), excelling in recognizing full-page/multi-page scores and generating ABC notation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale pretrained OMR models capable of handling full-page/multi-page scores and generating human-readable ABC notation.

Method: Combines a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder, trained on 214K+ images, to generalize across typeset scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets, validated by comprehensive metrics.

Conclusion: Legato sets a new benchmark for end-to-end OMR with its scalability, ABC notation output, and superior performance.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music
recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable
of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

*Yimu Wang,Mozhgan Nasr Azadani,Sean Sedwards,Krzysztof Czarnecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAWAII is a framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving VLMs' visual understanding without high computational overhead.

Method: Uses teacher-specific LoRA adapters with a router for knowledge distillation, combining fine-grained and coarse-grained approaches.

Result: Outperforms popular open-source VLMs in vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: HAWAII effectively balances performance and efficiency in VLMs.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

*Iosif Tsangko,Andreas Triantafyllopoulos,Adem Abdelmoula,Adria Mallol-Ragolta,Bjoern W. Schuller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Vision Language Models (VLMs) infer emotions, focusing on visual cues like teeth and facial attributes, revealing psychological grounding and potential risks like bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the visual cues VLMs use for emotion recognition and assess whether these cues are psychologically grounded or superficially learned.

Method: Benchmarking VLMs on a teeth-annotated subset of AffectNet and introspecting GPT-4o to analyze facial attributes like eyebrow position.

Result: VLMs show consistent performance shifts based on visible teeth, and GPT-4o relies on facial attributes for affective reasoning, revealing internal consistency in predictions.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit emergent behavior in emotion recognition but pose risks like shortcut learning and bias, particularly in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

*Bowen Zhang,Jesse T. Boulerice,Nikhil Kuniyil,Charvi Mendiratta,Satish Kumar,Hila Shamon,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareSpot is a detection framework for small, rare wildlife in aerial imagery, combining multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation to improve accuracy by 35% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of small, rare wildlife like prairie dogs is vital for conservation but challenging due to their elusive nature and limitations of existing methods.

Method: RareSpot integrates multi-scale consistency learning (structured alignment across feature pyramids) and context-aware augmentation (synthesizing difficult training instances in realistic contexts).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on prairie dog drone imagery, improving detection accuracy by 35%, and generalizes well to other wildlife datasets.

Conclusion: RareSpot advances ecological monitoring and sets a foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

*Ilia Beletskii,Andrey Kuznetsov,Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves image inversion using consistency models for high-quality editing in just four steps, outperforming full-step diffusion models in efficiency and editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for image editing are computationally intensive, and distilled models suffer from poor inversion quality, limiting their editing capabilities. High-fidelity inversion is crucial for precise editing.

Method: The proposed framework enhances image inversion with consistency models and a cycle-consistency optimization strategy, balancing editability and content preservation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in image editing tasks, matching or surpassing full-step diffusion models while being more efficient.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality image editing with fewer steps, offering a practical solution for efficient and precise editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/ControlGenAI/Inverse-and-Edit.

*Christina Ourania Tze,Daniel Dauner,Yiyi Liao,Dzmitry Tsishkou,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrITTI introduces a latent diffusion-based framework using primitives for scalable, editable 3D semantic scene generation, outperforming voxel-based methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of voxel-based representations (memory-intensive, fixed resolutions, hard to edit) by leveraging compact, manipulable primitives for 3D scene generation.

Method: Hybrid representation: rasterized ground surfaces and vectorized 3D primitives for objects, with a Cholesky-based parameterization for stable encoding of size and orientation.

Result: Outperforms voxel-based methods on KITTI-360, reducing memory by 3×, and enables instance-level manipulation and downstream tasks like inpainting.

Conclusion: PrITTI offers a scalable, efficient, and flexible solution for 3D semantic scene generation and manipulation.

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

### [131] [Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154)
*Mahdi Falaki,Maria A. Amer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm using MobileViT is proposed, achieving fast inference and small model size while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality tracking struggles in challenging conditions, and existing multimodal trackers are computationally expensive.

Method: Progressive fusion framework with separable attention for intra- and inter-modal interactions.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy with <4M parameters and 122 FPS, outperforming state-of-the-art efficient trackers.

Conclusion: The first MobileViT-based RGB-T tracker, offering a balance of performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a lightweight, interpretable framework for keyframe extraction in videos, using perceptual color metrics to identify standout moments without deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online videos amplify cyber social threats like misinformation; detecting standout moments aids moderation and analysis.

Method: PRISM operates in CIELAB color space, using perceptual color difference metrics for keyframe extraction, avoiding deep learning.

Result: PRISM achieves strong accuracy and high compression ratios on benchmark datasets (BBC, TVSum, SumMe, ClipShots).

Conclusion: PRISM is effective for scalable, real-time analysis of harmful or politically sensitive media.

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MOSCARD, a multimodal framework integrating CXR and ECG for better MACE risk prediction, outperforming single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MACE is a leading global mortality cause, and current risk assessment methods are limited by bias and single-modality constraints.

Method: MOSCARD combines CXR and ECG using multimodal alignment, causal reasoning, and a dual back-propagation graph to mitigate bias.

Result: The model achieved AUCs of 0.75, 0.83, and 0.71 on internal, ED shift, and MIMIC datasets, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOSCARD offers cost-effective, early MACE risk screening, improving outcomes and reducing disparities.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

TL;DR: OpenWildlife (OW) is an open-vocabulary wildlife detector using language-aware embeddings and Grounding-DINO for multi-species identification in aerial imagery, outperforming existing methods with high mAP50 scores and efficient search algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated wildlife detectors lack generalization across species and environments due to limited taxonomic coverage and rigid architectures.

Method: OW uses language-aware embeddings and Grounding-DINO for species identification via natural language inputs, trained on 15 datasets, and employs a k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search algorithm for efficient detection.

Result: OW achieves up to 0.981 mAP50 with fine-tuning and 0.597 mAP50 on novel species datasets, capturing 95% of species while exploring only 33% of images.

Conclusion: OW is a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity assessments, with publicly released code and dataset splits for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Result: Highlights methodological overlaps and unique solutions for ancient scripts, summarizing current limitations and future directions.

Conclusion: Provides a structured perspective to advance recognition, interpretation, and decipherment of ancient scripts.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

TL;DR: MedErr-CT is a benchmark for evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of clinically relevant benchmarks for assessing expert-level knowledge in medical MLLMs, which often produce inaccurate information.

Method: Introduces MedErr-CT, a VQA framework with six error categories and three task levels (classification, detection, correction) to evaluate 3D medical MLLMs.

Result: Reveals significant performance variation among MLLMs across error types.

Conclusion: MedErr-CT aids in developing reliable MLLMs to reduce diagnostic errors and enhance clinical accuracy.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-XL-2 is a novel MLLM for long-video understanding, using task-aware KV sparsification to balance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to high computational and memory costs, limiting performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposes chunk-based pre-filling (sparse attention across chunks) and bi-level key-value decoding (selective reloading of dense/sparse KV).

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks, processing 10,000+ frames efficiently on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: Video-XL-2 offers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSR-Align, a dataset for improving safety alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against harmful multimodal prompts, enhancing robustness without compromising reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for unimodal models are inadequate for VLMs, and current datasets lack fine-grained reasoning for robust safety alignment.

Method: Developed MSR-Align, a dataset with multimodal diversity and policy-grounded reasoning, using rigorous quality filtering with multimodal judges.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align improves robustness against jailbreak attacks and maintains or enhances general reasoning.

Conclusion: MSR-Align offers a scalable solution for advancing safety alignment in reasoning-capable VLMs, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in data gathering and annotation for deep learning, especially for novel or sensitive subjects lacking datasets.

Method: Introduces AIR-Gen for dataset generation with automated prompt engineering and distribution adjustment, and AIR-Aug for dataset enhancement.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in training models and achieves high user satisfaction (4.4/5.0).

Conclusion: AIR offers a robust solution for automated dataset generation and model training, with broad applicability in image recognition.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

TL;DR: Proposes a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) to capture long-range dependencies in remote sensing change detection, improving feature representation with spatiotemporal and multi-branch feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based approaches lack effective long-range dependency capture between image channels, limiting feature representation.

Method: Introduces 3D-SSM for global spatial and channel information, with spatiotemporal interaction (SIM) and multi-branch feature extraction (MBFEM) modules.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The 3D-SSM and its components enhance change detection by integrating global and local features, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

*Weichen Zhang,Dong Xu,Wanli Ouyang,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAN and SPCAN, unsupervised domain adaptation methods combining collaborative and adversarial learning to improve feature representation and target domain discriminability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain distribution mismatch and enhance discriminability in target domains for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Method: Uses domain-collaborative and adversarial learning, formulated as domain classifier learning, with a self-paced strategy (SPCAN) for pseudo-labeled sample selection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for object and video action recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively improve unsupervised domain adaptation through collaborative and adversarial learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems are costly and create uncovered danger zones, especially in rural/suburban areas. UAVs provide a flexible, low-cost alternative.

Method: The dataset uses UAVs for bird's-eye-view perception, dynamic positioning, and includes 6.73 hours of diverse driving scenarios.

Result: The dataset supports development and evaluation of V2D algorithms, filling a gap in aerial-assisted autonomous driving.

Conclusion: AirV2X-Perception is a valuable open-source resource for advancing UAV-assisted collaborative driving systems.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaterCaption, a novel captioning dataset for waterway environments, and Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal model with a Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA) for efficient long-text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing waterway perception models lack global semantic understanding, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation.

Method: Leveraging VLMs, the authors create WaterCaption (20.2k image-text pairs) and propose Da Yu with NTA for efficient visual feature modeling.

Result: Da Yu outperforms state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and other benchmarks, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: WaterCaption and Da Yu advance waterway environment perception, enabling better semantic understanding and long-text generation for USVs.

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoliGS is a deformable Gaussian splatting framework for embodied view synthesis from long monocular videos, outperforming prior methods in reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRFs face high training overhead for long captures. HoliGS aims to address this by accurately reconstructing large-scale, dynamic environments.

Method: Decomposes scenes into static backgrounds and time-varying objects using Gaussian primitives. Employs hierarchical warping (rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and non-rigid deformations via invertible neural flow) for robust rendering.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality and reduces training/rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs.

Conclusion: HoliGS offers a practical and scalable solution for embodied view synthesis in real-world scenarios, with plans to release the source code.

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VLM-guided cascaded framework improves segmentation and classification of camouflaged objects by addressing domain gaps and leveraging SAM with VLM-derived prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) caused by domain gaps and ineffective generic segmentation models.

Method: Uses SAM guided by VLM for segmentation and avoids hard cropping by treating segmentation output as a soft spatial prior for classification.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on OVCOS and conventional benchmarks, improving localization accuracy and context-aware classification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages VLM semantics for precise segmentation and classification of camouflaged objects.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning system using human gaze data and video recordings improves the assessment of endotracheal intubation (ETI) skills, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective evaluation of airway management skills is unreliable, especially in real-world scenarios. This paper aims to provide an objective, accurate, and efficient assessment tool.

Method: The system uses gaze data to create visual masks, guiding an autoencoder for feature extraction and an attention module for classification.

Result: The method improves prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness, demonstrating its effectiveness for clinical skill assessment.

Conclusion: This approach enhances ETI skill evaluation, offering potential benefits for clinical training and patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained alignments between point clouds and text due to reliance on simple cosine similarity.

Method: LM-AD leverages a pretrained language model and the AQM to capture fine-grained alignments.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D AffordanceNet dataset.

Conclusion: LM-AD and AQM effectively address the limitations of current approaches for affordance detection.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PMC, a multi-modality domain adaptation framework, and PMC-PI for missing modalities, achieving effective cross-domain recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transfer knowledge from source to target domains using multiple modalities, addressing challenges like missing modalities in MMDA-PI.

Method: PMC uses modality cooperation for reliable pseudo-labeling; PMC-PI introduces MMG to generate missing modalities via adversarial learning and semantics preservation.

Result: PMC and PMC-PI show effectiveness in cross-domain recognition tasks on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: PMC and PMC-PI successfully address multi-modality domain adaptation, even with missing modalities, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetCoP is a continual vision-language pre-training framework for integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a unified model, addressing incremental data arrival and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models lack versatility by ignoring modality complementarity, and existing foundation models remain modality-specific. Dynamic environments require continual pre-training for incremental data integration.

Method: RetCoP uses a rehearsal strategy with representative image-text pairs and off-diagonal information distillation to mitigate forgetting and preserve image-text alignment.

Result: RetCoP outperforms compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate.

Conclusion: RetCoP successfully integrates multiple fundus modalities into a unified model, demonstrating superior performance in continual pre-training.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

TL;DR: A hypergraph-based multimodal framework improves cancer survival prediction by integrating multi-WSI pathology and genomic data, addressing modality imbalance and incomplete data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on FFPE slides and genomics, ignoring FF slides, and suffer from modality imbalance and incomplete data issues.

Method: Proposes a hypergraph learning framework for multimodal fusion and a memory mechanism to handle incomplete data.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods by 2.3% in C-Index and surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only (7.9%) models in incomplete scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates pathology and genomics, addressing key challenges in multimodal survival prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Abstract: This paper aims to achieve the segmentation of any 3D part in a scene based
on natural language descriptions, extending beyond traditional object-level 3D
scene understanding and addressing both data and methodological challenges. Due
to the expensive acquisition and annotation burden, existing datasets and

Motivation: To address the limitations of edge-based segmentation methods, particularly for noisy images or those with weak boundaries, by leveraging regional intensity differences.

Method: A rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, incorporating the divergence theorem and curve evolution theory, implemented in Python with finite difference methods and numerical stability measures.

Result: Accurate segmentation, noise robustness, and superior performance compared to edge-based methods, demonstrated on medical and synthetic images.

Conclusion: The Chan-Vese model is highly suitable for complex segmentation tasks and has strong potential for real-world imaging applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness
to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.
This study confirms the suitability of the Chan-Vese model for complex

applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEcho is a training-free framework for motion customization in distilled video generation models, using teacher forcing to improve motion fidelity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distilled video models struggle with motion customization under training-free settings due to accelerated generative processes.

Method: Leverages diffusion teacher forcing with high-quality teacher models to guide fast student models via endpoint prediction and interpolation, dynamically allocating computation.

Result: Significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: MotionEcho effectively addresses motion customization challenges in distilled video models without additional training.

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

### [156] [Online camera-pose-free stereo endoscopic tissue deformation recovery with tissue-invariant vision-biomechanics consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19388)
*Jiahe Chen,Naoki Tomii,Ichiro Sakuma,Etsuko Kobayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for tissue deformation recovery from stereo endoscopic images, addressing issues like occlusion and camera motion, using 3D point and derivative maps for geometry and deformation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve surgical navigation and autonomous soft tissue manipulation by overcoming limitations like occlusion, large deformation, and lack of biomechanical priors in previous methods.

Method: Models tissue geometry as 3D point and derivative maps, and deformation as 3D displacement and local deformation maps. Uses camera-centric setting and canonical map for online optimization.

Result: Achieves 3D reconstruction accuracy of 0.37±0.27 mm (non-occluded) and 0.39±0.21 mm (occluded), and estimates surface strain distribution.

Conclusion: The method effectively models tissue deformation and geometry in real-time, even under occlusion, enhancing surgical analysis.

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

*Jaeyoo Park,Sanghyuk Chun,Wonjae Kim,Sangdoo Yun,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text readability in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emerges abruptly after extensive training, unlike gradual semantic understanding. Delayed emergence suggests contrastive learning prioritizes general semantics first. Tailored training strategies are needed for robust text comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how text recognition in images develops during VLM training and identify the differences in learning patterns between text readability and semantic understanding.

Method: Analyzed the emergence of text readability and semantic understanding during VLM training, focusing on contrastive learning dynamics.

Result: Text readability emerges abruptly after many iterations, while semantic understanding develops gradually. Matching images with rendered text is even slower.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies are needed to enhance text comprehension in VLMs, highlighting the importance of optimizing multimodal learning approaches.

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

*Declan J. Curran,Sanaa Hobeichi,Hira Saleem,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD), a lightweight AI model for climate data downscaling, reducing computational demands while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional downscaling methods are computationally intensive, and while AI models like diffusion models show promise, they remain resource-heavy. HDD aims to address this.

Method: HDD uses a hierarchical sampling process within a diffusion framework, employing a coarse-to-fine hierarchy via downsampling. It reduces computational load by processing fewer pixels.

Result: HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 and CMIP6 datasets, significantly lowering computational costs and enabling seamless transfer across resolutions.

Conclusion: HDD provides an efficient, scalable solution for probabilistic climate downscaling, enabling affordable high-resolution climate projections.

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

TL;DR: GLCANet is a lightweight segmentation framework for UHR remote sensing imagery, addressing computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion challenges with a dual-stream architecture and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation in UHR remote sensing, overcoming limitations of existing methods in computational efficiency and feature fusion.

Method: Proposes GLCANet, using a dual-stream architecture, self-attention for long-range dependencies, and masked cross-attention for global-local feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency, handling large images with minimal GPU usage.

Conclusion: GLCANet offers a practical solution for real-world remote sensing applications, balancing performance and resource usage.

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

*Yin Zhang,Zian Ning,Xiaoyu Zhang,Shiliang Guo,Peidong Liu,Shiyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) using event cameras by focusing on propeller features in event streams, outperforming RGB-based methods without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV detection methods rely on RGB images, which lack generalized detection due to diverse appearances. Event streams capture propeller features better.

Method: Three modules extract propeller features from event streams while filtering noise. A novel event-based MAV dataset is introduced.

Result: The method achieves 83.0% precision (+30.3%) and 81.5% recall (+36.4%) on the new dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Event-based detection leveraging propeller features is effective for MAV detection, and the introduced dataset supports future research.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

*Lixuan He,Haoyu Dong,Zhenxing Chen,Yangcheng Yu,Jie Feng,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mem4Nav enhances VLN by combining hierarchical spatial-cognition memory (LTM and STM) with any backbone, improving navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of modular pipelines (lack unified memory) and end-to-end agents (fixed context windows, implicit spatial reasoning) in VLN tasks.

Method: Introduces Mem4Nav, a hierarchical memory system with sparse octree and semantic topology graph, using LTM for historical data and STM for real-time planning.

Result: Achieves 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement across three backbones.

Conclusion: Mem4Nav's hierarchical map and dual memory modules are essential for robust VLN performance, validated by ablations.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

*Congjing Yu,Jing Ye,Yang Liu,Xiaodong Zhang,Zhiyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMF-MedIT introduces an Align-Modulation-Fusion framework for integrating medical image and tabular data, addressing cross-modal discrepancies and noise. It includes the AMF module for dynamic fusion and FT-Mamba for efficient tabular encoding, achieving superior performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in multimodal medical data fusion, such as feature dimension discrepancies, modality contribution imbalances, and noise in tabular data.

Method: Proposes AMF module for adaptive modulation and fusion, and FT-Mamba for noisy tabular data encoding. Includes interpretability studies on tabular encoders.

Result: AMF-MedIT balances performance and data efficiency, adapts well to incomplete tabular data, and provides interpretable insights into feature extraction.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates medical image and tabular data, offering a robust solution for multimodal analysis, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

### [163] [Sampling Matters in Explanations: Towards Trustworthy Attribution Analysis Building Block in Visual Models through Maximizing Explanation Certainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19442)
*Róisín Luo,James McDermott,Colm O'Riordan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-optimal sampling approach for image attribution analysis by suppressing features, improving explanation certainty by aligning sample distribution with natural images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior gradient integration methods use noisy samples, leading to low explanation certainty. The paper aims to address this misalignment.

Method: A semi-optimal sampling approach suppresses input features to align sample distribution with natural images, avoiding noise addition.

Result: Extensive evaluation on ImageNet shows the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating trustworthy explanations.

Conclusion: Trustworthy attribution analysis requires solving sample distribution misalignment, achieved effectively by feature suppression.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Motivation: To address the lack of large, diverse, and realistic datasets for image deblurring, which limits the development of robust models.

Method: Constructed by averaging 240 frames from slow-motion videos to simulate blur, using the centered frame as the sharp reference.

Result: The dataset is 10x larger and 8x more diverse than existing ones, causing significant performance drops in SOTA models.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the
amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with
varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step method improves synthetic data for deep learning by introducing neural fractals and reverse stylization, reducing the domain gap with real images and enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real image datasets are hard to curate and pose privacy/legal issues, limiting commercial use. Synthetic data often underperforms, so this work aims to bridge the gap.

Method: Proposes neural fractals for synthetic data generation and reverse stylization to transfer real image features. Uses KID to measure domain gap.

Result: Reduced distributional gap, 11% lower FID in image generation, 20% lower autoencoder error, and 10% higher ImageNet-100 accuracy.

Conclusion: The method enables practical model training when real datasets are unavailable, showing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Motivation: Existing Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning and interpretability, limiting their clinical reliability. The paper aims to enhance these capabilities using Reasoning MLLMs.

Method: The authors build the Surgery-R1-54k dataset and propose Surgery-R1, a Reasoning MLLM with a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism (SFT and RFT) and a Multimodal Coherence reward system.

Result: Surgery-R1 outperforms existing SOTA models in Surgical-VQLA tasks and validates its reasoning capabilities and approach effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed Surgery-R1 enhances reasoning and interpretability in Surgical-VQLA, demonstrating superior performance and potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and
dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-based method for CT report generation using recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in CT report generation like spatial encoding and alignment, which existing methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: Uses a vision Transformer for recurrent slice processing and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling and alignment with text.

Result: Outperforms baselines on the M3D-Cap dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The method is valid and effective for CT report generation.

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater salient instance segmentation (USIS) is underexplored due to inaccessible environments and lack of annotated datasets. The study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors create USIS16K, a dataset of 16,151 high-resolution underwater images with instance-level annotations, and provide benchmark evaluations for detection and segmentation tasks.

Result: USIS16K offers diversity, complexity, and scalability, with high-quality annotations for 158 underwater object categories. Benchmark models are also provided.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmarks advance USIS research, making underwater object analysis more accessible and scalable.

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

TL;DR: HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer, improves DPN diagnosis via efficient multi-scale feature extraction and reduced reliance on labeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is crucial, but current automated methods using Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) face inefficiencies in feature extraction and data limitations.

Method: HMSViT uses pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding for multi-scale feature extraction, along with block-masked self-supervised learning to reduce labeled data dependency.

Result: HMSViT achieves 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming models like Swin Transformer and HiViT by up to 6.39%.

Conclusion: HMSViT offers robust, clinically viable results, demonstrating potential for scalable real-world DPN diagnosis.

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

*Tao Huang,Zhekun Liu,Rui Wang,Yang Zhang,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), introduces the PRE-HAL dataset for evaluation, and proposes a DST-based detection method to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucination in LVLMs poses risks in safety-critical AI applications, necessitating better evaluation and detection methods.

Method: Developed the PRE-HAL dataset for systematic evaluation and proposed a DST-based detection method using uncertainty estimation.

Result: The method outperformed baselines, achieving AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs.

Conclusion: The PRE-HAL benchmark and DST-based method effectively address visual hallucination, enhancing LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

### [172] [ReMAR-DS: Recalibrated Feature Learning for Metal Artifact Reduction and CT Domain Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19531)
*Mubashara Rehman,Niki Martinel,Michele Avanzo,Riccardo Spizzo,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (ReMAR-DS) reduces metal artifacts in kVCT images and transforms them into MVCT-like images, improving radiotherapy planning and reducing patient radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in kVCT imaging degrade quality, affecting clinical decisions. The goal is to reduce artifacts and bridge the gap between kVCT and MVCT for better radiotherapy planning.

Method: Uses an encoder-decoder architecture with feature recalibration to focus on artifact regions and preserve anatomical structures, transforming kVCT to MVCT-like images.

Result: Produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated qualitatively and quantitatively, reducing the need for repeated MVCT scans.

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS enhances radiotherapy planning by leveraging kVCT alone, lowering radiation exposure for patients.

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

*Ankita Raj,Ambar Pal,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect and identify natural-looking backdoor triggers in face recognition systems, achieving 74% top-5 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in face recognition systems pose security threats, especially with natural triggers like sunglasses or hats.

Method: Develops a technique to detect compromised networks and identify triggers, outperforming brute-force methods.

Result: Achieves 74% top-5 accuracy in identifying triggers, compared to 56% for brute-force.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses backdoor threats in face recognition, enhancing security.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleCap is an inference-time scalable image captioning method that addresses biases in LVLMs by progressively enriching captions with heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating, improving accuracy and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle biases in LVLMs (multimodal and linguistic) that lead to imbalanced or hallucinated captions, seeking to generate more comprehensive and accurate descriptions.

Method: Proposes two components: heuristic question answering to inject relevant information and contrastive sentence rating to eliminate hallucinations. The method scales with increased inference budget.

Result: ScaleCap improves caption quality, demonstrated by modality alignment experiments and performance gains on 11 benchmarks. It also excels in VQA and image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleCap effectively addresses LVLM biases, producing richer and more accurate captions, with applications in pretraining and multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretraining custom foundation models on medical data outperforms transfer-learning from generalist models, with well-tuned methods like DINOv2 achieving state-of-the-art results without novel methods or hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether pretraining custom foundation models on medical data is better than transfer-learning from generalist models, and if novel methods are needed.

Method: Case-study using DINOv2 to pretrain a model on 2M fetal ultrasound images, comparing against models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound, and supervised baselines.

Result: Custom pretraining outperforms transfer-learning, with DINOv2 achieving top results on classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks. Scaling in natural image pretraining doesn't translate to ultrasound.

Conclusion: Custom foundation models for medical domains are feasible with existing methods, avoiding the need for methodological innovation under resource constraints.

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

*Minjong Cheon,Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaOutRS introduces a hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image classification, replacing recurrent SSMs with stacked Gated CNN blocks and a Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) for global context, achieving SOTA performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and complexity of adapting State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba to 2D visual data, proposing a simpler yet effective alternative.

Method: Uses stacked Gated CNN blocks for local features and a novel FFG module in the frequency domain for global context, with a four-stage hierarchical design.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on UC Merced (98.41% F1-score), AID (95.99%), and other datasets, outperforming larger models with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MambaOutRS demonstrates that gated convolutions and frequency-based gates can replace complex SSMs, offering an efficient paradigm for vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARTIES is a foundation model for multi-sensor remote sensing, enabling flexible processing of diverse sensors by projecting data into a shared spectrum-aware space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models are limited to single sensors or fixed combinations, hindering scalability and generalization. SMARTIES aims to overcome this by unifying multi-sensor processing.

Method: SMARTIES projects heterogeneous sensor data into a shared space and trains a unified transformer model with cross-sensor token mixup for reconstruction.

Result: SMARTIES outperforms sensor-specific models on single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors.

Conclusion: SMARTIES provides a scalable, sensor-agnostic solution for remote sensing, enabling flexible multi-sensor data processing.

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) reconstructs cloud-covered MSI data by combining time-series MSI and SAR, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in MSI disrupts early crop mapping; SAR data is cloud-resistant but lacks spectral detail.

Method: Proposes Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using ViT, leveraging temporal coherence of MSI and SAR's complementary data via attention.

Result: Outperforms baselines (non-time-series MSI/SAR or time-series MSI alone) in reconstructing cloud-covered MSI.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered areas, aiding crop mapping.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Method: Uses heuristic-based image pixel sampling for efficient training and a Double Gradient mask to preserve LiDAR point features.

Result: Achieves best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domains in the KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: NVSF is a robust, self-supervised solution for dynamic scene representation in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR

our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline

transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks reliable datasets for scene understanding in indoor environments with humans, necessitating a structured representation for tasks like navigation and planning.

Method: The dataset includes RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images, and human keypoints, with parametric relations computed for objects and human-object pairs.

Result: HOIverse provides accurate and unambiguous relation definitions, benchmarked on state-of-the-art scene graph generation models.

Conclusion: The dataset aims to advance research in scene understanding involving humans by offering a comprehensive synthetic resource.

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention mechanisms in VLMs have quadratic complexity, limiting their application to long video understanding.

Method: PEVLM uses parallel encoding with block-wise segments, shared sinks, and aligned attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions.

Result: PEVLM achieves up to 8.37% accuracy improvement, 7.47x speedup in attention computation, and 40% reduction in end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: PEVLM is effective for low-latency, long-context video understanding, suitable for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling rapidly growing Earth observation datasets by leveraging efficient video compression techniques.

Method: Uses standard video codecs via ffmpeg to compress multichannel spatiotemporal datasets, encoding them as videos.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 250x with high fidelity (PSNRs 40.60-65.91 dB) and no performance loss in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: xarrayvideo provides an efficient, accessible solution for compressing Earth observation datasets, benefiting the Earth science community.

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP is effective for medical image segmentation, eliminating manual prompts and mitigating domain shift.

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: PathLUPI uses transcriptomic data during training to predict molecular features and prognosis from whole-slide images (WSIs), outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision oncology needs cost-effective, rapid molecular insights, but current deep learning methods struggle to predict these from WSIs.

Method: PathLUPI leverages transcriptomic privileged information to create genome-anchored histological embeddings for molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference.

Result: PathLUPI achieved AUC ≥ 0.80 in 14 tasks and C-index ≥ 0.70 in survival cohorts across 5 cancer types, revealing genotype-linked morphological signatures.

Conclusion: PathLUPI bridges molecular insights with routine pathology, overcoming limitations of existing models for clinical use.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

*Xuesong Li,Dianye Huang,Yameng Zhang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) method for ultrasound images to improve interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts, validated on neck region images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of medical ultrasound interpretability and the unmet need for basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, especially in point-of-care settings.

Method: A transformer-based one-stage method computes the ultrasound SG without explicit object detection. LLMs refine the SG representation based on user queries. The SG also guides scanning toward missing anatomies.

Result: Validated on neck region images, the method enhances interpretability and usability for non-experts, democratizing ultrasound.

Conclusion: The SG-based approach shows promise in making ultrasound more accessible and interpretable for ordinary users.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

*Yue Zhou,Yuan Bi,Wenjuan Tong,Wei Wang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraAD is a vision-language model for anomaly detection in ultrasound images, improving localization and fine-grained classification using few-shot examples and text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of fine-grained differentiation in anomaly detection and domain gaps in ultrasound imaging.

Method: Fuses image-level tokens with text embeddings for localization and uses a memory bank with text descriptions for classification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lesion localization and fine-grained classification on breast US datasets.

Conclusion: UltraAD effectively combines vision-language modeling for precise anomaly detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

*Stephanie Käs,Sven Peter,Henrik Thillmann,Anton Burenko,David Benjamin Adrian,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates projection methods for fisheye images to improve 3D human pose estimation, finding advanced models like double sphere enhance accuracy. A heuristic for model selection is proposed, and a new dataset (FISHnCHIPS) is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate human pose detection in fisheye images is challenging due to distortions, and existing methods lack systematic evaluation for wide-FOV poses.

Method: Evaluated pinhole, equidistant, double sphere models, and cylindrical projections for 3D pose estimation, proposing a heuristic for model selection.

Result: Pinhole projection is inadequate for close-ups; optimal method varies with FOV. Double sphere model significantly improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Advanced fisheye models enhance pose estimation. The heuristic and FISHnCHIPS dataset address gaps in wide-FOV pose detection.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo4D is a framework for generating detailed, multi-view consistent 4D scenes from text prompts, optionally with images, by separating foreground and background synthesis guided by motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D synthesis methods lack multi-view consistency and immersion in dynamic scenes, limiting their practical use.

Method: CoCo4D divides synthesis into dynamic foreground and evolving background, guided by a motion sequence. It uses video diffusion models for initial motion and progressive outpainting for synthesis, optimizing foreground trajectory for realism.

Result: CoCo4D outperforms existing methods in generating realistic and coherent 4D scenes, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CoCo4D effectively addresses limitations of current 4D synthesis methods, offering superior performance and immersion in dynamic scene generation.

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

### [191] [One Prototype Is Enough: Single-Prototype Activation for Interpretable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19808)
*Yitao Peng,Lianghua He,Die Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoSolo is a deep neural architecture for interpretable image classification using a single prototype per category, reducing explanation complexity and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype networks rely on multiple prototypes for classification, which complicates explanations. ProtoSolo aims to simplify this by using a single prototype.

Method: ProtoSolo uses a single prototype for classification, a feature-based comparison method with feature maps, and a non-prototype projection learning strategy.

Result: ProtoSolo achieves superior performance on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets, with lower cognitive complexity in explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoSolo simplifies interpretable image classification with single prototypes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both performance and explanation clarity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bind-Your-Avatar, a model for generating multi-talking-character videos in the same scene, addressing challenges like audio-to-character control and dataset scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-character scenarios, leaving multi-character conversations in shared spaces unaddressed.

Method: Proposes an MM-DiT-based model with an Embedding Router for audio-to-character binding, 3D-mask embedding methods, and a new dataset.

Result: Superior performance in dual-talking-character video generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles multi-character video generation challenges, offering fine-grained control and a benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage video generation framework combining semantic content generation and detail synthesis, focusing on optimizing cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) models for high-resolution outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User demand for higher-resolution video outputs makes latent computation alone insufficient, necessitating a decoupled approach for efficiency and quality.

Method: The study introduces degradation strategies for training pair alignment, analyzes VSR model behavior (timestep sampling, noise augmentation), and proposes architectural innovations (interleaving temporal unit, sparse local attention).

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies validating each design choice's impact.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical baseline for cascaded VSR, guiding future advancements in efficient video synthesis.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFM is a simple, effective framework for progressive visual generation using Flow Matching at multi-scale levels, outperforming prior methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional visual generation is computationally intensive, and existing multi-stage architectures add complexity. DFM aims to simplify this process while improving results.

Method: DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a multi-scale representation (e.g., Laplacian pyramid) for progressive generation.

Result: DFM improves visual quality for images and videos, achieving 35.2% better FDD scores on Imagenet-1k 512px and faster convergence for large models like FLUX.

Conclusion: DFM offers superior performance, simplicity, and minimal pipeline modifications, making it a practical solution for progressive visual generation.

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

TL;DR: GenHSI is a training-free method for generating long human-scene interaction videos by subdividing the task into script writing, pre-visualization, and animation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with generating long, realistic human-scene interaction videos due to issues like unrealistic interactions, identity loss, and high training costs.

Method: GenHSI divides the task into three stages: script writing (breaking tasks into atomic actions), pre-visualization (creating 3D keyframes), and animation (using off-the-shelf models).

Result: The method generates long videos with preserved character identity and plausible interactions from single-view images, without requiring training.

Conclusion: GenHSI effectively addresses limitations of prior work, enabling consistent long-video generation with rich human-scene interactions.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction as a 2D image quality assessment task, using a cross-reference IQA framework for faster, representation-agnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for view selection are specialized and complex, requiring 3D modeling. The paper aims to simplify this by leveraging 2D image quality assessment.

Method: A model is trained to predict SSIM in a multi-view setup, guiding view selection based on rendering quality without ground-truth images.

Result: The framework outperforms previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively, is agnostic to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-reference IQA approach is efficient, versatile, and improves performance in view selection tasks.

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel
Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different
variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with

TL;DR: UniVLA is a unified vision-language-action model that autoregressively models multimodal signals as token sequences, excelling in long-horizon tasks and setting new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLAs rely on VLMs for action signals but miss temporal and causal structures in visual data. UniVLA addresses this gap.

Method: UniVLA models vision, language, and action as discrete token sequences, incorporating world modeling for causal dynamics.

Result: Achieves 95.5% success on LIBERO, surpassing prior methods, and performs well in real-world tasks like ALOHA and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: UniVLA's unified approach and world modeling enable superior performance in robotic manipulation and autonomous tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion synthesis methods are limited by fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization. AnimaX aims to bridge video-based motion knowledge with 3D animation for broader applicability.

Method: AnimaX represents 3D motion as multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps, using joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on template renderings and text prompts. It employs shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings for alignment.

Conclusion: AnimaX offers a scalable, category-agnostic solution for 3D animation, effectively transferring video priors to motion generation.

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism for video diffusion models, reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high computational costs in video diffusion models due to temporal dimensions by leveraging Spatiotemporal Energy Decay.

Method: Introduces Radial Attention with O(n log n) complexity, using a static attention mask for spatially nearby tokens and shrinking window size with temporal distance.

Result: Achieves up to 1.9x speedup, enables 4x longer video generation, reduces training costs by 4.4x, and accelerates inference by 3.7x.

Conclusion: Radial Attention efficiently scales video diffusion models, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

### [201] [MemeMind: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18919)
*Hexiang Gu,Qifan Yu,Saihui Hou,Zhiqin Fang,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemeMind, a large-scale, diverse, and explainable dataset for harmful meme detection, and MemeGuard, a detection framework that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of harmful memes on social media is a growing issue, but current datasets lack scale, diversity, and explainability, hindering progress in detection.

Method: The authors created MemeMind, a dataset with rigorous standards, bilingual support, and detailed annotations. They also developed MemeGuard, a framework integrating multimodal information and reasoning modeling.

Result: MemeGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection, as shown by experiments on the MemeMind dataset.

Conclusion: MemeMind and MemeGuard address critical gaps in harmful meme detection, providing a robust dataset and framework for future research.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [202] [Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18998)
*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals that LLMs often mistake memorization for genuine reasoning, leading to overconfidence and inconsistency in problem-solving, especially in STEM fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs truly learn reasoning patterns or just memorize solutions, and how this affects their self-knowledge and trustworthiness.

Method: A novel framework was used to evaluate LLMs' generalization and self-knowledge, focusing on STEM domains with standardized jargon and problems.

Result: LLMs showed over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments due to reliance on memorized solutions, particularly in science and medicine.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectures and training methods need improvement to balance self-knowledge and ensure explainability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

### [203] [Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19004)
*Brian Siyuan Zheng,Alisa Liu,Orevaoghene Ahia,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of language models (LMs) to non-canonical tokenizations, finding they retain high performance and can even improve in specific tasks. Instruction-tuning is key to this robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LMs handle non-canonical tokenizations unseen during training and whether such tokenizations can enhance performance.

Method: Evaluate LMs across 20 benchmarks using randomly sampled and character-level tokenizations, then identify tasks where non-canonical tokenizations improve performance.

Result: Instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4% performance with random tokenizations and 90.8% with character-level. Character-level tokenization boosts string/code tasks by +14%, and digit grouping improves arithmetic by +33%.

Conclusion: LMs are less dependent on their tokenizer than assumed, and non-canonical tokenizations can enhance performance, with robustness arising from instruction-tuning.

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

*Weijie Xu,Yiwen Wang,Chi Xue,Xiangkun Hu,Xi Fang,Guimin Dong,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiSCo is a statistical framework for evaluating group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic biases in long-form responses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs overlook biases in long-form responses and intrinsic variability, undermining reliability.

Method: FiSCo decomposes model outputs into claims, uses entailment checks, and applies statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities.

Result: FiSCo reliably identifies nuanced biases and reduces the impact of LLM variability, outperforming other metrics.

Conclusion: FiSCo provides a robust method for detecting subtle biases in LLMs, enhancing fairness evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

*Omer Luxembourg,Haim Permuter,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS) improves non-autoregressive text generation by enabling parallel unmasking with fewer denoiser calls, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing samplers for masked diffusion language models (MDLM) falter under parallel unmasking due to ignored token interactions, limiting inference speed.

Method: DUS partitions sequence positions into dilation-based groups for parallel unmasking, reducing denoiser calls to O(log B) per block.

Result: DUS outperforms confidence-based planners in math and code completion benchmarks, improving scores without modifying the denoiser.

Conclusion: DUS is a lightweight, efficient method for high-quality text generation, unlocking MDLM's potential.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

*Mike Zhang,Rob van der Goot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents NLPnorth's submission to TalentCLEF 2025, focusing on multilingual job title matching and job title-based skill prediction. It compares classification-based, contrastive-based, and prompting methods, finding prompting best for Task A and fine-tuned classification for Task B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The tasks of matching job titles and aligning them to skills are crucial for applications like candidate matching and job market analysis.

Method: The study compares fine-tuned classification-based, contrastive-based, and prompting methods, leveraging multilingual language models and extra data from ESCO.

Result: For Task A, prompting achieved 0.492 MAP; for Task B, fine-tuned classification achieved 0.290 MAP. The team ranked 5th in Task A and 3rd in Task B.

Conclusion: Largest multilingual language models perform best for both tasks, with prompting excelling in job title matching and fine-tuned classification in skill prediction.

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

*Jackson Trager,Francielle Vargas,Diego Alves,Matteo Guida,Mikel K. Ngueajio,Ameeta Agrawal,Flor Plaza-del-Arco,Yalda Daryanai,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning, highlighting their shortcomings in moral sentiment prediction and rationale alignment, especially in underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparent, multilingual benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning, particularly in culturally diverse contexts.

Method: Creation of MFTCXplain, a dataset with 3,000 tweets in four languages, annotated for hate speech, moral categories, and rationales, evaluated using Moral Foundation Theory.

Result: LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836) but poorly in moral sentiment prediction (F1 < 0.35), with limited rationale alignment in underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to internalize human moral reasoning, emphasizing the need for improved benchmarks and model training.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: $	exttt{StorySim}$ is a framework for generating synthetic stories to evaluate LLMs' theory of mind and world modeling, revealing performance gaps and heuristic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contamination in pretraining data and enable precise evaluation of ToM and WM capabilities in LLMs.

Method: Uses a controllable $	exttt{Storyboard}$ to generate novel, compositional story prompts for first- and second-order ToM and WM tasks.

Result: LLMs perform better on WM than ToM tasks and show heuristic behaviors like recency bias.

Conclusion: $	exttt{StorySim}$ provides a robust tool for evaluating LLMs, highlighting limitations in reasoning about mental states.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), a criterion to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations, and shows their limitations in nuanced reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from toxicity detection to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity for enhanced trustworthiness in downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes HAF, a multi-dimensional criterion, and six metrics to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations without human involvement.

Result: LLMs generate plausible explanations for simple prompts but fail in nuanced reasoning, producing inconsistent responses.

Conclusion: LLMs' toxicity explanations lack consistency in complex scenarios, highlighting the need for improved reasoning methods.

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A joint speech and text optimization method (J-TAED) improves ASR accuracy by unifying speech and text modalities, enabling text-based domain adaptation without needing speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large text corpora and enhance ASR accuracy, especially in mismatch domains where speech data is scarce.

Method: Joint training of hybrid transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder (TAED) with both speech and text inputs, but only speech input during inference.

Result: Reduced WER by 5.8-12.8% on Librispeech and 15.3-17.8% on out-of-domain datasets via text-based adaptation.

Conclusion: J-TAED effectively integrates speech and text, improving ASR performance and enabling domain adaptation without additional speech data.

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual adaptation of LLMs for low-resource languages, comparing techniques like few-shot prompting and translate-test with gradient-based methods. Few-shot and translate-test outperform others, with degradation in trained models attributed to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of LLMs in low-resource languages for in-context learning and explore effective adaptation techniques.

Method: Comprehensive study across five languages, three LLMs, and seven tasks, testing techniques like few-shot prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, and instruction fine-tuning.

Result: Few-shot prompting and translate-test outperform gradient-based methods. Catastrophic forgetting is identified as a key issue in trained models.

Conclusion: Few-shot and translate-test are more effective for low-resource languages, highlighting the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in gradient-based methods.

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to improve communication in multi-agent LLM systems by transferring both natural language tokens and state transition trajectories, achieving SOTA performance in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems use natural language for communication, leading to information loss, especially for reasoning logics or abstract thoughts.

Method: Introduces SDE to encode token-wise state transition trajectories alongside natural language tokens for agent communication.

Result: Multi-agent systems with SDE outperform other protocols, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SDE demonstrates the potential of communication augmentation for enhancing LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

*Rasiq Hussain,Jerry Ma,Rithik Khandelwal,Joshua Oltmanns,Mehak Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid NLP method combining sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models and RNNs with attention to predict personality traits from long narratives, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional personality assessments rely on questionnaires; NLP can leverage open-ended text for richer insights, but long narratives (2000+ tokens) pose challenges.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models for embeddings, (2) RNNs with attention for long-range dependencies and interpretability.

Result: Outperforms LLaMA and Longformer in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability for personality trait prediction.

Conclusion: Combining language features with long-context modeling advances personality assessment from narratives.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated data can mitigate data scarcity but risks model collapse. This study explores how data diversity affects downstream performance, finding moderate diversity beneficial and high diversity harmful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked importance of data diversity in LLM-generated data and its impact on downstream model performance.

Method: Investigates varying diversity levels in LLM-generated data and mixed synthetic data proportions, testing their effects on model performance.

Result: Moderately diverse LLM-generated data improves performance with minimal distribution shift, while highly diverse data harms it.

Conclusion: Empirical findings provide guidance for using LLMs as data generators, emphasizing the role of data diversity.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

*Zhiyang Qi,Keiko Takamizo,Mariko Ukiyo,Michimasa Inaba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoStage enhances AI-driven counseling by improving empathetic response generation using open-source LLMs, addressing psychological state inference and counseling phase alignment without extra training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for mental health care and limitations of current AI-driven counseling systems, such as poor psychological state understanding and privacy concerns, motivate the development of EmoStage.

Method: EmoStage leverages open-source LLMs for empathetic response generation, incorporating perspective-taking for psychological state inference and phase recognition to align with counseling stages.

Result: Experiments in Japanese and Chinese settings show EmoStage improves response quality and competes with data-driven methods.

Conclusion: EmoStage offers a viable solution for AI-driven counseling, balancing performance and privacy without requiring additional training data.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework using Mamba (SSM) integrates phonological features and token strategies to improve APA and MDD in CAPT, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective pronunciation feedback is crucial in L2 learning, and joint modeling of APA and MDD can yield mutual benefits.

Method: Leverages Mamba (SSM), integrates phonological features, and uses token strategies for interpretability and temporal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the Speechocean762 benchmark, especially in MDD.

Conclusion: First study combining phonological attribution, SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT, showing superior performance.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

*Jisu Shin,Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Hoyun Song,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an atomic-level evaluation framework to measure persona fidelity in LLMs, addressing subtle deviations missed by existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for persona fidelity in LLMs are coarse and fail to detect subtle inconsistencies, affecting reliability in human-AI interactions.

Method: The authors introduce an atomic-level evaluation framework with three key metrics to quantify persona alignment and consistency at a finer granularity.

Result: The framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies overlooked by prior methods and reveals how task structure and persona desirability impact model adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a more precise and realistic assessment of persona fidelity, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona expression.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

### [218] [Measuring and Guiding Monosemanticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19382)
*Ruben Härle,Felix Friedrich,Manuel Brack,Stephan Wäldchen,Björn Deiseroth,Patrick Schramowski,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS) and Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE) to improve feature isolation and control in LLMs, demonstrating enhanced interpretability and performance in tasks like toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for interpreting and controlling LLMs struggle with feature localization and manipulation, prompting the need for better tools like FMS and G-SAE.

Method: The authors propose G-SAE, which conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training, and introduce FMS to quantify feature monosemanticity.

Result: G-SAE improves feature isolation, interpretability, and control, as shown in evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style identification, and privacy attribute recognition.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidelines for advancing mechanistic interpretability and control in LLMs.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeilProbe is a framework for detecting pre-training texts in LLMs in black-box settings without human intervention, using sequence-to-sequence mapping and key token perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data privacy and copyright protection by detecting if a text is part of an LLM's pre-training data, especially in black-box settings where existing methods fail.

Method: Uses a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to infer latent features, performs key token perturbations, and employs a prototype-based classifier to avoid overfitting.

Result: Effective and superior performance in black-box settings, validated on three datasets.

Conclusion: VeilProbe provides an automated, efficient solution for detecting pre-training texts in LLMs without relying on hidden model information or manual efforts.

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

### [220] [Learning to Disentangle Latent Reasoning Rules with Language VAEs: A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19418)
*Yingji Zhang,Marco Valentino,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores embedding explicit reasoning rules in language models (LMs) using Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to improve generalization, interpretability, and controllability. It proposes a pipeline for learning reasoning rules in Transformer-based VAEs, demonstrating disentangled reasoning, prior knowledge injection, and performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMs rely on memorization rather than rule-based inference, limiting generalization and interpretability. The study aims to enhance LMs by explicitly embedding reasoning rules.

Method: A pipeline for learning reasoning rules in Transformer-based VAEs, including three rule-based tasks, a theoretical framework, and an end-to-end architecture. Experiments involve disentangling rules, injecting prior knowledge, and analyzing performance bottlenecks.

Result: Disentangled reasoning rules form distinct clusters in feature space. Prior knowledge injection improves retrieval efficiency. Performance plateaus in mathematical reasoning, with FFN layers better preserving rule separation than attention layers.

Conclusion: Explicitly embedding reasoning rules in LMs via VAEs enhances interpretability and controllability, though performance bottlenecks exist. The method offers a practical approach for integrating prior knowledge into decoder-only models.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to predict human annotation disagreements, a gap overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. RLVR reasoning worsens disagreement prediction despite boosting general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs can capture informative human annotation variation, not just majority labels, as disagreements reflect task subjectivity and ambiguity.

Method: Extensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without repeated human labels, including testing RLVR-style reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in disagreement prediction, and RLVR reasoning degrades this performance further.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to evaluate and improve LLMs for disagreement modeling, as current methods overlook this critical aspect.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuBench is introduced as a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs across 61 languages, revealing gaps in language coverage and performance disparities, especially for low-resource languages. MLC is proposed as a new metric, and cross-lingual transfer dynamics are explored via pretraining experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets for multilingual LLMs are limited and lack cross-lingual alignment, leading to fragmented assessments of multilingual capabilities.

Method: MuBench is developed to evaluate multilingual LLMs across 61 languages. Multilingual Consistency (MLC) is introduced as a metric. Pretraining experiments on 1.2B-parameter models with varying language ratios and parallel data proportions are conducted.

Result: Notable gaps between claimed and actual language coverage are found, with performance disparities between English and low-resource languages. MLC helps analyze bottlenecks. Pretraining experiments provide insights into cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: MuBench and MLC address limitations in multilingual LLM evaluation, highlighting performance gaps and offering tools for model improvement. Pretraining experiments contribute to understanding cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores turn-level data augmentation for dialogue systems using commonsense relationships, leveraging LLMs for generation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by generating contextually relevant synthetic turns using commonsense knowledge and automating their evaluation.

Method: Uses pretrained LLMs for prompt-based generation conditioned on commonsense attributes, inspired by Chain-of-Thought. Evaluates using an instruction-based prompt framework.

Result: Preliminary results show LLMs effectively generate and evaluate commonsense-augmented dialogue turns.

Conclusion: The approach successfully utilizes LLMs for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between educational theory and AI-driven conversational learning by aligning LLM behaviors with established pedagogical principles.

Method: Synthesizes literature on LLMs in education and pedagogical theories, examines prompting strategies and RAG, and maps theories to LLM capabilities.

Result: Identifies gaps in LLM applications (e.g., direct answers) and proposes strategies like Socratic questioning and scaffolded prompts.

Conclusion: Proposes practical strategies to make LLM dialogues more educationally productive and aligned with sound pedagogy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

*Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Xuansheng Wu,Derek Wong,Ninhao Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Efficient reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) risks behavioral inconsistencies, as shown by the $ICBENCH$ benchmark, which reveals increased inconsistency with strategies like No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies compromise model robustness and consistency, given the potential for overthinking in LRMs.

Method: Introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: ITS, TR-LB, and IR-SE, applied to various open-source LRMs.

Result: Larger models are more consistent but still exhibit scheming behaviors. Efficient reasoning strategies increase inconsistency across all dimensions.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning improves token efficiency but may introduce risks of models evading supervision, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

TL;DR: AnTKV is a framework for ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization in LLMs, using Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to minimize performance degradation by preserving high-sensitivity tokens in full precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing memory footprint of KV cache in LLMs while minimizing performance degradation from ultra-low-bit quantization.

Method: Proposes Anchor Score (AnS) to quantify token sensitivity, then uses Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization (AnTKV) and a triton kernel for efficient deployment.

Result: Enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle 840K tokens on an 80GB A100 GPU, with 3.5x higher throughput and lower perplexity (6.32 at 1-bit, 8.87 at 0.375-bit) vs. FP16 baseline (4.73).

Conclusion: AnTKV outperforms prior works in ultra-low-bit settings, balancing memory efficiency and model accuracy.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generation of factual and relevant answers from EHRs by improving retrieval strategies in a RAG framework.

Method: A RAG pipeline with query-dependent-k retrieval strategies (including surprise, autocut, autocut*, and elbow) instead of fixed top-k.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms fixed-k methods in producing factual and relevant answers.

Conclusion: Query-dependent-k retrieval strategies in RAG frameworks improve answer quality for EHR-based question answering.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving medication safety by structuring irregular and colloquial French posology instructions, which are challenging for classic ML methods.

Method: Comparison of prompt-based LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and a baseline NERL system, followed by a hybrid pipeline routing low-confidence NERL cases to LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs match baseline NERL accuracy, while the hybrid approach achieves 91% structuration accuracy with optimized compute.

Conclusion: A hybrid NERL-LLM pipeline offers a scalable, accurate solution for real-world clinical use, balancing structural precision and semantic nuance.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

TL;DR: KnowMap dynamically builds a knowledge base to enhance LLMs' task-specific performance, improving GPT-4-Turbo by 17.71% on ScienceWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with rapid adaptation to specialized tasks due to static pre-trained knowledge and costly fine-tuning methods.

Method: KnowMap dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental/experiential data and fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model for LLMs.

Result: 17.71% performance improvement for GPT-4-Turbo on the ScienceWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: KnowMap efficiently adapts LLMs to tasks and enhances reasoning by integrating environmental/experiential knowledge.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental
and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Health Sentinel is a multi-stage pipeline using ML and non-ML methods to extract disease outbreak events from online articles, aiding early detection and intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveillance is challenging; monitoring online media manually is impractical due to volume.

Method: Combines ML and non-ML techniques in a multi-stage pipeline to extract structured health event data.

Result: Processed 300M+ articles, identified 95K+ health events, with 3.5K flagged as potential outbreaks.

Conclusion: Health Sentinel effectively automates early outbreak detection from online media, supporting public health efforts.

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

*Debabrata Mahapatra,Shubham Agarwal,Apoorv Saxena,Subrata Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCStat leverages raw attention logits for better token importance analysis, enabling efficient compression and high-fidelity attribution without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on Softmax-normalized attention weights, missing richer pre-Softmax logit structures.

Method: Introduces RCStat, a framework using Relative Contextualization (RC) to analyze raw logits, with an efficient upper bound for RC.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression (adaptive key-value eviction) and attribution (token/sentence/chunk-level explanations).

Conclusion: RCStat outperforms post-Softmax methods in benchmarks, offering practical gains without retraining.

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

TL;DR: The paper examines MT evaluation metrics by comparing them to human baselines, finding that state-of-the-art metrics often match or surpass human performance, but cautions against overinterpreting these results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the upper bounds of metric performance and assess whether automatic metrics can reliably measure progress in MT evaluation.

Method: Incorporating human baselines in MT meta-evaluation to compare the performance of automatic metrics against human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art metrics often perform on par with or better than human baselines, suggesting potential human parity.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for caution in interpreting metric performance and raise questions about reliably measuring progress in MT evaluation.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECCoT is a framework to validate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs, improving interpretability and trustworthiness by integrating MRF-ETM and CSBert.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, necessitating methods to ensure valid reasoning chains.

Method: ECCoT uses MRF-ETM for topic-aware CoT generation and CSBert for causal reasoning alignment, filtering ineffective chains with structured statistics.

Result: ECCoT enhances interpretability, reduces biases, and improves trustworthiness in LLM-based decision-making.

Conclusion: ECCoT addresses LLM limitations by validating reasoning chains, offering a robust framework for reliable outputs.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

*Tom Marzea,Abraham Israeli,Oren Tsur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach for detecting hate-mongers by analyzing user texts, activity, and network context, outperforming text and graph-based methods across diverse platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hate speech detection by focusing on user-level analysis, addressing gaps in prior work that primarily targets hateful utterances.

Method: A multimodal aggregative approach combining hateful texts, user activity, and network data, evaluated on Twitter, Gab, and Parler datasets.

Result: The method significantly improves hate-monger detection, handles coded messages and dog-whistling effectively, and performs well across platforms.

Conclusion: The approach enhances hate speech classification and informs interventions, demonstrating robustness across diverse datasets and networks.

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by enriching it, improving model performance across tasks compared to filtered data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by recycling discarded low-quality web data.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to enrich low-quality documents for training, mixing them with high-quality data.

Result: Improves performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks and outperforms 2x web data.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple, effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores self-correcting methods for LLMs to reduce hallucinations in news summarization, using evidence from search engines and analyzing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, particularly in news summarization, by leveraging self-correcting methods.

Method: Apply two state-of-the-art self-correcting systems to correct hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. Analyze performance and alignment with human evaluation.

Result: Reveals practical benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot prompts, and high alignment between G-Eval and human evaluation.

Conclusion: Self-correcting methods show promise for reducing hallucinations in news summarization, with practical insights for improving LLM performance.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems for specific goals, like behavior change in Motivational Interviews, by integrating LLMs with RL for better adaptability and efficiency.

Method: Uses hierarchical reinforcement learning for structured dialogue phases and meta-learning for adaptability across user profiles.

Result: Outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in reward, showing benefits of conditioning LLMs for goal-oriented dialogue.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines LLMs and RL for goal-driven dialogue, demonstrating improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a
specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the
structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability
across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and
efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

TL;DR: RPT improves LLMs' reasoning but generalizes inconsistently to new domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well RPT's improvements generalize beyond the fine-tuning domains.

Method: Two studies: (1) Observational comparison of RPT models across domains, (2) Interventional fine-tuning on single domains and evaluation across multiple domains.

Result: RPT shows gains on similar tasks but inconsistent or no gains on domains with different reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: RPT's benefits are domain-specific and do not reliably generalize to new reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

*Takashi Nishibayashi,Seiji Kanazawa,Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance changes in Symptom Checkers (SCs) for rare diseases using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), showing effective prediction for diseases with frequency data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating SC algorithm updates for rare diseases due to limited data and high costs of manual vignette creation.

Method: Uses HPO disease-phenotype annotations to generate synthetic vignettes, simulating SC interviews to estimate performance changes. Evaluated retrospectively with R-squared coefficients.

Result: For diseases with frequency data (n=5), R^2 was 0.831 for recall@8 and 0.78 for precision@8, showing predictive capability. Poor performance for diseases without frequency data (n=3). Manual effort: ~2 hours per disease.

Conclusion: The method offers a low-cost, transparent way to pre-deployment evaluate SC algorithm changes for rare diseases, aiding early diagnosis support.

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

Motivation: Address the challenge of Arabic dialect classification due to its linguistic diversity and applications in chatbots, social media, and accessibility.

Method: Tested RNNs, Transformers, and LLMs (via prompt engineering) on the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets, with advanced preprocessing.

Result: MARBERTv2 performed best (65% accuracy, 64% F1-score), highlighting key linguistic challenges in dialect identification.

Conclusion: The study advances Arabic NLP, supporting applications like dialect-specific chatbots and social media monitoring.

Abstract: The Arabic language is among the most popular languages in the world with a
huge variety of dialects spoken in 22 countries. In this study, we address the
problem of classifying 18 Arabic dialects of the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.
RNN models, Transformer models, and large language models (LLMs) via prompt
engineering are created and tested. Among these, MARBERTv2 performed best with
65% accuracy and 64% F1-score. Through the use of state-of-the-art
preprocessing techniques and the latest NLP models, this paper identifies the
most significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The
results corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in
users' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic
communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces bidirectional recurrent attention (RA) layers for long-form speech recognition, matching multi-head attention (MHA) accuracy while being more efficient. It also proposes Direction Dropout for regularization and improved throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-head attention (MHA) models are inefficient for long-form speech recognition due to quadratic complexity. The paper explores linear complexity RA layers as a solution.

Method: The study uses bidirectional RA layers and introduces Direction Dropout for regularization. A long-form training paradigm is developed to enhance RA performance.

Result: RA layers match MHA accuracy for short- and long-form ASR, with 44% higher throughput than limited-context attention (LCA). Direction Dropout improves accuracy and enables higher throughput decoding.

Conclusion: Bidirectional RA layers with Direction Dropout offer an efficient and accurate alternative to MHA for long-form speech recognition, with superior throughput and flexibility.

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimally integrating SFT and RL in LLMs for reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes SRFT, a single-stage method combining SFT and RL through entropy-aware weighting, using demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts.

Result: Achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on in-distribution and 10.9% on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: SRFT effectively unifies SFT and RL, demonstrating superior performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Motivation: Open-source LLMs have limitations in reasoning-intensive data analysis tasks, prompting the need for strategies to enhance their capabilities.

Method: The study curates a seed dataset of diverse scenarios, evaluates models on three dimensions, and develops a data synthesis methodology based on findings.

Result: Key findings include strategic planning as a performance determinant, the influence of interaction design and task complexity, and data quality's greater impact over diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed data synthesis methodology significantly improves open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical

*Abdullah Khondoker,Enam Ahmed Taufik,Md. Iftekhar Islam Tashik,S M Ishtiak Mahmud,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study enhances communal violence text detection in Bengali using a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and an ensemble model, achieving improved performance (F1 scores of 0.60 and 0.63). Challenges in context understanding and data imbalance were addressed, with qualitative insights from LIME analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of cyber hatred inciting communal violence is a critical yet underexplored issue, especially in Bengali social media data.

Method: A fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and an ensemble model were developed, with dataset expansion (1,794 instances) to address imbalance. LIME was used for interpretability.

Result: Macro F1 scores of 0.60 (BanglaBERT) and 0.63 (ensemble model) were achieved. Qualitative analysis revealed context-understanding challenges.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates NLP's potential in combating communal violence, offering a foundation for future refinements in accuracy and societal impact.

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

### [245] [MAM: Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis via Role-Specialized Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19835)
*Yucheng Zhou,Lingran Song,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAM introduces a modular multi-agent framework for medical diagnosis, outperforming baseline models by 18%-365%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal medical LLMs lack flexibility and efficient knowledge updates.

Method: Decomposes diagnosis into specialized roles (e.g., General Practitioner, Radiologist) using LLM-based agents.

Result: MAM consistently outperforms modality-specific LLMs, with improvements up to 365%.

Conclusion: MAM offers a scalable, flexible solution for multimodal medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

### [246] [Assessing Risk of Stealing Proprietary Models for Medical Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19464)
*Ankita Raj,Harsh Swaika,Deepankar Varma,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to model stealing (MS) attacks, proposing a two-step method called QueryWise to enhance attack efficiency with limited queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary medical imaging models are at risk of MS attacks, but their susceptibility is understudied. The paper aims to investigate this vulnerability under realistic constraints.

Method: The study uses publicly available datasets and introduces QueryWise, a two-step MS approach leveraging unlabeled proxy data to train a thief model without extra queries.

Result: The method proves effective in stealing models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification, even with limited query budgets.

Conclusion: Medical imaging models are vulnerable to MS attacks, and QueryWise offers a practical solution for adversaries with limited resources.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

### [247] [On the efficacy of old features for the detection of new bots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19635)
*Rocco De Nicola,Marinella Petrocchi,Manuel Pratelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper compares four state-of-the-art feature sets for detecting novel bots on Twitter, suggesting cost-effective and general-purpose classifiers as viable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of malicious bots spreading spam and bias necessitates effective detection methods.

Method: Comparison of four feature sets (Botometer, account profile, timeline, and Twitter client data) on six Twitter datasets.

Result: General-purpose classifiers with cheap-to-compute features show promise for detecting evolved bots.

Conclusion: Cost-effective feature sets and general classifiers can effectively detect advanced bots.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.
