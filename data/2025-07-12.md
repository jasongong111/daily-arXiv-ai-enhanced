### [1] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified agentic framework using LLMs combines symbolic reasoning and adaptive control for chemical processes, achieving high success in fault recovery and continuous control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing workforce shortages and complex fault scenarios in chemical processes by integrating symbolic reasoning with adaptive control.

Method: Uses LLMs within a framework with FSMs for planning, a Simulation Agent for execution, and a Validator-Reprompting loop for refinement.

Result: Achieves 100% valid-path success in fault recovery and comparable performance to PID control in continuous process modulation.

Conclusion: LLMs with structured feedback can unify symbolic planning and continuous control, enhancing automation resilience in chemical engineering.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

### [2] [BOOST: Out-of-Distribution-Informed Adaptive Sampling for Bias Mitigation in Stylistic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07134)
*Mridula Vijendran,Shuang Chen,Jingjing Deng,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in AI for painting classification, proposing BOOST, a method to mitigate bias by dynamically adjusting sampling and scaling, evaluated on KaoKore and PACS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in AI for art classification, from imbalanced datasets, compromises fairness and accuracy, especially for rare styles. Prior work overlooks bias in OOD data.

Method: Proposes BOOST, an OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method, adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities for equitable class representation.

Result: BOOST balances performance and fairness, reducing class-wise bias, validated on KaoKore and PACS datasets with the new SODC metric.

Conclusion: BOOST is a robust solution for unbiased AI in art classification, ensuring fairness without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) improves rule-governed trading in games by decomposing trading into states, ensuring high compliance and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with rule violations in trading systems, undermining player trust.

Method: SIBP uses autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule adherence, decomposing trading into six states with item referencing and placeholder-based calculations.

Result: Evaluation shows >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7% calculation precision, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SIBP provides a reliable foundation for trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

### [4] [Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217)
*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores neurosymbolic methods to detect illicit activities in supply chains using sparse, unreliable data, comparing manual and automated feature extraction from news articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illicit activities in supply chains are hard to detect due to sparse, corrupted data. Traditional ML requires large datasets, which are unavailable here.

Method: Uses neurosymbolic methods and a question tree approach with LLMs to classify news articles on forced labor, comparing human and machine performance.

Result: Proposes a systematic way to evaluate article relevance and differences between human and machine classification.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic methods and LLMs can effectively detect illicit activities in supply chains despite data limitations.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

TL;DR: A multi-agent system (cmbagent) with 30 LLM agents automates scientific research tasks using a Planning & Control strategy, achieving PhD-level results in cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate complex scientific research tasks without human intervention by leveraging specialized LLM agents.

Method: Uses 30 LLM agents with specialized roles (retrieval, coding, interpretation, critique) and a Planning & Control workflow, executing code locally.

Result: Successfully performed a PhD-level cosmology task, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs on benchmarks.

Conclusion: cmbagent demonstrates effective automation of scientific research, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient exploration is challenging in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and expert exploration is a promising approach to address this.

Method: The study investigates applying large-language models as expert planners for exploration in planning-based multi-agent tasks.

Result: The work demonstrates the potential of large-language models to enhance exploration efficiency in multi-agent settings.

Conclusion: Large-language models can effectively serve as expert planners for efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning
and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the
intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to
efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent
operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

### [7] [ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306)
*Yichen Lu,Wei Dai,Jiaen Liu,Ching Wing Kwok,Zongheng Wu,Xudong Xiao,Ao Sun,Sheng Fu,Jianyuan Zhan,Yian Wang,Takatomo Saito,Sicheng Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViDove is a multimodal translation agent that improves translation quality by leveraging visual and contextual information, outperforming text-only models with significant BLEU and SubER score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based translation agents are limited to text-only inputs, lacking the ability to utilize visual and contextual cues like human translators.

Method: ViDove integrates a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules with domain-specific knowledge, inspired by human translation workflows.

Result: ViDove achieves a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and 15% in SubER, excelling in subtitle generation and general translation tasks.

Conclusion: ViDove demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal inputs in translation, introducing DoveBench as a new benchmark for video subtitling and translation.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

### [8] [On the Impossibility of Separating Intelligence from Judgment: The Computational Intractability of Filtering for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07341)
*Sarah Ball,Greg Gluch,Shafi Goldwasser,Frauke Kreuter,Omer Reingold,Guy N. Rothblum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights computational challenges in filtering harmful content in LLMs, showing that external filters for inputs and outputs are ineffective, and argues that alignment requires integrating judgment into the AI's intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of LLMs for generating harmful content raises concerns, prompting the study of alignment challenges and the effectiveness of filtering mechanisms.

Method: The study examines prompt and output filtering, demonstrating computational intractability under cryptographic assumptions, and explores relaxed mitigation approaches.

Result: Efficient prompt filters are impossible for certain LLMs, and output filtering is computationally intractable in natural settings.

Conclusion: Safety cannot rely on external filters; alignment must integrate judgment into the AI's intelligence, requiring more than black-box access.

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

### [9] [Supply Chain Optimization via Generative Simulation and Iterative Decision Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07355)
*Haoyue Bai,Haoyu Wang,Nanxu Gong,Xinyuan Wang,Wangyang Ying,Haifeng Chen,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sim-to-Dec, an integrated framework combining simulation and decision-making to optimize supply chain transportation, improving delivery rates and profit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high responsiveness and economic efficiency in supply chain transportation by providing a robust, generalizable simulation-decision framework.

Method: Sim-to-Dec includes a generative simulation module using autoregressive modeling and a dual-aware decision model refined through end-to-end optimization.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements in timely delivery rates and profit.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec effectively meets the requirements for a robust and efficient transportation strategy framework.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

*Zerui Yang,Yuwei Wan,Yinqiao Li,Yudai Matsuda,Tong Xie,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DrugMCTS integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing, outperforming existing methods without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with reasoning beyond pretrained knowledge, and conventional methods like fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation have computational or data exploitation limitations.

Method: DrugMCTS combines RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search, using five specialized agents for structured reasoning on molecular and protein data.

Result: DrugMCTS outperforms Deepseek-R1 by over 20% and shows higher recall and robustness on DrugBank and KIBA datasets compared to general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning, agent collaboration, and feedback-driven search are key to advancing LLM applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

*Weihao Tan,Changjiu Jiang,Yu Duan,Mingcong Lei,Jiageng Li,Yitian Hong,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo is a benchmark for AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations, evaluating skills like farming, crafting, and social interactions, with GPT-4.1 achieving only a 12.7% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack simultaneous evaluation of production and social skills in AI agents, prompting the creation of StarDojo.

Method: StarDojo features 1,000 tasks across five domains (farming, crafting, exploration, combat, social interactions) and a subset of 100 tasks for efficient evaluation. It uses a unified interface supporting parallel execution.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs, like GPT-4.1, perform poorly (12.7% success rate), struggling with visual understanding and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: StarDojo aims to advance research in robust, open-ended agents for complex production-living environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

*Oliver Eberle,Thomas McGee,Hamza Giaffar,Taylor Webb,Ida Momennejad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlgEval, a framework to study the algorithms LLMs learn and use, aiming to bridge the gap in understanding emergent algorithms through systematic evaluation of latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research prioritizes performance scaling over understanding the algorithms LLMs employ, creating a theoretical and empirical gap. AlgEval seeks to address this by uncovering algorithmic primitives and their composition.

Method: AlgEval combines top-down hypothesis formation about candidate algorithms with bottom-up circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states.

Result: The framework is demonstrated through a case study on emergent search algorithms, illustrating its potential to reveal how LLMs solve tasks.

Conclusion: AlgEval offers a principled approach to understanding LLM computations, enabling interpretability and potentially leading to more efficient training methods and novel architectures.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

*Mohamed Siala,Jordi Planes,Joao Marques-Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the rigor of explanations in rule-based ML models, highlighting issues like negative overlap and redundancy, and develops algorithms to analyze these problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for accurate explanations in high-risk ML applications, as incorrect explanations can mislead decision-makers.

Method: Develops algorithms to analyze undesired facets (e.g., negative overlap, redundancy) in rule-based ML models.

Result: Finds that widely used tools for learning rule-based models often produce rule sets with negative facets.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of rigorous analysis to ensure reliable explanations in rule-based ML models.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

*Zhixiang Su,Di Wang,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Pooling, a novel method to enhance GNN-based models for link prediction in KGs, achieving SOTA performance in most settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla aggregation in GNNs for KG link prediction lacks significant impact, prompting the need for improved methods like Context Pooling.

Method: Context Pooling applies graph pooling in KGs and generates query-specific graphs for inductive settings, using neighborhood precision and recall metrics.

Result: Applied to two SOTA models on three datasets, the method achieved SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: Context Pooling is effective and generic, enhancing GNN-based models for KG link prediction, especially in inductive scenarios.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

*Fedor Rodionov,Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Michael Birsak,John Femiani,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanQA is a benchmark for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in LLMs, revealing their limitations in handling real-world layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' ability to reason about geometric and spatial properties in structured indoor scenes.

Method: Uses symbolic representations (e.g., JSON, XML) of indoor scenes and diverse question types to test metric, topological, and design-related reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform well on shallow queries but struggle with physical constraints, spatial coherence, and generalization under layout changes.

Conclusion: PlanQA highlights a critical gap in LLMs' spatial reasoning, urging further research to enhance their practical applicability.

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

### [18] [Stable Preference Optimization for LLMs: A Bilevel Approach Beyond Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07723)
*Chengtao Jian,Kai Yang,Ye Ouyang,Xiaozhou Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing its sensitivity to initialization and tendency to misallocate probability mass, leading to unintended biases. A new bilevel optimization framework, stable preference optimization, is proposed to address these issues, improving alignment and reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored theoretical properties and limitations of DPO, particularly its sensitivity to initialization and misallocation of probability mass, which can reinforce biases and compromise alignment stability.

Method: The authors propose a bilevel optimization framework integrating supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective, introducing regularization to ensure absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs while maintaining stable dynamics.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method improves reasoning accuracy and aligns output distributions better with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO.

Conclusion: Stable preference optimization offers a more reliable and interpretable approach to language model alignment, addressing DPO's limitations and opening new research avenues.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

### [19] [Identification of Violin Reduction via Contour Lines Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07743)
*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to classify violins as reduced or non-reduced based on contour lines, using 3D geometric meshes and mathematical modeling, finding some success in distinguishing the two types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to quantitatively analyze the impact of size reductions on violins' contour lines, a feature observed by experts but not previously studied systematically.

Method: The method involves analyzing 25 violins' 3D meshes, extracting contour lines, fitting them with parabola-like curves, and using classification techniques to predict size reduction.

Result: Classification based on geometry is feasible to some extent, with the opening parameter (beta) being the most predictive, though challenges remain for violins with intermediate transformations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of geometric analysis for classifying reduced violins, highlighting the importance of the opening parameter while acknowledging limitations for intermediate cases.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

*Elizabeth Hilliard,Akshaya Jagadeesh,Alex Cook,Steele Billings,Nicholas Skytland,Alicia Llewellyn,Jackson Paull,Nathan Paull,Nolan Kurylo,Keatra Nesbitt,Robert Gruenewald,Anthony Jantzi,Omar Chavez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The FAI Benchmark evaluates AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions, revealing gaps in current models, especially in Faith, Character, and Meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift AI evaluation from technical capabilities to holistic human well-being, ensuring AI supports flourishing.

Method: Uses 1,229 questions, specialized judge LLMs, and geometric mean scoring to assess alignment across seven dimensions.

Result: Top models scored 72/100, but none excelled in all dimensions, highlighting weaknesses in Faith, Character, and Meaning.

Conclusion: The FAI Benchmark provides a framework for developing AI that actively supports human flourishing, advancing ethical AI development.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

*Lu Xu,Jiaqian Yu,Xiongfeng Peng,Yiwei Chen,Weiming Li,Jaewook Yoo,Sunghyun Chunag,Dongwook Lee,Daehyun Ji,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoSE, a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model for autonomous driving, mimicking human learning and reasoning processes to improve performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extensive training data and complex optimization in general MoE models by leveraging human-like skill-by-skill and step-by-step learning.

Method: Proposes a skill-oriented routing mechanism, hierarchical skill dataset, and pretrains the router to align with human reasoning and driving tasks.

Result: MoSE outperforms larger models (8B+ parameters) on CODA AD corner case reasoning with less than 3B sparsely activated parameters and reduces activated model size by at least 62.5%.

Conclusion: MoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in autonomous driving with computational efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of human-inspired skill-oriented learning.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

### [22] [AI Should Sense Better, Not Just Scale Bigger: Adaptive Sensing as a Paradigm Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07820)
*Eunsu Baek,Keondo Park,Jeonggil Ko,Min-hwan Oh,Taesik Gong,Hyung-Sin Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for adaptive sensing in AI to reduce environmental and ethical costs, showing smaller models can outperform larger ones with this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI scaling incurs high costs and lacks sustainability. Biological sensory systems inspire adaptive sensing as a solution.

Method: Proposes adaptive sensing by modulating sensor parameters at the input level to improve efficiency and robustness.

Result: Empirical evidence shows adaptive sensing enables small models to outperform larger ones with less data and compute.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a roadmap for integrating adaptive sensing, addressing challenges, and promoting sustainable, equitable AI.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

### [23] [Searching for actual causes: Approximate algorithms with adjustable precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07857)
*Samuel Reyd,Ada Diaconescu,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in explainable AI (XAI) by proposing polynomial-complexity algorithms to identify actual causes, catering to non-expert users and diverse system types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical XAI and causality literature fail to meet non-expert users' expectations for explanations, focusing instead on factor-consequence relationships. Formalizing and identifying actual causes remains challenging and NP-complete.

Method: The authors introduce algorithms with polynomial complexity to approximate actual causes, adjustable for precision and exhaustiveness.

Result: Experiments show the algorithms handle non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems, with trade-offs between precision, exhaustiveness, and computation time.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms offer a practical solution to identify actual causes, bridging the gap between expert and non-expert needs in XAI.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

### [24] [An Integrated Framework of Prompt Engineering and Multidimensional Knowledge Graphs for Legal Dispute Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07893)
*Mingda Zhang,Na Zhao,Jianglong Qing,Qing xu,Kaiwen Pan,Ting luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining prompt engineering and multidimensional knowledge graphs to enhance large language models for legal dispute analysis, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack sufficient legal knowledge representation, concept understanding, and reasoning abilities, limiting their effectiveness in legal analysis.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure, legal-specific reasoning templates, dynamic optimization, and a three-layer knowledge graph with four retrieval methods.

Result: Experiments show improved legal dispute analysis, accurate legal application, and nuanced understanding of judicial logic.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel approach for intelligent legal assistance systems, addressing key limitations of current models.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to convergence in AI model capabilities, making meek models competitive with top-tier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inequality in AI model performance due to compute scaling by a few companies and predicting a future where smaller models catch up.

Method: Develops a model showing shrinking marginal returns to compute under fixed-distribution objectives, supported by empirical data and theoretical analysis.

Result: Diminishing returns imply that even exponential scaling offers little long-term advantage, and meek models will approach top performance.

Conclusion: AI strategy and policy need reevaluation due to the predicted convergence, impacting future AI development and deployment.

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

*Kiran Tomlinson,Sonia Jaffe,Will Wang,Scott Counts,Siddharth Suri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how generative AI impacts work activities, identifying common tasks like information gathering and writing, and measures AI's applicability across occupations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the economic effects of generative AI by examining its role in work activities and occupational impact.

Method: Analysis of 200k anonymized user interactions with Microsoft Bing Copilot, classifying activities and measuring task success and scope.

Result: Highest AI applicability in knowledge work occupations like computer/mathematical and office support, with successful tasks involving information and communication.

Conclusion: Generative AI is most applicable to knowledge-based and information-driven occupations, with implications for wage and education correlations.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constructive approach to scaling LLMs using fixed embeddings, enabling modular composition and layer-wise growth, improving efficiency and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive and inflexible nature of monolithic LLM training by exploring alternative, scalable methods.

Method: Uses non-trainable, deterministic embeddings as a universal docking port for modular composition (merging specialist models via logit averaging) and progressive layer-wise growth (stacking layers incrementally).

Result: Merged MoE models outperform constituent experts without forgetting, and layer-wise growth shows stable convergence and depth-correlated reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The approach shifts AI development towards incremental complexity and modularity, offering resource-efficient scaling and democratization of powerful AI systems.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

*François Gardères,Shizhe Chen,Camille-Sovanneary Gauthier,Jean Ponce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FACap, a large-scale fashion-domain dataset for composed image retrieval (CIR), and FashionBLIP-2, a fine-tuned model for improved performance in fashion-specific CIR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods struggle with fashion domains due to lack of fine-grained understanding and large annotated datasets.

Method: FACap is automatically constructed using web-sourced images and a two-stage annotation pipeline with VLM and LLM. FashionBLIP-2 fine-tunes BLIP-2 with lightweight adapters and multi-head matching.

Result: FashionBLIP-2 significantly improves performance on fashion CIR tasks, especially for fine-grained modifications.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the value of domain-specific datasets and models in challenging environments like e-commerce.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Henry Kvinge,Timothy Doster,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autoeval-dmun is an automated tool using vision-language models to assess unlearning in diffusion models, identifying nearby concept damage and adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning (MU) is cost-effective but lacks reliable verification of complete information removal and risks damaging retained concepts.

Method: Leverages vision-language models to extract structured knowledge, identify nearby concepts affected by MU, and test adversarial prompts.

Result: Language models provide semantic orderings correlating with unlearning damage and effectively circumvent MU with adversarial prompts.

Conclusion: Autoeval-dmun offers a robust automated solution for evaluating and improving MU in diffusion models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP introduces a GNN-based framework combining node encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths for improved link prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with link-specific structural patterns due to node-centric message-passing, and existing methods are either costly or simplistic.

Method: SP4LP uses GNNs for node representations, extracts shortest paths between node pairs, and processes them with a sequence model.

Result: SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction benchmarks and is proven more expressive than standard GNNs.

Conclusion: SP4LP is a general, efficient, and principled approach for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores sparse adapters as modular architecture building blocks, proposing a simple training method that outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning. Merging adapters for 20 NLP tasks shows superior in-distribution performance but challenges in held-out performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build modular architectures for rapid task adaptation without fine-tuning, leveraging sparse adapters as an alternative to LoRA.

Method: Proposes a simple method for training sparse adapters and investigates their merging properties across 20 NLP tasks.

Result: Sparse adapters outperform LoRA and full fine-tuning in-distribution but struggle with held-out performance.

Conclusion: Sparse adapters are effective modular building blocks but require further research for robust generalization.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

*Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Xiaobao Wang,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Str-GCL integrates structural commonsense into Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) using first-order logic rules, improving representation learning without altering the graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCL methods overlook structural commonsense in graphs, missing crucial knowledge for effective representation learning.

Method: Str-GCL uses first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense, integrating them into GCL via topological and attribute-based rules and a representation alignment mechanism.

Result: Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, demonstrating the value of structural commonsense in graph representation learning.

Conclusion: Str-GCL successfully addresses the gap in GCL by explicitly incorporating structural commonsense, offering a new perspective for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

*Karthik Pappu,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using hybrid physics-informed models (UDEs) for malware propagation modeling, outperforming traditional and neural methods by 44% in accuracy while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of malware propagation is crucial for cybersecurity, especially against adaptive threats. Existing methods often miss nonlinear feedback mechanisms in real-world networks.

Method: The study evaluates three approaches: classical ODEs, UDEs, and Neural ODEs, using data from the Code Red worm outbreak. A symbolic recovery method transforms neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions.

Result: UDEs reduce prediction error by 44% compared to baselines, revealing suppression mechanisms like network saturation and security response.

Conclusion: Hybrid physics-informed models outperform purely analytical or neural approaches, offering better predictive accuracy and insights for cybersecurity strategies.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

*Zhaojing Zhou,Xunchao Li,Minghao Li,Handi Zhang,Haoshuang Wang,Wenbin Chang,Yiqun Liu,Qingqing Dang,Dianhai Yu,Yanjun Ma,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CCQ is a novel quantization method for LLMs, compressing models to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss, enabling efficient single-GPU deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high inference costs and deployment barriers of LLMs by overcoming accuracy and efficiency issues in sub-3-bit quantization.

Method: Uses Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster with hardware-aware bit-shift encoding/decoding to optimize inference.

Result: Achieves outstanding performance, compressing models like DeepSeek-V3 and ERNIE-4.5 for single-GPU deployment.

Conclusion: CCQ effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, making high-performance LLM deployment feasible at extremely low bit-widths.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

*Zixuan Huang,Kecheng Huang,Lihao Yin,Bowei He,Huiling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Zili Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Guard, an attention-aware GNN-based classifier, defends against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs by constructing entity graphs and using attention-aware augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, which are harder to detect than single-turn attacks.

Method: G-Guard builds entity graphs for multi-turn queries and uses attention-aware augmentation to retrieve similar single-turn queries for classification.

Result: G-Guard outperforms all baselines in detecting harmful queries across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: G-Guard effectively mitigates multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeMul eliminates LLM description extraction, directly distilling knowledge into prompts for richer semantics and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using LLM-extracted descriptions suffer from variability and unreliability.

Method: Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) directly distills LLM knowledge into prompts, avoiding discrete templates and using prompt weighting.

Result: Superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Conclusion: DeMul offers a robust, efficient alternative to traditional prompt learning methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

*Huibo Xu,Runlong Yu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGFM improves time series forecasting by integrating flow matching with auxiliary model outputs, learning from errors, and using historical data for better predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of diffusion models in forecasting, like rigid distributions and limited sampling paths, by leveraging flow matching's flexibility and untapped potential.

Method: Proposes Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), incorporating auxiliary model outputs, historical data, and constructing two-sided conditional probability paths with affine paths.

Result: CGFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting tasks, demonstrating improved prediction quality.

Conclusion: CGFM effectively advances forecasting methods by combining flow matching with error learning and flexible probability paths.

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

*Elia Piccoli,Malio Li,Giacomo Carfì,Vincenzo Lomonaco,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a method to combine embeddings from multiple pre-trained models for Reinforcement Learning (RL), balancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL agents lack prior knowledge and rely on monolithic models or learning from scratch. The paper addresses the understudied question of leveraging multiple pre-trained models in RL.

Method: Introduces WSA, an architecture to combine embeddings from multiple pre-trained models to enrich state representation.

Result: WSA achieves comparable performance to end-to-end models on Atari games and shows promising generalization and scalability with more models.

Conclusion: WSA effectively combines pre-trained models in RL, offering a balance between efficiency and performance, with potential for further scaling.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can generalize over compositional tasks with sufficient data and model scaling, though failures persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how neural networks can capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous nature.

Method: Scaling data and model size, testing across task encodings, and analyzing hidden activations.

Result: Scaling leads to compositional generalization, and task constituents can be linearly decoded from activations.

Conclusion: Neural networks can achieve compositional generalization with proper scaling and coverage, but failures highlight limitations.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

*Yunyi Li,Maria De-Arteaga,Maytal Saar-Tsechansky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a machine learning framework to detect mislabeled data affected by label bias, improving data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label bias causes systematic errors in datasets, posing a significant challenge in data integrity, especially in critical domains like hate speech detection. Existing solutions are limited.

Method: Proposes DeCoLe, a framework for bias-aware mislabeling detection, theoretically justified and empirically tested in hate speech detection.

Result: DeCoLe outperforms other label error detection methods, demonstrating effectiveness in bias-aware mislabeling detection.

Conclusion: DeCoLe addresses label bias challenges and can enhance data reliability in organizational systems.

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

*Minchan Jeong,J. Jon Ryu,Se-Young Yun,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable, simple method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator is proposed, avoiding unstable operations like SVD and matrix inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (e.g., VAMPnet, DPNet) rely on numerically unstable operations, leading to biased gradients and scalability issues.

Method: Uses low-rank approximation to learn the top-k singular functions, avoiding unstable linear algebraic operations.

Result: Learned singular subspaces are reliable and effective for tasks like eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed method is scalable, stable, and integrates well with deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

TL;DR: MUSE improves LLM uncertainty quantification by aggregating diverse model outputs using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, outperforming single-model and naive ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show inconsistent behavior, necessitating better uncertainty quantification, especially in high-stakes scenarios. Prior work ignores model diversity's potential.

Method: Proposes MUSE, using Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs.

Result: Experiments show MUSE enhances calibration and predictive performance in binary tasks.

Conclusion: MUSE leverages model diversity for more reliable uncertainty estimates, proving effective in practical settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a challenging dataset for benchmarking ML methods in fracture modeling, evaluates baseline models, and highlights their promise and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in ML techniques for fracture modeling by providing a realistic and complex dataset based on PFM simulations.

Method: Created a dataset with 6,000 PFM simulations, including varied energy decompositions, boundary conditions, and crack configurations. Evaluated PINN, FNO, and UNet models, and explored ensembling strategies.

Result: The dataset and baseline models provide a standardized benchmark. Results show promise but also limitations of current ML models in fracture mechanics.

Conclusion: The work offers a valuable testbed for advancing ML in fracture mechanics, demonstrating the need for further model improvements.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 training, evaluating energy and hardware efficiency, identifying Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA as the most energy-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of rigorous evaluation on energy usage and hardware demands of efficient attention variants in LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Benchmark eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 training, measuring training time, GPU memory, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption.

Result: Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA are the most energy-efficient, with training time being as critical as GPU power for energy use.

Conclusion: Energy-aware benchmarking is crucial for attention design, and kernel-optimized mechanisms offer the best resource efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

*Giulio Rossolini,Fabio Brau,Alessandro Biondi,Battista Biggio,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a security risk in partitioned deep learning models across IoT environments, where intercepted intermediate features can be exploited to craft transferable adversarial attacks, even in black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distributed nature of deep learning models in IoT environments exposes new vulnerabilities, particularly the risk of adversaries intercepting intermediate features to craft effective attacks.

Method: The study proposes an exploitation strategy involving reconstructing tensor shapes from intercepted features and adapting surrogate models to distill features, enabling highly transferable adversarial examples.

Result: Experiments show that surrogate models trained with intercepted features significantly improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to address intermediate feature leakage in secure distributed deep learning system designs.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

TL;DR: Combining wearable IMU and contactless radar data improves food intake gesture detection, with a proposed robust multimodal framework (MM-TCN-CMA) maintaining performance even if one modality is missing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dietary monitoring by improving the accuracy and robustness of food intake gesture detection using multimodal sensing.

Method: Proposed MM-TCN-CMA, a multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention, integrating IMU and radar data. Tested on a new dataset of 52 meal sessions.

Result: Improved segmental F1-score by 4.3% (vs. radar) and 5.2% (vs. IMU). Maintained gains of 1.3% (missing radar) and 2.4% (missing IMU).

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates robust multimodal fusion of IMU and radar for food intake detection, setting a precedent for future research.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Method: Adapts SemanticODE for interpretable trajectory modeling in causal settings, decoupling shape estimation from clinical properties.

Result: Accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, supporting rigorous analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: The method bridges causal analysis with practical healthcare applications by capturing dynamic treatment effects.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

*Aaron Foote,Danny Krizanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIP is a test to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores caused by model extrapolation, especially in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding feature importance is crucial in machine learning, but permutation feature importance can be misleading with dependent features.

Method: Developed TRIP, a minimal-assumption test to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores, and adapted it for high-dimensional settings.

Result: TRIP reliably detects unreliable permutation feature importance scores in simulated data and applications.

Conclusion: TRIP provides a reliable way to assess the validity of permutation feature importance, enhancing interpretability in machine learning models.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic Natural Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES) enhance NES with Bayesian quadrature, outperforming non-probabilistic NES and global methods like BO across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NES algorithms, while effective, suffer from limited sample efficiency due to reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates.

Method: Introduce ProbNES, integrating Bayesian quadrature into the NES framework to improve sample efficiency.

Result: ProbNES consistently outperforms non-probabilistic NES and global methods like BO in benchmark tasks, data-driven optimization, and hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: ProbNES offers a superior alternative to traditional NES and global optimization methods by leveraging Bayesian quadrature for enhanced efficiency.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

*Paola Causin,Alessio Marta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using Mixture of VAEs and Riemannian geometry addresses intrinsic dimension estimation, local coordinate construction, and manifold mapping, enhancing inverse problem solutions and model capacity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, but leveraging this requires addressing intrinsic dimension estimation, local coordinate construction, and manifold mapping.

Method: Proposes a framework combining Mixture of VAEs and Riemannian geometry, focusing on intrinsic dimension estimation via VAE decoder pullback metric rank.

Result: The framework improves inverse problem solutions (e.g., biomedical imaging) by ensuring reconstructions lie on the learned manifold and uses intrinsic dimension to monitor model capacity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses manifold learning challenges, enhancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications like biomedical imaging.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical operator learning and practical implementations, focusing on discretization independence and multifidelity learning for robustness and efficiency.

Method: Develops an encode-approximate-reconstruct model using neural representations, ensuring discretization independence. Validated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on PDEs.

Result: Demonstrates uniform universal approximation under strong assumptions and statistical approximation under weaker conditions. Multifidelity training improves accuracy, efficiency, and discretization independence.

Conclusion: The model effectively integrates theoretical and practical aspects of operator learning, with multifidelity training enhancing performance and robustness.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

TL;DR: AdeptHEQ-FL is a hybrid classical-quantum federated learning framework that improves model performance, privacy, and communication efficiency in non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-offs in FL between performance, privacy, and efficiency, especially in non-IID environments, while incorporating quantum-enhanced expressivity.

Method: Combines a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture, adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation with differential privacy, selective homomorphic encryption, and dynamic layer-wise freezing.

Result: Achieves ≈25.43% and ≈14.17% accuracy improvements over baselines on CIFAR-10, with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: AdeptHEQ-FL is efficient, privacy-preserving, and practical for FL, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and resource usage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Shiwen Mao,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A secure and efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design is proposed, optimizing resource allocation and user scheduling while incorporating differential privacy (DP). A novel DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence and rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in CFL, such as heterogeneous BS capabilities, non-IID user data, and limited resources, while ensuring privacy and efficiency.

Method: Proposes a DPVD-MARL algorithm for distributed optimization of RB allocation, user scheduling, and DP noise, with a dynamic penalty function for faster convergence.

Result: DPVD-MARL improves convergence rate by 20% and accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: The proposed CFL design and DPVD-MARL algorithm effectively optimize performance and privacy in federated learning.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deceptive signal-assisted private split learning method to protect model and data information from eavesdroppers, using a reinforcement learning framework (ICM-CA) for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent eavesdroppers from collecting sensitive model and data information during collaborative training by edge devices.

Method: A soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity and cross-attention (ICM-CA) is used to optimize device subsets for deceptive signals and model training.

Result: The method improves convergence by 3x and reduces information leakage by 13% compared to traditional SAC.

Conclusion: The ICM-CA framework effectively enhances privacy protection and training efficiency in split learning scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cGAN-based framework to generate stealthy adversarial attacks for UAV IDS evasion and a CVAE-based detector to identify such threats, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS and OOD detectors fail to detect novel or stealthy adversarial attacks, necessitating advanced solutions.

Method: A cGAN crafts adversarial samples from known attacks, while a CVAE uses negative log-likelihood to detect these stealthy threats.

Result: The CVAE-based detector outperforms traditional Mahalanobis distance methods in identifying adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling, like CVAE, is crucial for robust IDS against generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the plausibility-validity gap in LLMs for chemistry by fine-tuning the Magistral Small model with LoRA and a dual-domain dataset, improving chemical validity and synthesis feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between plausible but invalid outputs of LLMs in specialized domains like chemistry.

Method: Fine-tuned the Magistral Small model using LoRA and a curated dual-domain dataset of molecular properties and reactions.

Result: Improved format adherence, chemical validity, and synthesis feasibility, though limitations like stereochemistry errors persist.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable chemical tools, with identified areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: A lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer is added to graph transformers to route nodes to suitable manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic), improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph transformers embed nodes in a single Euclidean space, which may not capture heterogeneous topologies effectively.

Method: Prepend a Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer to project nodes onto appropriate manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic) based on local structure.

Result: Accuracy improves by up to 3% on node-classification benchmarks, with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware projection enhances predictive power and interpretability of graph representations.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) and context sample enhancement (CSE) to improve generalization in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) when training on a single context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL policies often fail to generalize to environments with different parameters due to insufficient training data across diverse contexts.

Method: The authors propose CEBE for better generalization and derive CSE as a data augmentation method to approximate CEBE in deterministic control environments.

Result: CEBE provides a first-order approximation to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts, and CSE is validated numerically in simulations.

Conclusion: CEBE and CSE show promise for enhancing generalization in DRL, especially when training data is limited.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU learning is common in real-world applications, but prior work relies on unrealistic assumptions like known class priors. This paper addresses these gaps.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PU learning under varied setups, without assuming a known class prior.

Result: Upper and lower bounds on sample sizes for positively labeled and unlabeled data are proven.

Conclusion: The study advances PU learning by relaxing assumptions and providing rigorous sample size bounds.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GO-CBED is a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for efficient causal experimental design, focusing on user-specified causal quantities rather than full model inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods aim to infer the full causal model, which can be inefficient. GO-CBED targets specific causal queries for more efficient experimentation.

Method: The framework uses a variational lower bound estimator, optimized via a transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors for real-time decision-making.

Result: GO-CBED outperforms existing baselines in causal reasoning tasks, especially with limited budgets and complex mechanisms.

Conclusion: Aligning experimental design with specific goals and forward-looking planning improves efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATHENA, a hierarchical graph neural network framework for personalized subclinical atherosclerosis classification, integrating clinical and molecular data to improve performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack consistency in leveraging cohort-wide features and integrating shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients, limiting understanding of atherosclerotic trajectories.

Method: ATHENA constructs a hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning, optimizing patient-specific molecular fingerprints while aligning with cohort-wide patterns.

Result: The framework improved classification performance by up to 13% in AUC and 20% in F1 score on a dataset of 391 patients.

Conclusion: ATHENA enhances personalized intervention strategies and disease progression prediction through explainable AI-driven subnetwork clustering.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward hacking in RLHF by proposing a unified reward modeling framework combining Bradley-Terry and regression-based methods, improving robustness and performance in OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models in RLHF are vulnerable to reward hacking, especially in OOD scenarios, and existing methods struggle with multi-attribute scoring due to limited data.

Method: A unified framework jointly trains Bradley-Terry single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space.

Result: The framework enhances robustness against reward hacking and improves scoring performance, with a 7B model outperforming a 70B baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates reward hacking and boosts reward model performance, particularly in challenging OOD settings.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to

framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice layer thickness and variability in radar imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, evaluating ice dynamics, and reducing climate model uncertainties.

Method: GRIT integrates an inductive geometric graph learning framework with an attention mechanism to map relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers.

Result: GRIT outperforms baseline graph neural networks with lower prediction errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of its attention mechanism and spatiotemporal modeling.

Conclusion: GRIT's combination of transformers and graph neural networks provides a robust solution for analyzing complex ice layer dynamics in radar data.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal
ice layers in Radar imagery is essential in monitoring the snow accumulation,
better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

TL;DR: ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer, improves ice layer thickness estimation in radargrams by leveraging attention mechanisms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice layer thickness and variability is vital for climate models and ice dynamics, but current methods lack robustness in handling noise and long-range dependencies.

Method: ST-GRIT uses an inductive geometric graph learning framework with separate spatial and temporal attention blocks to model relationships in radargram data.

Result: ST-GRIT achieves lower root mean-squared error than state-of-the-art methods on Greenland ice sheet data.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT's attention mechanisms enhance noise handling and dependency modeling, offering a superior approach for ice layer analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

*Seonghyun Park,Kiyoung Seong,Soojung Yang,Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLC is a framework for learning collective variables (CVs) from time-lagged conditions of a generative model, improving rare event sampling in molecular dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in molecular dynamics are hard to observe due to long timescales; existing CV discovery methods lack dynamic detail.

Method: TLC learns CVs by modeling time-lagged conditional distributions, capturing slow dynamics.

Result: TLC outperforms existing methods in transition path sampling and state discrimination for the Alanine Dipeptide system.

Conclusion: TLC provides superior CVs for enhanced sampling, advancing rare event observation in simulations.

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GTED, a novel evaluation framework for autoformalization, outperforming existing metrics in accuracy and Kappa scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current evaluation methods for statement autoformalization, such as lack of semantic understanding and high computational costs.

Method: GTED standardizes formal statements into operator trees and uses Generalized Tree Edit Distance for semantic similarity.

Result: GTED achieves highest accuracy and Kappa scores on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTED provides a more faithful metric for automated evaluation of autoformalization.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

*Pengfei Jiao,Jialong Ni,Di Jin,Xuan Guo,Huan Liu,Hongjiang Chen,Yanxian Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGMP, a multi-task prompt framework for heterogeneous graph tasks, addressing the mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks. It unifies task formats, uses contrastive pre-training, and introduces feature prompts to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks in heterogeneous graph neural networks leads to suboptimal performance. Prompt learning offers a flexible solution.

Method: HGMP reformulates tasks into a unified graph-level format, employs a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy, and introduces heterogeneous feature prompts.

Result: Experiments show HGMP adapts well to various tasks and outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: HGMP effectively bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, enhancing performance in heterogeneous graph scenarios.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott,Adam S. Shai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep neural networks pretrained on next-token prediction inherently represent beliefs over low-dimensional generative models of their data, akin to iterative Bayesian updates, outperforming classical circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that neural networks naturally discover and represent beliefs over generative models of their training data, a capability not achievable by finite classical circuits.

Method: Analyze deep neural networks (transformers, RNNs) pretrained on next-token prediction, examining their representations of low-dimensional generative models and the geometric relationships among neural activations.

Result: Neural networks intrinsically represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' models, with geometric relationships among activations being architecture-independent. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a probability density over futures.

Conclusion: Neural networks inherently perform iterative Bayesian updates over latent states, revealing a universal geometric representation of beliefs across architectures.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical sciences face unique challenges with datasets that are difficult for conventional machine learning, motivating the exploration of GPMs.

Method: The review examines the fundamental principles of GPMs and their recent applications in chemical sciences.

Result: GPMs show promise in solving untrained tasks and handling low-data scenarios, though many applications are still in the prototype phase.

Conclusion: GPMs are expected to mature and become more impactful in chemical sciences in the near future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTME-MTL is a dynamic token modulation framework for transformer-based MTL, improving adaptability and reducing negative transfer without excessive parameter growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative transfer in MTL due to conflicting objectives and rigid transformer structures limits performance.

Method: DTME-MTL identifies gradient conflicts in token space and applies adaptive solutions, avoiding parameter duplication.

Result: DTME-MTL enhances multi-task performance efficiently with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: DTME-MTL offers a scalable and effective solution for transformer-based MTL by operating in token space.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers, finding CSP-LDA and MDRM-T provide the best uncertainty estimates, while Deep Ensembles and CNNs offer superior classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers, addressing overconfidence in Deep Learning and underconfidence in traditional methods.

Method: Comparison of CSP-LDA, MDRM, Deep Ensembles, Direct Uncertainty Quantification, and CNNs, with Temperature Scaling applied to MDRM (MDRM-T).

Result: CSP-LDA and MDRM-T yield the best uncertainty estimates; Deep Ensembles and CNNs perform best in classification. All models distinguish easy/difficult samples, enabling accuracy improvement by rejecting ambiguous samples.

Conclusion: Traditional methods (CSP-LDA, MDRM-T) excel in uncertainty quantification, while Deep Learning methods (Deep Ensembles, CNNs) lead in classification accuracy, collectively enhancing BCI reliability.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCV combines PVGs and CBMs for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings, outperforming baselines and mitigating shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PVGs lack application to complex inputs like images, while CBMs are limited by linear predictors. NCV aims to unify these for better performance and interpretability.

Method: NCV uses minimally supervised concept discovery for structured encodings, with a prover selecting subsets and a nonlinear verifier for decisions.

Result: NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG baselines on complex datasets and reduces shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: NCV is a promising approach for performative, verifiable AI in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD is a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, offering efficient single-pass processing and superior performance in high-dimensional data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of real-time data streams, especially in IoT, demands efficient anomaly detection methods that operate with minimal memory and fast decision-making.

Method: DAD dynamically learns and monitors data correlation structures sample by sample in a single pass, avoiding the need for storing historical data.

Result: DAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse anomaly types and scales well with increasing dimensionality.

Conclusion: DAD sets a new standard for real-time anomaly detection by balancing efficacy and efficiency, making it ideal for high-dimensional, memory-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, inversion-free framework for context-aware low-rank approximation in neural networks, addressing numerical instabilities in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for neural network compression and fine-tuning suffer from numerical instabilities due to reliance on explicit Gram matrix computation and inversion, degrading approximation quality.

Method: A novel inversion-free regularized framework is proposed, using stable decompositions to handle GPU memory limits, near-singular matrices, and insufficient data.

Result: The method ensures stable performance even in challenging scenarios, with proven convergence and explicit error bounds for insufficient data cases.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes numerical pitfalls of prior methods, offering a robust solution for context-aware low-rank approximation.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional handovers face delays and failures in complex networks; CHOs improve success rates but introduce new challenges like resource allocation and signaling overhead.

Method: A novel framework using meta-learning, aligned with O-RAN, optimizes CHOs with dynamic regret guarantees.

Result: The framework demonstrates at least 180% superior performance over 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: Meta-learning effectively optimizes CHOs, addressing modern cellular network challenges and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

TL;DR: Proposes a BERT-based clustering pipeline for mapping O*NET occupations, evaluates dimensionality reduction, and improves results with a specialized silhouette approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occupational definitions vary across firms and countries, necessitating a mapping mechanism for expanding O*NET data.

Method: Uses BERT-based techniques with clustering approaches and evaluates dimensionality reduction effects.

Result: Improved clustering results using a specialized silhouette approach.

Conclusion: The approach aids automatic occupation distinction, supporting career transitions.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workers face high stress, especially during COVID-19, but current wearable sensor studies lack comprehensive data and robust analysis.

Method: A multimodal dataset (physiological signals, EDA, heart rate, skin temperature) was preprocessed with SMOTE. ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP) were combined into a Stacking Classifier.

Result: The study developed a reproducible pipeline for stress monitoring, improving model generalizability and addressing class imbalance.

Conclusion: The work advances deployable stress-monitoring systems, with future research focusing on demographic diversity and edge-computing for real-time alerts.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic molecular communication (SMC) to modulate the gut-brain axis (GBA) for personalized healthcare, leveraging machine learning to identify effective modulatory pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generating in-body molecular signals directly, the paper explores indirect modulation of the GBA, a natural in-body MC system, for therapeutic purposes, particularly in treating neurological diseases like drug refractory epilepsy (DRE).

Method: The study defines theoretical requirements for GBA modulation and proposes a machine learning model to verify these requirements using limited data. The model is evaluated on datasets to identify effective GBA modulators.

Result: The machine learning model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying GBA modulators and specific pathways crucial for therapeutic modulation.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for designing personalized GBA-based treatments, improving upon existing standardized methods by leveraging in-body IoBNT devices and machine learning.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Motivation: Traditional federated learning is unsustainable for IoT ecosystems due to high resource demands, conflicting with green AI principles.

Method: Combines aggregate computing for self-organization and neural network sparsification to minimize energy and bandwidth use.

Result: Reduces resource consumption while maintaining collaborative intelligence.

Conclusion: SParSeFuL offers a sustainable solution for federated learning in IoT, aligning with Society 5.0 goals.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of
resource-constrained devices attempt to participate. To this end, we introduce
Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL), a resource-aware
approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and
bandwidth consumption.

*Junyu Luo,Yuhao Tang,Yiwei Fu,Xiao Luo,Zhizhuo Kou,Zhiping Xiao,Wei Ju,Wentao Zhang,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLOGAN introduces sparse causal modeling and generative intervention for stable graph domain adaptation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UGDA methods underperform due to entangled causal-spurious features and ineffective global alignment.

Method: SLOGAN uses sparse causal modeling, variational inference, and generative intervention to disentangle features and align domains.

Result: SLOGAN achieves superior performance on real-world datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SLOGAN effectively addresses UGDA challenges through causal feature disentanglement and dynamic intervention.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer model, improves Parkinson's Disease detection from EEG data by addressing inter-subject variability and achieving higher accuracy and consistency compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL models for EEG-based PD detection suffer from poor generalizability due to high inter-subject variability, necessitating better architectures tailored to EEG data.

Method: TransformEEG combines a depthwise convolutional tokenizer with a transformer encoder to generate channel-specific tokens for effective feature mixing. It was evaluated on harmonized EEG datasets using Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation.

Result: TransformEEG achieved the highest median balanced accuracy (78.45%) and lowest variability (6.37% IQR). With augmentation and threshold correction, accuracy improved to 80.10% (5.74% IQR).

Conclusion: TransformEEG provides more consistent and reliable PD detection, reducing variability and outperforming other EEG-based DL models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

*Carlos Beis Penedo,Rebeca P. Díaz Redondo,Ana Fernández Vilas,Manuel Fernández Veiga,Francisco Troncoso Pastoriza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized architecture combining Federated Split Learning (FSL) with Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is proposed to address privacy and scalability issues in collaborative machine learning, achieving comparable accuracy to centralized methods with reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional Federated Learning (central server risks) and Split Learning (poor scalability), ensuring privacy and scalability in sensitive domains.

Method: Integrates FSL with HLF, using chaincode for decentralized model execution and aggregation, leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections for privacy.

Result: Matches centralized FSL accuracy on CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks, reduces training time per epoch, and shows minimal blockchain overhead.

Conclusion: The HLF-FSL approach is viable for enterprise deployment, offering privacy, scalability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

### [83] [Some Theoretical Results on Layerwise Effective Dimension Oscillations in Finite Width ReLU Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07675)
*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the layerwise effective dimension (rank) in finite-width ReLU networks, showing geometric decay of rank deficit and identifying revival depths where rank peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how random ReLU layers affect the rank of hidden activation matrices and how this influences network expressivity.

Method: Derives closed-form expressions for expected rank of activation matrices under random Gaussian weights, including sub-Gaussian concentration bounds and revival depth analysis.

Result: Rank deficit decays geometrically (ratio ≈0.3634), with revival peaks at specific depths (≈0.79m). Oscillatory rank behavior is a finite-width phenomenon.

Conclusion: Provides nuanced insights into how ReLU layers collapse and revive input subspaces, contrasting with prior work on deep network expressivity.

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

*Zhuang Qi,Lei Meng,Han Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCBDR introduces a class-wise balancing data replay method for FCIL, addressing class imbalance with global coordination and task-aware temperature scaling, improving accuracy by 2%-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in federated class incremental learning limits performance, especially in replay-based methods.

Method: FedCBDR uses global-perspective data replay for balanced sampling and task-aware temperature scaling to adjust logits.

Result: Achieves 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedCBDR effectively balances class-wise sampling and enhances generalization under task imbalance.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

*Peiyan Zhang,Haibo Jin,Liying Kang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuardVal, a dynamic evaluation protocol for jailbreak attacks on LLMs, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and improving vulnerability assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak evaluation methods are inadequate due to evolving LLM threats and lack of dynamic assessment, necessitating a more robust protocol.

Method: GuardVal dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, with an optimization method to prevent stagnation.

Result: Applied to models like Mistral-7b and GPT-4, GuardVal reveals distinct behavioral patterns and deeper vulnerabilities, enhancing robustness understanding.

Conclusion: GuardVal provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM vulnerabilities, offering insights for future research and more secure model development.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

*Tomu Hirata,Undral Byambadalai,Tatsushi Oka,Shota Yasui,Shingo Uto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-task neural network method for estimating distributional treatment effects (DTE) outperforms conventional ATE-focused approaches, addressing data imbalance and computational inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTE offers granular insights into experiment outcomes, but existing regression methods struggle with precision in distribution tails and computational demands.

Method: Uses multi-task neural networks with monotonic constraints and multi-threshold label learning to estimate conditional outcome distributions.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on simulated and real-world datasets, including water conservation and streaming platform A/B tests.

Conclusion: The method is robust and practical for modern causal inference, especially where treatment effect heterogeneity is critical.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

*Jaeheun Jung,Bosung Jung,Suhyun Bae,Donghun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shallow forgetting in machine unlearning, introduces a 'deep forgetting' criterion, and proposes the One-Point-Contraction (OPC) algorithm for robust unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods only superficially forget data, retaining internal representations vulnerable to attacks. The goal is to ensure deep, irreversible forgetting.

Method: Defines 'deep forgetting' via one-point-contraction of feature representations. Proposes OPC, an efficient approximation algorithm for unlearning.

Result: OPC outperforms existing methods in unlearning benchmarks, resisting performance recovery and gradient-inversion attacks.

Conclusion: OPC's deep feature forgetting enhances robustness, highlighting the need for more secure unlearning methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX is a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns adversaries to classes based on their vulnerability, improving fairness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods treat all classes uniformly, leading to unfair robustness where strong classes become more robust while weak classes remain vulnerable.

Method: TRIX adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, with per-class loss weighting and perturbation adjustments.

Result: TRIX improves worst-case class accuracy, reduces inter-class robustness disparities, and maintains overall accuracy on benchmarks like PGD and AutoAttack.

Conclusion: TRIX advances fair and effective adversarial defense by addressing class-wise vulnerability disparities.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

TL;DR: The paper explores the scalability and generalization challenges of RL in building energy management, proposing a multi-objective contextual RL framework and a benchmark for evaluating generalizable algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scalability and generalization in RL-based building energy management across diverse environments and objectives.

Method: Formalizes the multi-objective contextual RL problem, parameterizes contextual information, and creates a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Existing multi-objective RL methods achieve trade-offs but degrade under certain variations, highlighting the need for dynamics-dependent contextual learning.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information is crucial for improving RL policy generalization in building energy management.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

TL;DR: S4T synchronizes multiple tasks during test-time training to address domain shifts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in generalizing neural networks to unseen domains, especially when handling multiple tasks with unsynchronized adaptation needs.

Method: Proposes S4T, which predicts task relations across domain shifts to synchronize tasks during test-time training.

Result: S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods on multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: S4T effectively synchronizes tasks under domain shifts, enhancing multi-task performance.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a space-filling regularization method to improve state space data distribution, enhancing training, interpretability, and robustness in nonlinear system identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor state space data coverage due to trajectory deformation hinders training and interpretability in nonlinear systems.

Method: Proposes a data-distribution-based penalty for space-filling regularization, applied to local affine state space models.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on a benchmark, improving data distribution and model performance.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses trajectory deformation issues, enhancing training and interpretability in system identification.

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

TL;DR: SAMVAE is a multimodal deep learning framework for survival analysis in oncology, integrating six data modalities to improve predictions and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival prediction methods rely on single data modalities, limiting their ability to capture tumor complexity. SAMVAE addresses this by integrating diverse data sources.

Method: SAMVAE uses modality-specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space, enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality-specific information. It includes parametric outputs for clinical insights.

Result: SAMVAE achieves competitive performance in survival analysis and competing risks scenarios, validated on breast cancer and lower grade glioma datasets.

Conclusion: SAMVAE establishes a foundation for interpretable, data-driven survival analysis in oncology, enhancing clinical decision-making with multimodal data integration.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and robustness of transformers by refining the Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks and introducing a lightweight regularization method.

Method: Develop a refined closed-form expression for the spectral norm of the softmax function to derive a more accurate Lipschitz bound. Introduce JaSMin, a regularization term to minimize Jacobian softmax norms.

Result: The new Lipschitz bound is more accurate and reveals dependencies on attention score maps. JaSMin improves transformer robustness and reduces local Lipschitz constants.

Conclusion: The refined Lipschitz bound and JaSMin regularization enhance transformer robustness and provide deeper insights into the role of attention maps in model stability.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Method: Introduces data-dependent Bernstein inequalities for vector-valued processes in Hilbert space, exploiting correlation decay.

Result: Novel risk bounds for covariance operator estimation and operator learning in dynamical systems.

Conclusion: The proposed inequalities improve estimation and are validated through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

*Giovanni Dispoto,Paolo Bonetti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm extracts interpretable policies (e.g., linear policies) from expert behavior in DRL, balancing performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in DRL, which limits deployment in mission-critical and real-world applications.

Method: Uses the advantage function to train interpretable policies from collected experience, unlike prior works.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in classic control environments and financial trading, extracting meaningful insights from complex policies.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the gap between performance and interpretability in DRL.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

*Haichen Hu,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how pre-trained AI models for imputing missing covariates affect decision-making regret, introducing 'model elasticity' to quantify reward sensitivity to imputation errors. It shows that calibration under MAR improves regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of pre-trained AI models on sequential decision-making when covariates are missing and how to mitigate regret caused by imputation errors.

Method: Introduces 'model elasticity' to measure reward sensitivity to imputation discrepancies and uses orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression for model calibration under MAR.

Result: Demonstrates that calibration improves imputation quality and regret guarantees, emphasizing the value of accurate pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Model elasticity is a key metric for integrating pre-trained models in decision-making, with calibration under MAR enhancing performance.

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

*Navish Kumar,Thomas Möllenhoff,Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of theoretical convergence guarantees for natural-gradient descent in variational inference, particularly for Gaussian approximations, by proposing a square-root parameterization for covariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the practical success of natural-gradient descent in variational inference, theoretical convergence guarantees are lacking, even for simple cases like concave log-likelihoods with Gaussian approximations.

Method: The authors introduce a square-root parameterization for the Gaussian covariance to circumvent the challenge, enabling convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and its continuous-time gradient flow.

Result: The proposed approach establishes novel convergence guarantees, and experiments show the effectiveness of natural gradient methods over Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Conclusion: The square-root parameterization provides a solution to the theoretical convergence challenge, validating the practical advantages of natural-gradient methods.

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

*Zizhou Zhang,Qinyan Shen,Zhuohuan Hu,Qianying Liu,Huijie Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GNN-based framework improves SME credit risk analysis by leveraging transaction and social data, outperforming traditional methods with high AUC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs lack sufficient credit data, especially for online lenders, necessitating innovative methods like GNNs to analyze interactions and predict risks.

Method: Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model SME interactions from transaction and social data, mapping spatial dependencies for risk prediction.

Result: Achieves AUCs of 0.995 (supply chain mining) and 0.701 (default prediction), outperforming traditional and other GNN baselines.

Conclusion: The GNN framework is scalable and effective for SME credit risk assessment, aiding regulators and stress testers.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

*Wenxuan Zhou,Shujian Zhang,Brice Magdalou,John Lambert,Ehsan Amid,Richard Nock,Andrew Hard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects direct preference optimization (DPO) to two major theories in ML preference learning, highlighting its generality and practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled understanding of DPO by linking it to Savage's loss functions and stochastic choice theory, addressing its broad applicability and pitfalls.

Method: Establishes a connection between Savage's losses and stochastic choice theory, generalizing DPO to include abstention, non-convex objectives, and extensions like margins and length corrections.

Result: The framework covers a wide range of DPO variations, revealing their limitations and potential workarounds.

Conclusion: Understanding DPO's theoretical foundations is crucial for its diverse applications and avoiding pitfalls in its variations.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

*Tianang Leng,Fangping Wan,Marcelo Der Torossian Torres,Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ApexOracle is an AI model that predicts antibiotic potency and designs new molecules for novel pathogens, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the slow pace of antibiotic development necessitate faster, more effective solutions for combating emerging pathogens.

Method: ApexOracle integrates molecular features via a diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework combining genomic and literature data for pathogen-specific context.

Result: It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in activity prediction and reliably transfers to novel pathogens, even with minimal data. It also generates new effective molecules.

Conclusion: ApexOracle provides a scalable solution to AMR by combining rapid prediction and targeted molecular generation.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Motivation: To improve binding affinity prediction in machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) using synthetic data augmentation via co-folding models.

Method: Evaluated feasibility of co-folding models for data augmentation, focusing on structural quality. Established heuristics to identify high-quality predictions without reference structures.

Result: Performance gains in MLSFs depend on structural quality of augmented data. Heuristics enable substitution of experimental structures with high-quality co-folding predictions.

Conclusion: Co-folding models can enhance MLSF training if high-quality predictions are identified, informing future data augmentation strategies.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data
augmentation in training machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for
binding affinity prediction. Our results show that performance gains depend
critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding
predictions without reference structures, enabling them to substitute for
experimental structures in MLSF training. Our study informs future data
augmentation strategies based on co-folding models.

*Hao Ban,Gokul Ram Subramani,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMO, a lightweight Sharpness-Aware Multi-task Optimization method, mitigates task conflicts in MTL by combining global and local perturbations efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task conflicts in MTL hinder performance; SAM's potential to address this is explored.

Method: SAMO integrates SAM into MTL with joint global-local perturbations, approximated using forward passes and layerwise normalization.

Result: SAMO effectively reduces task conflicts and improves efficiency in multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMO offers a practical solution for MTL optimization, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

*Ashe Neth,Sawinder kaur,Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,Subrata Biswas,Asif Salekin,Bashima Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnIT introduces unstructured inference-time pruning for MCUs, dynamically skipping unnecessary operations without retraining, achieving significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods underutilize fine-grained efficiency on devices lacking SIMD or parallel compute, prompting the need for a lightweight, retraining-free solution.

Method: UnIT dynamically skips MAC operations using input-specific activation patterns, replaces multiplications with threshold checks, and employs hardware-friendly division approximations.

Result: UnIT reduces MACs by 11.02-82.03%, speeds up inference by 27.30-84.19%, and lowers energy by 27.33-84.38% while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: UnIT proves unstructured inference-time pruning is viable for efficient, retraining-free DNN deployment on MCUs.

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-agent driven method to dynamically track emerging topics in earnings calls, structuring them into a hierarchical ontology for financial analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling fails to capture evolving industry trends dynamically.

Method: Uses an LLM-agent to extract topics, build a hierarchical ontology, and link new topics to existing ones.

Result: Demonstrates company-level insights and trend detection, evaluated via ontology coherence and topic evolution accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively surfaces emerging financial trends, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new low-resource attack method identifies benign prompts that unintentionally reconstruct training images from generative models, highlighting privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and copyright concerns in generative models by understanding how seemingly harmless prompts can reconstruct training data.

Method: Leverages domain knowledge and templated prompts from scraped e-commerce data to identify vulnerabilities, requiring minimal resources and training set access.

Result: Demonstrates that benign prompts (e.g., "blue Unisex T-Shirt") can reconstruct real-life images, revealing unintentional risks.

Conclusion: Highlights a fundamental vulnerability in generative models due to scraped data, emphasizing the need for better safeguards.

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

### [109] [Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955)
*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-Net, a hierarchical model that replaces traditional tokenization-LM pipelines with an end-to-end approach, outperforming token-based Transformers and improving robustness and efficiency, especially in languages with weaker tokenization heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization remains a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models despite advances in language models. The goal is to eliminate pre-processing steps like tokenization by learning dynamic, context-dependent segmentation strategies.

Method: The paper proposes H-Net, a hierarchical network with dynamic chunking mechanisms that learn segmentation strategies jointly with the model. It operates at multiple levels of abstraction, replacing tokenization with a single end-to-end model.

Result: H-Net outperforms token-based Transformers in performance and scaling, shows increased character-level robustness, and learns meaningful chunking strategies without supervision. It excels in languages like Chinese and modalities like code or DNA sequences.

Conclusion: H-Net demonstrates the potential of true end-to-end models, improving efficiency and performance by eliminating tokenization and scaling better with unprocessed data.

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to the prospective learning framework, addressing dynamic data and evolving goals in AI, and extends it to sequential decision-making like foraging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PAC learning fails with dynamic data and changing objectives, leading to suboptimal performance. Prospective learning offers a solution.

Method: The authors enhance the prospective learning framework, providing algorithmic and numerical improvements, and apply it to sequential decision-making (foraging).

Result: Preliminary results show improved performance in handling dynamic data and evolving goals, with successful application to foraging scenarios.

Conclusion: Prospective learning, with the proposed enhancements, effectively addresses limitations of PAC learning in dynamic environments and extends to sequential tasks.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

TL;DR: Q-chunking improves RL for long-horizon tasks by using action chunking in offline-to-online settings, enhancing exploration and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of leveraging offline data for effective exploration and sample-efficient learning in RL.

Method: Applies action chunking to TD-based RL, enabling temporally consistent behaviors and unbiased n-step backups.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in offline performance and online sample efficiency on sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: Q-chunking is a simple, effective solution for improving RL in long-horizon, sparse-reward settings.

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

*Perry Dong,Qiyang Li,Dorsa Sadigh,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EXPO improves sample efficiency in online RL by using an expressive base policy and a lightweight Gaussian edit policy to maximize value without direct optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expressive policies with online RL is challenging due to unstable gradient propagation.

Method: EXPO uses two policies: a stable expressive base policy and a Gaussian edit policy to maximize Q-value on-the-fly.

Result: EXPO achieves 2-3x better sample efficiency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: EXPO effectively addresses stable value maximization in expressive policy training.

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given

*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Layers (CoLa), a method to dynamically adapt pretrained LLM architectures per input, improving efficiency and performance via layer manipulation and MCTS optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether pretrained LLMs can adapt their architecture dynamically for different inputs without finetuning, addressing inefficiencies in fixed-depth models.

Method: Manipulate pretrained LLM layers as modules (skip, repeat, reorder) to form CoLa per sample, optimized via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Result: CoLa improves efficiency (shorter paths for 75% correct samples) and performance (corrects 60% of originally wrong predictions).

Conclusion: Fixed architectures limit LLMs; dynamic depth adaptation via CoLa unlocks potential for better generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

### [114] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) to address mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MEL approaches fail to handle mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MMoE includes description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, and intra/inter-level mixture of experts for dynamic feature selection.

Result: MMoE achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MMoE effectively addresses key challenges in MEL, offering a robust solution with dynamic feature selection capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [115] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss (CoPT) leverages domain-agnostic text embeddings for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in UDA methods for segmentation by utilizing domain-agnostic text properties, as annotations are harder to collect than in classification.

Method: Introduces CoPT, combining LLM-generated domain descriptions with frozen CLIP embeddings to learn domain-invariant features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks for UDA in segmentation.

Conclusion: CoPT effectively bridges the domain gap in segmentation tasks using text embeddings, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recall, an adversarial framework targeting vulnerabilities in unlearned image generation models (IGMs), revealing weaknesses in current unlearning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical and societal concerns of IGMs by testing the robustness of machine unlearning (MU) methods against adversarial attacks.

Method: Proposes Recall, a framework optimizing adversarial image prompts using multi-modal conditioning in diffusion models, evaluated across ten unlearning methods.

Result: Recall outperforms baselines in adversarial effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic fidelity, exposing vulnerabilities in unlearning mechanisms.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust unlearning solutions to ensure the safety of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive review of XAI methods in biomedical image analysis, emphasizing modality-aware perspectives, multimodal learning, and vision-language models, while offering practical guidance and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing XAI surveys by focusing on biomedical image analysis, incorporating modality-specific challenges, and exploring emerging multimodal and vision-language paradigms.

Method: Systematic categorization and analysis of XAI methods, proposing a modality-centered taxonomy, and examining multimodal learning and vision-language models.

Result: A structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical contexts, highlighting strengths, limitations, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The survey lays a foundation for advancing interpretable deep learning in biomedical image analysis, addressing persistent challenges and future opportunities.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by modality conflict, introduces a dataset (MMMC) to study it, and proposes three methods (prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) to mitigate it. Reinforcement learning performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address hallucinations in MLLMs arising from conflicts between input modalities, a previously overlooked issue.

Method: Defines modality conflict, constructs the MMMC dataset, and tests three mitigation methods: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reinforcement learning outperforms others in reducing hallucinations; supervised fine-tuning is stable.

Conclusion: Highlights modality conflict as a key cause of hallucinations and offers insights for improving MLLM robustness.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [119] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments using UAVs, combining YOLOv8 for detection, feature matching, and hue histogram analysis for target verification, with geometric localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous maritime surveillance is critical for applications like search and rescue and threat detection, especially when GNSS is unavailable and visual cues are the only means to identify targets.

Method: The approach uses YOLOv8 for vessel detection, followed by feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to verify the target. Geometric principles are then applied for localization.

Result: The method was tested in real-world experiments during MBZIRC2023, showing effectiveness in GNSS-denied navigation. The impact of perspective on accuracy and precision was evaluated and compared to an oracle approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of autonomous target vessel identification and localization in GNSS-denied environments, demonstrating practical viability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp is a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network that improves feature extraction and segmentation performance without needing extra labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp segmentation methods rely on additional labeled data or task similarity, limiting generalizability. CL-Polyp aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: Uses contrastive learning for discriminative feature extraction, along with MASPP and CA modules for multi-scale feature fusion and boundary reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five datasets, improving IoU by 0.011 and 0.020 on Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp is effective for clinical polyp segmentation, enhancing performance without extra annotations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model that reconstructs images from EEG signals using semantic captions and a transformer-based encoder, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome EEG's spatial limitations for image reconstruction by leveraging semantic captions for cognitively aligned visual decoding.

Method: Aligns EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions using a transformer-based encoder and contrastive learning. A pretrained latent diffusion model generates images from caption embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to neurocognitive pathways and semantic topography.

Conclusion: Structured semantic mediation enables effective and interpretable visual decoding from EEG signals.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: Current video generative models struggle with long-form videos (beyond 16 seconds), especially in maintaining character consistency and motion coherence. Recent work aims to improve this by analyzing 32 papers to identify effective architectural components and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of existing video generative models in producing long-form videos with consistent character appearances and scene layouts motivate the need for a comprehensive study to identify better methods.

Method: Analyzed 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies. Constructed a taxonomy and comparative tables categorizing methods by design and performance.

Result: Identified effective strategies for generating long-form videos with narrative coherence, high-fidelity detail, and multi-character consistency.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into improving long-form video generation by highlighting successful architectural designs and training approaches.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSCI, a lightweight RGB-only method for Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) that uses color to mitigate appearance bias without additional models or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive due to reliance on extra models or annotations. The authors explore color as a proxy for clothing-invariant features.

Method: Proposes CSCI, which uses foreground and background colors to capture appearance bias ('Color See') and disentangle it from identity features ('Color Ignore'). Introduces S2A self-attention to prevent information leak.

Result: Improves baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video ReID, without extra supervision.

Conclusion: Color is a cost-effective proxy for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID, validated by strong performance on datasets.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DisenQ, a multimodal language-guided framework for activity-biometrics, disentangling identity, motion, and non-biometrics features using structured textual supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person identification struggles with entangled identity cues due to motion and appearance variations in diverse activities. Additional visual data like pose/silhouette often suffer from extraction inaccuracies.

Method: Introduces DisenQ, a unified querying transformer that leverages structured language guidance to disentangle biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization to traditional video-based identification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively decouples identity from appearance and motion, preventing misidentifications and generalizing well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: LinguaMark benchmark evaluates multilingual capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) using a VQA task across 11 languages, revealing performance gaps and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of emphasis on multilingual evaluation in LMMs, which often produce biased outputs due to limited linguistic coverage.

Method: Introduce LinguaMark, a dataset of 6,875 image-text pairs in 11 languages, evaluated on Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness metrics.

Result: Closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini2.5) perform best overall, while open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) show competitive performance, with Qwen2.5 excelling in multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for better multilingual evaluation in LMMs and encourages further research with released dataset and code.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Motivation: To determine if vision-language models genuinely perform grounded visual reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and biases.

Method: Introduces MagiC, a benchmark with weakly supervised and human-curated QA examples, evaluating models on correctness, reasoning, grounding, and self-correction.

Result: Evaluation of 15 models reveals limitations in grounded reasoning, with new metrics like MagiScore and StepSense providing deeper insights.

Conclusion: MagiC highlights gaps in current models' grounded reasoning and offers opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual

*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADIEE introduces an automated dataset creation approach to train a scoring model for evaluating instruction-guided image editing, outperforming existing VLMs and proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of effective automated evaluation for instruction-guided image editing due to alignment issues in open-source VLMs and transparency/cost problems in proprietary models.

Method: Generates a large-scale dataset (100K+ samples) to fine-tune a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model, decoding numeric scores from a custom token.

Result: Outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5, improving score correlation with human ratings by 17.24% and pair-wise comparison accuracy by up to 9.35%.

Conclusion: The scorer serves as a reward model, enhancing automated edit selection and model fine-tuning, with demonstrated improvements in evaluation scores.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate and scalable foundation-skin tone color blending in virtual try-on applications.

Method: Proposes an approximation of Kubelka-Munk theory for faster image synthesis and builds a scalable end-to-end framework using e-commerce product data.

Result: Validated with real-world makeup images, showing superior performance over other techniques.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances realism and scalability in foundation makeup VTO applications.

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on

### [130] [Entity Re-identification in Visual Storytelling via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07340)
*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive reinforcement learning method to improve entity identity consistency in visual storytelling, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling models often fail to maintain consistent character and object identities across frames, leading to incoherent references.

Method: A contrastive reinforcement learning approach is used, extending the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negatives and employing Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function.

Result: Improvements include grounding mAP (14.8% increase), F1 (17.1% increase), pronoun grounding accuracy, and cross-frame entity persistence (13.7% increase for entities in 5+ frames).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances entity identity consistency and storytelling coherence, demonstrating measurable performance improvements.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC is a label-efficient technique for generalizable depth completion, leveraging pseudo geometries and scale manipulation to enhance data diversity with minimal annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable depth completion models requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are labor-intensive to collect. PacGDC addresses this by reducing annotation dependency.

Method: PacGDC synthesizes pseudo geometries by manipulating scene scales of depth maps using multiple depth foundation models. It incorporates interpolation, relocation, and unlabeled images for further diversity.

Result: PacGDC achieves strong generalizability across benchmarks, performing well in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: PacGDC offers a scalable and efficient solution for generalizable depth completion, reducing reliance on annotated datasets while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

### [132] [Adaptive Particle-Based Shape Modeling for Anatomical Surface Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07379)
*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSM improves shape modeling by introducing adaptive particle configurations using neighborhood correspondence loss and geodesic regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PSM methods lack self-adaptivity, limiting their ability to accurately represent complex anatomical variability.

Method: Introduces two mechanisms: (1) neighborhood correspondence loss for adaptivity and (2) geodesic correspondence algorithm for consistency.

Result: Evaluated on challenging datasets, showing improved adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances PSM by balancing adaptivity and consistency, improving anatomical shape representation.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSAGSM, a lightweight plug-and-play module for Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos, enhancing temporal and spatial modeling. It also introduces the TTA dataset for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PES models lack sufficient temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability, limiting performance.

Method: MSAGSM combines multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention to improve GSM, enabling efficient short- and long-term dependency modeling.

Result: MSAGSM consistently improves performance across five PES benchmarks with minimal overhead, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MSAGSM is an effective solution for PES, and the TTA dataset advances the field by providing a benchmark for table tennis events.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

*Zhimin Zhang,Bi'an Du,Caoyuan Ma,Zheng Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for cross-category animal motion transfer preserves habitual behaviors, using a habit-preservation module and LLM for unobserved species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on human motion, neglecting animal habitual behaviors.

Method: Proposes a habit-preserved motion transfer framework with a category-specific habit encoder and LLM integration.

Result: Validated on DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, showing superior performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively preserves animal habits in motion transfer.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-Wild is an interactive segmentation method for unconstrained photo collections, using 3D Gaussian Splatting and multi-dimensional feature embeddings to address transient occlusions and lighting inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconstrained photo collections are easier to obtain but suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient occlusions, making segmentation challenging. Existing methods fail to address these issues.

Method: Proposes Seg-Wild, integrating multi-dimensional feature embeddings for 3D Gaussians and using feature similarity for interactive segmentation. Introduces Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth anomalies and projects 3D Gaussians to 2D for cutting.

Result: Seg-Wild outperforms previous methods in segmentation and reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: Seg-Wild effectively addresses challenges in unconstrained photo collections, offering improved segmentation and reconstruction. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for zero-shot novel view synthesis and amodal completion, outperforming multi-stage methods with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis and amodal completion are multi-stage and inefficient, lacking cross-view dependency consideration. EscherNet++ aims to address these limitations with an end-to-end approach.

Method: The model uses masked fine-tuning (input-level and feature-level masking) to enable end-to-end training, integrating with feed-forward image-to-mesh models for fast 3D reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: PSNR improved by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks, with 95% faster reconstruction time.

Conclusion: EscherNet++ demonstrates scalable, efficient, and accurate novel view synthesis and amodal completion, generalizing well to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC introduces an efficient prompt-based interaction strategy for text-image classification, reducing computational costs and trainable parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) are computationally expensive to fine-tune, prompting the need for efficient interaction strategies.

Method: EPIC uses temporal prompts on intermediate layers and similarity-based prompt interaction to align modalities efficiently.

Result: Achieves reduced resource consumption (1% of foundation model parameters) and superior performance on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE, comparable on MM-IMDB.

Conclusion: EPIC offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Result: Corvid outperforms similar MLLMs, excelling in mathematical and science problem-solving.

Conclusion: Corvid advances MLLM reasoning capabilities, offering improved performance in structured tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

TL;DR: DSANet improves ultrasound video segmentation by enhancing noise robustness through dual semantic-aware modules (AFSA and LGSA), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging's noise challenges hinder automated lesion/organ segmentation, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: DSANet uses AFSA for channel-wise feature fusion across frames and LGSA to integrate local and global features, avoiding pixel-level dependencies.

Result: DSANet achieves higher segmentation accuracy and faster inference (FPS) than existing methods on four datasets.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively mitigates noise in ultrasound segmentation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

TL;DR: A DCNN model is developed to detect BWV in skin lesions, achieving high accuracy across datasets, and is explained using XAI for better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on detecting BWV, a key feature for melanoma diagnosis, prompting the need for an advanced and interpretable detection method.

Method: A DCNN with custom layers is trained on annotated datasets created via color threshold techniques. XAI is used to interpret the model's decisions.

Result: High testing accuracies (85.71%-95.05%) are achieved across datasets, outperforming conventional models.

Conclusion: The proposed DCNN with XAI enhances BWV detection, aiding early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

*Jeonghoon Song,Sunghun Kim,Jaegyun Im,Byeongjoon Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Objectomaly improves OoD segmentation by refining anomaly scores with object-level priors, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing boundary imprecision, inconsistent scores, and false positives in mask-based OoD segmentation for safety-critical applications.

Method: Three-stage framework: Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS), Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC), and Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP).

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (e.g., AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR95 down to 0.07, F1-score up to 83.44).

Conclusion: Objectomaly is robust and generalizable, validated by ablation studies and real-world driving videos.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

### [145] [Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464)
*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GAN-based blind face image restoration (FIR) framework is proposed to address weather-induced degradations, outperforming existing methods by enhancing facial structure and color fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for robust face recognition systems in adverse weather conditions is increasing, but current FIR models lack dedicated modules for weather-induced degradations, leading to poor performance.

Method: The framework integrates two modules: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) for aligning local statistical distributions and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE) for robust feature extraction under adverse weather.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion-based FIR methods, improving texture and structural accuracy in restored faces.

Conclusion: The SFFT and DAFE modules effectively enhance face restoration under challenging weather, offering a promising solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

*Qiangqiang Wu,Yi Yu,Chenqi Kong,Ziquan Liu,Jia Wan,Haoliang Li,Alex C. Kot,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework for Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) to protect personal video data from unauthorized use in Visual Object Tracking (VOT), addressing inefficiencies and limitations of existing image-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in VOT, where unauthorized use of personal videos for training commercial models is overlooked.

Method: Proposes a generative framework for TUEs, incorporating a temporal contrastive loss to corrupt tracker learning and ensure data-privacy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models and datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively safeguards video data-privacy while maintaining scalability and generalizability.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Xinyuan Chang,Xinran Liu,Zheng Pan,Mu Xu,Ding Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online Map Association (OMA), a benchmark for associating global SD maps with online HD maps to improve autonomous vehicle navigation, along with a baseline method called Map Association Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with hybrid navigation due to the lack of association between global SD maps and online HD maps. This gap limits their planning capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the OMA benchmark, containing 480k roads and 260k lane paths, and introduce the Map Association Transformer framework, which uses path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms to understand geometric and topological correspondences.

Result: The OMA benchmark provides metrics for evaluating model performance, and the Map Association Transformer serves as a baseline method for associating hybrid maps.

Conclusion: The OMA benchmark and proposed framework enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by addressing the association challenge between SD and HD maps, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

*Binxu Li,Minkai Xu,Meihua Dang,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMPO is a novel method for aligning diffusion models with human preferences by minimizing reverse KL divergence, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving diffusion models by aligning them with human preferences, addressing suboptimal optimization in current methods.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), which minimizes reverse KL divergence for alignment.

Result: DMPO outperforms existing baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across datasets.

Conclusion: DMPO provides a robust and principled approach for aligning diffusion models, bridging theory and practice.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

### [149] [GGMotion: Group Graph Dynamics-Kinematics Networks for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07515)
*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion introduces a group graph dynamics-kinematics network to model human motion by leveraging physical dependencies between joints, improving realism and performance in motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect intrinsic physical dependencies in human motion, leading to unrealistic results and increased learning difficulty.

Method: GGMotion uses a radial field for graph networks, inter/intra-group interaction modules, and equivariant MLPs to update joint features, with an auxiliary loss for motion priors.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, showing superior short-term motion prediction.

Conclusion: GGMotion effectively captures physical dependencies, enhancing motion realism and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

### [150] [MUVOD: A Novel Multi-view Video Object Segmentation Dataset and A Benchmark for 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07519)
*Bangning Wei,Joshua Maraval,Meriem Outtas,Kidiyo Kpalma,Nicolas Ramin,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of labeled datasets. It includes 17 scenes with diverse views and provides RGB images, segmentation masks, and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a comprehensive labeled multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes motivated the creation of MUVOD.

Method: The dataset includes 17 scenes with 9-46 views, 7830 RGB images, and segmentation masks for 4D motion tracking. A baseline segmentation approach and evaluation metric are also provided.

Result: MUVOD offers 459 instances of 73 categories, serving as a benchmark for multi-view video segmentation. A subset is also proposed for 3D object segmentation evaluation.

Conclusion: MUVOD fills a gap in dynamic scene segmentation research and provides tools for evaluating and advancing methods in this field.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

### [151] [Spline Deformation Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07521)
*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spline-based trajectory representation is proposed to address issues in dense point trajectory modeling, improving spatial coherence and temporal interpolation without relying on heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for trajectory modeling either use opaque neural networks or heuristic-based explicit techniques, lacking spatial coherence and under-exploring implicit representations for sparse temporal signals.

Method: The paper introduces a spline-based trajectory representation with explicit knot degrees of freedom and a low-rank time-variant spatial encoding for modeling knot characteristics.

Result: The method outperforms in temporal interpolation and achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction while enhancing motion coherence.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances spatial coherence, temporal accuracy, and computational efficiency, advancing trajectory modeling.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX introduces a remote sensing foundation model using mixture-of-modality experts to address modality mismatches and fine-tuning challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing foundation models focus on specific modalities, creating mismatches for diverse applications and making fine-tuning expensive.

Method: MAPEX pre-trains on multi-modal data with a modality-conditioned token routing mechanism and uses modality-aware pruning for task-specific efficiency.

Result: MAPEX shows strong performance on diverse datasets, surpassing supervised training and state-of-the-art foundation models.

Conclusion: MAPEX effectively bridges modality gaps and simplifies fine-tuning, offering a scalable solution for remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

### [153] [Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07574)
*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'linear reasoning bottleneck' in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) and introduces the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC) to measure it. It reveals that the bottleneck stems from reasoning pathway failures, not perception, and shows task-dependent solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why VLMs struggle with abstract reasoning tasks despite good visual embeddings, focusing on the 'linear reasoning bottleneck.'

Method: Introduces LSC to measure linear separability of visual embeddings, uses postfix tuning as a control, and tests interventions like activating pathways or adapting weights.

Result: Finds widespread bottlenecks due to reasoning pathway failures. Shows task-dependent solutions: activating pathways for semantics, adapting weights for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs requires targeted alignment, not just better representation learning. The work offers a new analysis lens for VLMs.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework, DGKD-WLSS, improves weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light conditions by combining diffusion-guided knowledge distillation and depth-guided feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods perform poorly in low-light due to image degradation and weak supervision limitations, leading to unreliable class activation maps and ambiguous pseudo-labels.

Method: DGKD-WLSS uses Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) to align normal and low-light features and Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2) to incorporate depth maps for better structural learning.

Result: DGKD-WLSS achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses low-light challenges, enhancing feature learning and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The

Motivation: To tackle domain-shift challenges in industrial anomaly detection by leveraging vision foundation models and innovative feature fusion.

Method: Uses hierarchical adapter modules, shared subspace projection, MTL Decoder, and Sinkhorn-K-means clustering for anomaly scoring.

Result: Achieves 97.5% AUC, 70.4% AP, and 95.2% PRO on MVTec AD, outperforming recent models.

Conclusion: NexViTAD marks a significant advance in cross-domain defect detection with robust performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection
framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

*Wenfeng Jia,Bin Liang,Yuxi Lu,Attavit Wilaiwongsakul,Muhammad Arif Khan,Lihong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOTA, a multi-scale inference strategy, improves flood mapping accuracy by combining SegFormer and depth estimation, achieving better IoU and boundary precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flood mapping products lack spatial detail or ignore depth, limiting disaster response effectiveness.

Method: HOTA uses overlapping tiles of varying sizes on Sentinel-2 images with SegFormer for multi-scale feature capture, followed by DEM-based depth estimation.

Result: HOTA boosts IoU from 73% to 84% and achieves <0.5 m boundary error in Kempsey flood case study.

Conclusion: HOTA enables accurate, large-scale 3D flood mapping for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Motivation: Existing diffusion methods lack consistency in multi-view outputs, which is crucial for applications like digital humans and virtual avatars.

Method: The framework includes a multi-view training data pipeline (Bald Converter, inpainting model, face-finetuned diffusion model) and integrates polar-azimuth embeddings and temporal attention layers. A multi-stage training strategy is used.

Result: The method achieves detailed, realistic, and view-consistent hair transfer, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 sets a new benchmark for multi-view hair transfer, with publicly available code.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: Enhanced SAM2 framework for video object tracking with hierarchical motion estimation and optimized memory bank, achieving state-of-the-art results on LaSOT and LaSOText.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like occlusions, background clutter, and target reappearance in video object tracking.

Method: Hierarchical motion estimation (lightweight linear prediction + selective non-linear refinement) and optimized memory bank (long-term/short-term distinction).

Result: 9.6% and 7.2% relative AUC improvements on LaSOT and LaSOText; larger gains on smaller models.

Conclusion: Trainless, low-overhead enhancements effectively boost long-term tracking performance.

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object
tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter,
and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation
strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term
occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent
improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,

TL;DR: LOSC improves open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans by consolidating noisy image-based labels and training a 3D network, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noisy and sparse labels from image-based VLMs in 3D point clouds for driving scenarios.

Method: Consolidate labels for spatio-temporal consistency and robustness, then train a 3D network (LOSC).

Result: Outperforms SOTA in zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: LOSC is a simple yet effective method for refining and leveraging image-based labels in 3D segmentation.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing performance gaps and unexpected behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for spatial visualization in MLLMs are unreliable due to overlap with training data and lack of focus.

Method: SpatialViz-Bench includes 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities with 1,180 problems, evaluated on 33 MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs show wide performance variations, unexpected behaviors, and deficiencies in spatial visualization.

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench highlights gaps in MLLMs' spatial visualization, providing a reliable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

TL;DR: ViLU introduces a Vision-Language Uncertainty framework for reliable UQ and failure prediction in VLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliable uncertainty quantification and failure prediction in Vision-Language Models.

Method: ViLU integrates visual and textual embeddings via cross-attention, training a binary classifier for uncertainty prediction.

Result: Significant performance gains on datasets like ImageNet-1k, CC12M, and LAION-400M.

Conclusion: ViLU's architecture and training are critical for effective uncertainty quantification, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-GVC is a novel generative video coding framework that uses trajectory-guided motion sampling and diffusion-based guidance to achieve high-quality reconstructions at ultra-low bitrates, outperforming traditional and modern methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods are limited by domain specificity or reliance on text guidance, leading to unrealistic reconstructions and poor motion detail capture.

Method: T-GVC employs semantic-aware sparse motion sampling and trajectory-aligned loss constraints in diffusion processes to bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantics.

Result: T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and state-of-the-art methods in ultra-low bitrate scenarios and achieves more precise motion control than text-guided approaches.

Conclusion: T-GVC introduces a new direction for generative video coding by leveraging geometric motion modeling, offering better performance and motion accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies age-related bias in deep learning-based FER systems, identifies disparities in recognition and attention for elderly individuals, and proposes three mitigation strategies showing improved accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address demographic biases, especially age-related, in FER systems, ensuring fairness and reliability for underrepresented groups like the elderly.

Method: Investigates recognition performance across age groups, uses XAI to identify disparities, and evaluates three strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss on AffectNet dataset.

Result: Improved recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for error-prone expressions, with models attending to more relevant facial regions.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be mitigated with simple training modifications, and approximate demographic labels enhance fairness in affective computing.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MolCLIP combines cell video and molecular data to improve drug MoA recognition, outperforming previous methods by 51.2% and 20.5% in drug identification and MoA recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for MoA recognition focus on spatial cell images, neglecting temporal dynamics and molecular data.

Method: MolCLIP integrates microscopic cell videos and molecular data using a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework and metric learning.

Result: MolCLIP improves drug identification by 51.2% and MoA recognition by 20.5% on the MitoDataset.

Conclusion: Combining temporal cell dynamics and molecular data enhances MoA recognition, demonstrating MolCLIP's effectiveness.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARNet, a deep learning model for efficient keypoint annotation in cervical vertebrae radiographs to predict pediatric growth potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate growth potential estimation is crucial for pediatric orthodontic treatments, but manual annotation of cervical vertebrae is labor-intensive.

Method: ARNet uses an Interaction-guided recalibration network and morphology-aware loss to streamline keypoint annotation in lateral cephalometric radiographs.

Result: ARNet reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and shows strong performance across datasets.

Conclusion: ARNet advances pediatric orthodontics by providing an efficient AI-assisted tool for growth potential assessment.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-DFER, an AU-enhanced dynamic facial expression recognition architecture, integrating AU-expression knowledge to improve deep learning models. It outperforms SOTA methods and addresses label imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dynamic facial expression recognition by incorporating quantified AU-expression knowledge into deep learning models and tackling data label imbalance.

Method: Proposes AU-DFER, integrating AU knowledge via a weight matrix and AU loss, validated on existing models and datasets.

Result: AU-DFER outperforms SOTA methods without extra computation and improves results. Also addresses label imbalance effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating AU knowledge and redesigning loss functions enhances DFER, highlighting the importance of addressing data imbalance.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

*Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Kosuke Nishida,Daiki Chijiwa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationale-enhanced decoding (RED) to address the issue of LVLMs ignoring generated rationales in CoT reasoning, improving multi-modal reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs often ignore generated rationales in CoT reasoning, undermining grounding and accuracy.

Method: Re-formulates multi-modal CoT as KL-constrained reward maximization and proposes RED, a plug-and-play decoding strategy that harmonizes visual and rationale information.

Result: RED consistently improves reasoning over standard CoT and other methods across benchmarks and LVLMs.

Conclusion: RED enhances faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, advancing reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

TL;DR: Tree-Mamba improves underwater monocular depth estimation with adaptive tree-aware scanning and a new benchmark, BlueDepth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods fail in UMDE due to inflexible state scanning and unreliable depth labels in datasets.

Method: Proposes Tree-Mamba with a tree-aware scanning strategy and constructs the BlueDepth benchmark with reliable labels.

Result: Tree-Mamba outperforms leading methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba and BlueDepth advance UMDE by addressing feature modeling and dataset reliability.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

TL;DR: A method for local motion blur deblurring using a trainable mask predictor and intra-frame motion analyzer, reducing computation by 49% compared to SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deblurring methods inefficiently allocate resources and poorly handle spatially varying blur patterns.

Method: Proposes a trainable mask predictor to identify blurred regions and an intra-frame motion analyzer for adaptive blur restoration, with structural reparameterization for efficiency.

Result: Superior performance on local and global blur datasets, reducing FLOPs by 49% compared to LMD-ViT.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses local motion blur with computational efficiency, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: CrossVLAD is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models (VLMs), introducing CRAFT as an efficient attack method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security challenges in unified VLMs due to instruction-based control, requiring adversarial inputs to remain effective across unpredictable tasks.

Method: Introduces CrossVLAD, a dataset from MSCOCO with GPT-4 annotations, and CRAFT, a region-centric attack framework.

Result: CRAFT outperforms existing methods in cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates.

Conclusion: CRAFT effectively influences unified VLMs across diverse tasks, demonstrating superior adversarial transferability.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: A framework for scaling reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) for long videos using reinforcement learning, featuring a dataset, training pipeline, and efficient infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of long video reasoning in VLMs by integrating large-scale datasets, advanced training methods, and optimized infrastructure.

Method: Combines a two-stage training pipeline (CoT-SFT and RL) with Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP) for efficient long video processing.

Result: Achieves strong performance on benchmarks, outperforms competitors, and demonstrates scalability with input frames. MR-SP provides significant speedup.

Conclusion: A significant advancement in long video reasoning for VLMs, with publicly released training infrastructure supporting diverse modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it

TL;DR: TreeBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning, focusing on traceable evidence and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR, a training paradigm, improves performance on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack a holistic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning capabilities, prompting the creation of TreeBench.

Method: TreeBench is built on three principles: focused visual perception, traceable evidence, and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR uses reinforcement learning to jointly supervise localization and reasoning.

Result: TreeBench consists of 405 challenging QA pairs, with advanced models scoring below 60% accuracy. TreeVGR improves performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traceability is crucial for advancing vision-grounded reasoning, as demonstrated by TreeBench and TreeVGR.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

### [173] [Understanding Dataset Bias in Medical Imaging: A Case Study on Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07722)
*Ethan Dack,Chengliang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits the 'Name that dataset' task for chest X-ray datasets to explore bias, applying transformations to test robustness and using various network architectures on popular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if dataset bias exists in medical imaging datasets, given their sensitive nature and popularity in research, and to ensure AI methods focus on pathology rather than shortcuts.

Method: Applied simple dataset transformations to identify bias and tested with multiple network architectures on NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and PadChest datasets.

Result: Not explicitly stated, but the goal is to uncover bias and encourage explainable research in medical imaging.

Conclusion: The work aims to promote more open-source datasets and transparent research in medical imaging, with code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Théo Danielou,Daniel Tordjman,Pierre Manceron,Corentin Dancette*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simplified 3D promptable segmentation method is introduced to address the limitations of SAM in handling 3D medical imaging, reducing inference time and complexity while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's 2D architecture is unsuitable for 3D volumetric data like CT or MRI scans, and existing 3D methods are computationally intensive and complex.

Method: The proposed method simplifies 3D segmentation by eliminating sliding-window inference and prompt management complexities, inspired by SegVol.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced inference time and computational resource usage.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical solution for 3D medical imaging segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

*Xixi Liu,Ailin Deng,Christopher Zach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-based decoding method to reduce bias in 'Yes' answers and improve performance in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the imbalance in 'Yes' ratios in VLMs and mitigating object hallucination for safer deployment.

Method: Energy-based decoding dynamically selects hidden states from layers with minimal energy scores.

Result: Improves accuracy by 4.82% and reduces yes-ratio bias by 8.81% across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces bias and enhances performance in VLMs without complex modifications.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-rate two-stream spiking neural network (SNN) improves early human activity recognition, outperforming previous methods by 2% in accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early recognition of human activities is vital for safety and responsiveness in human-robot interactions, leveraging event-based vision sensors for low latency.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stream SNN that processes events at high rates, avoiding the limitations of traditional low-rate accumulation methods.

Result: The SNN achieves a 2% higher final accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset and demonstrates effectiveness in early action triggering for sports motion capture.

Conclusion: The proposed SNN framework advances early activity recognition, balancing speed and accuracy for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDST, a sparse-dense side-tuning architecture for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), addressing limitations of existing methods by focusing on sparse moment retrieval and enhancing context modeling with a novel attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VTG rely on final-layer features of frozen pre-trained backbones, limiting adaptability. Full fine-tuning is impractical, and prior side-tuning approaches overlook the sparse nature of moment retrieval.

Method: Proposes SDST, an anchor-free side-tuning architecture, and introduces Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention for better context modeling. Integrates InternVideo2 backbone into the framework.

Result: Significantly improves performance, achieving competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing parameters by up to 73%.

Conclusion: SDST is a parameter-efficient and effective solution for VTG, outperforming existing methods with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

*Charlie Budd,Silvère Ségaud,Matthew Elliot,Graeme Stasiuk,Yijing Xie,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-RAFT improves fluorescence-guided neurosurgery by enabling cross-modal image correspondence between hyperspectral images under different lighting, reducing errors by 36.6% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical decision-making with real-time quantitative fluorescence measurements requires accurate cross-modal image alignment in dynamic environments.

Method: X-RAFT modifies RAFT for cross-modal inputs, using distinct encoders per modality and self-supervised fine-tuning with flow-cycle-consistency.

Result: X-RAFT reduces errors by 36.6% compared to baselines and 27.83% over CrossRAFT.

Conclusion: X-RAFT effectively addresses cross-modal correspondence challenges, promising improved surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method improves geometric accuracy in additive manufacturing by comparing CAD and XCT volumes, outperforming traditional DVC methods with faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric inaccuracies in additive manufacturing can compromise component performance, but current DVC methods struggle with registration and large data sizes.

Method: Uses deep learning and dynamic patch-based processing to estimate voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes, introducing a Binary Difference Map for evaluation.

Result: Achieves a 9.2% improvement in Dice Score and 9.9% in voxel match rate, reducing processing time from days to minutes.

Conclusion: The method enhances AM reliability and efficiency, paving the way for closed-loop compensation in production.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOOTER is a framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks, providing guidelines, tools, and a benchmark dataset to assess imperceptibility through human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defenses against adversarial attacks rely on norm-bounded constraints, but unrestricted attacks bypass these, requiring human evaluation for imperceptibility. Existing work lacks statistical rigor, necessitating a unified framework.

Method: Introduces SCOOTER, a framework with guidelines for crowd studies, tools for annotation collection, and a benchmark dataset. Conducts large-scale human vs. model comparisons.

Result: Human evaluations showed that tested attacks (color-space and diffusion-based) failed to produce imperceptible images. GPT-4o was inconsistent in detecting adversarial examples.

Conclusion: Automated vision systems misalign with human perception, highlighting the need for SCOOTER as a benchmark for unrestricted adversarial attack evaluation.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates calibration techniques for image classification under dataset shift, comparing post-hoc and in-training methods. Key findings include the effectiveness of entropy regularization with label smoothing, robustness of post-hoc calibrators exposed to OOD data, and the trade-off between in-distribution and shifted calibration. Ensembling and finetuning foundation models yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide practical guidelines for robust calibration under real-world dataset shifts in image classification.

Method: Comparison of post-hoc and in-training calibration methods across eight classification tasks and various natural shifts. Analysis includes entropy regularization, label smoothing, OOD exposure, and ensembling effects.

Result: Best calibration under shift comes from combining entropy regularization and label smoothing. Post-hoc calibrators with OOD exposure are robust. Ensembling and finetuning foundation models improve calibration robustness.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable insights for practitioners, highlighting the effectiveness of specific techniques and trade-offs in calibration under dataset shift.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D vision-language research lacks focus on spatial reasoning, with datasets often mixing semantic cues, leading to superficial model interpretations.

Method: The authors create S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset with 200k+ vision-language pairs and 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries, deliberately excluding object names to mitigate biases.

Result: Benchmarks show state-of-the-art methods struggle with the dataset, highlighting its value for advancing spatially aware AI.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D and the 3D-SRS benchmark aim to improve AI's spatial reasoning, supporting embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG models lack accuracy, robustness, and generalization in complex scenarios.

Method: Uses 3D CNNs, differential frame fusion, Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention, and a dynamic hybrid loss function.

Result: Achieved MAE of 7.58 on MMPD test set, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed network demonstrates superior robustness and generalization, especially in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT introduces instance-aware prompts for vision transformers, combining them with dataset-level prompts using PCA, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VPT uses fixed dataset-level prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance due to dataset variance.

Method: ViaPT generates instance-aware prompts per input, fuses them with dataset-level prompts using PCA, and balances dataset and instance knowledge.

Result: ViaPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 34 datasets, reducing parameters compared to VPT-Deep.

Conclusion: ViaPT establishes a new paradigm for optimizing visual prompts, balancing instance and dataset knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

*Zhihui Zhang,Luanyuan Dai,Qika Lin,Yunfeng Diao,Guangyin Jin,Yufei Guo,Jing Zhang,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergistic Prompting (SyP), a framework for robust visual recognition with missing modalities, addressing limitations of static prompts and basic prompt-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adapt to varying missing-data conditions and struggle with reliable performance when critical modalities are missing.

Method: SyP uses a Dynamic Adapter for adaptive prompt generation and a Synergistic Prompting Strategy to balance information across modalities.

Result: SyP outperforms existing methods on three datasets, showing robustness under diverse missing rates.

Conclusion: SyP effectively handles missing modalities, offering superior adaptability and reliability.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

TL;DR: The study introduces a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based markerless approach for forecasting lung tumor motion in proton therapy, comparing patient-specific and multi-patient training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tumor motion forecasting is crucial for precise proton therapy, yet transformer-based architectures remain unexplored in this domain despite their success in trajectory forecasting.

Method: Two training strategies (patient-specific and multi-patient) were evaluated using DRRs from 31 patients. Performance was measured using ADE and FDE on planning and treatment data.

Result: Patient-specific models performed better on planning data, but multi-patient models showed robustness to anatomical variability and comparable performance on treatment data without retraining.

Conclusion: ViT-based markerless forecasting is feasible, with patient-specific models offering precision and multi-patient models providing robustness for clinical use.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

*Richard Dirauf,Florian Wolz,Dario Zanca,Björn Eskofier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of content-based puzzle solvers under corruptions like missing pieces and eroded edges, finding deep learning models, especially Positional Diffusion, adapt well with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current puzzle solvers lack realistic challenges for real-world applications like artefact reassembly, prompting an investigation into their robustness under corruptions.

Method: Introduces three corruption types (missing pieces, eroded edges, eroded contents) and evaluates heuristic and deep learning-based solvers.

Result: Standard solvers decline rapidly with corruption, but deep learning models improve robustness via fine-tuning; Positional Diffusion excels.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of deep learning for real-world artefact reconstruction and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

*Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Dingyou Wang,Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yu Wu,Guanbin Li,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCIS is a new baseline for class-incremental image segmentation (CIS) that addresses plasticity loss and data-order reliance by leveraging highly aggregated image features for query alignment and introducing cross-stage consistency and visual query replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoupled frameworks for CIS suffer from plasticity loss and heavy reliance on input data order.

Method: SimCIS directly selects image features for query assignment to ensure perfect alignment and introduces cross-stage consistency and a visual query replay mechanism.

Result: SimCIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders.

Conclusion: SimCIS is a simple yet effective solution for CIS, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made

*Paul McHard,Florent P. Audonnet,Oliver Summerell,Sebastian Andraos,Paul Henderson,Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for high-precision 3D anomaly detection, addressing the lack of realistic datasets in manufacturing defect detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defects significantly reduce manufacturing yield, but current datasets are inadequate for real-world scenarios, limiting the development of effective defect detection methods.

Method: The authors created 3D-ADAM, comprising 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 unique parts, with 27,346 annotated defects and 8,110 machine element features, captured in real industrial conditions.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models shows the dataset's challenge, and an expert survey confirms its industrial relevance and quality.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM aims to advance robust 3D anomaly detection models for modern manufacturing by providing a realistic benchmark.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: THUNDER is a benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, enabling efficient comparison of 23 models on 16 datasets, focusing on performance, feature analysis, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing progress in digital pathology is challenging due to many concurrent methods. A benchmark is needed to evaluate performance, differences, uncertainty, and robustness.

Method: THUNDER is introduced as a dynamic, easy-to-use benchmark supporting diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness assessment.

Result: Comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16 datasets, with public code available.

Conclusion: THUNDER provides a reliable tool for evaluating digital pathology models, emphasizing performance, robustness, and feature insights.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

TL;DR: SLURPP combines latent diffusion models with scene decomposition for efficient underwater image restoration, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater image restoration methods are computationally intensive and produce artifacts in complex scenes.

Method: SLURPP integrates pretrained latent diffusion models with explicit scene decomposition and uses a physics-based synthetic data pipeline for training.

Result: SLURPP is 200X faster than existing methods and improves PSNR by ~3 dB on synthetic benchmarks, with better real-world performance.

Conclusion: SLURPP advances underwater image restoration by balancing efficiency and accuracy, validated on synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The MIRA framework improves factual accuracy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for medical diagnosis by optimizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic context adjustment and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce factually inconsistent responses in medical diagnosis, and RAG, while helpful, faces challenges like insufficient/excessive retrieval and over-reliance on retrieved data.

Method: MIRA introduces a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module and a medical RAG framework with image embeddings and a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning.

Result: MIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks, enhancing factual accuracy.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively balances internal knowledge and external references, improving MLLM reliability in medical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an embedded, unsupervised architecture for feature point detection and description using a quantized SuperPoint CNN, optimized for FPGA SoC platforms to achieve high-speed processing with minimal computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate position estimation is crucial for autonomous navigation systems, and VSLAM relies on reliable feature extraction. The goal is to minimize computational demands while maintaining high detection quality for resource-limited platforms.

Method: The proposed method involves a quantized SuperPoint CNN, implemented on an FPGA SoC (AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+), using Brevitas and FINN for model quantization and hardware-aware optimization. Performance was evaluated on the TUM dataset.

Result: The solution processes 640x480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on the TUM dataset assessed the impact of quantization on accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: The embedded implementation successfully balances computational efficiency and detection quality, making it suitable for resource-limited platforms like mobile or embedded systems.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

*Xiao Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Can Liu,Houcheng Su,Weichen Guo,Jiyao Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy called CiCi is proposed for rPPG tasks, leveraging spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency in signals to enhance real-time adaptation without source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods for rPPG face limitations in privacy and real-time adaptation, prompting the need for a TTA approach.

Method: The CiCi framework integrates expert knowledge of spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency, with a gradient control mechanism for stable adaptation.

Result: Experiments on five datasets show CiCi outperforms existing methods in real-time self-supervised adaptation.

Conclusion: CiCi offers state-of-the-art performance for rPPG tasks, enabling effective real-world deployment without source data access.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

TL;DR: A real-time ID algorithm for tracking mice in home cages using custom ear tags and camera monitoring improves data accuracy and animal welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous monitoring of mice is challenging due to housing density, similar appearances, and high mobility. Accurate ID assignment is needed for better data collection and welfare.

Method: Developed a pipeline with a custom tracker (MouseTracks), a transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer), and a tracklet associator (MouseMap) to assign IDs at 30 fps.

Result: The pipeline improves tracking efficiency and reduces ID switches across mouse strains and environments compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables accurate, real-time monitoring of mice, enhancing research outcomes and animal welfare.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

TL;DR: A method for synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos using a data curation pipeline (M3arsSynth) and a video generator (MarsGen), outperforming terrestrial-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery necessitate a specialized solution for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation.

Method: Proposes M3arsSynth for 3D Martian environment reconstruction from stereo images and MarsGen for video synthesis, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data.

Result: Outperforms terrestrial-trained models in visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: The approach enables realistic Martian video synthesis, aiding mission preparation and simulation.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry Forcing improves video diffusion models by aligning their representations with 3D geometric features, enhancing visual quality and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models lack geometric-aware structure, limiting their ability to represent the 3D world accurately.

Method: Proposes Geometry Forcing, using Angular and Scale Alignment to align diffusion model features with a pretrained geometric foundation model.

Result: Significantly improves visual quality and 3D consistency in video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing effectively bridges the gap between video diffusion models and 3D world understanding.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: OST-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Online Spatio-Temporal understanding in MLLMs, highlighting challenges in dynamic reasoning and memory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of online, dynamic reasoning in embodied perception, which OST-Bench addresses.

Method: OST-Bench uses 1.4k scenes and 10k QA pairs from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes to test MLLMs under online settings.

Result: Leading MLLMs struggle with complex spatio-temporal reasoning, showing declining accuracy as exploration and memory demands increase.

Conclusion: OST-Bench reveals key challenges in online embodied reasoning, providing a resource for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

TL;DR: The paper investigates why CLIP models fail to learn binding (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs) and identifies data properties as the key issue, not batch size or hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models struggle with binding tasks (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs), and previous fixes like hard negatives or architecture changes were insufficient. The paper aims to uncover the role of data properties in this limitation.

Method: The study uses a synthetic dataset to rigorously analyze how data properties (e.g., attribute density, caption completeness, saliency bias) affect CLIP's binding performance.

Result: Common natural data properties (low attribute density, incomplete captions, saliency bias) harm binding. Scaling batch size or adding hard negatives doesn't help; only data with specific properties enables reliable binding.

Conclusion: Data properties, not training tricks, are critical for CLIP to learn binding. Addressing these properties in datasets could improve CLIP's performance on binding tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

### [201] [Multi-Granular Spatio-Temporal Token Merging for Training-Free Acceleration of Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07990)
*Jeongseok Hyun,Sukjun Hwang,Su Ho Han,Taeoh Kim,Inwoong Lee,Dongyoon Wee,Joon-Young Lee,Seon Joo Kim,Minho Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STTM is a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method for video LLMs, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy by exploiting local redundancy in video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face quadratic computational scaling with token count, limiting efficiency. STTM addresses this by leveraging overlooked spatial and temporal redundancy.

Method: STTM transforms frames into multi-granular spatial tokens via quadtree search, then merges tokens temporally. It is query-agnostic and allows KV cache reuse.

Result: STTM achieves 2× speed-up with 0.5% accuracy drop (50% token budget) and 3× speed-up with 2% drop (30% budget), outperforming existing methods on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: STTM efficiently reduces computational cost in video LLMs by merging tokens, maintaining high accuracy and enabling KV cache reuse.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

*Weihao Xia,Cengiz Oztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASIC, a unified evaluation framework for brain visual decoding, addressing limitations of coarse metrics by focusing on structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding lack granularity, neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained distinctions, necessitating a more comprehensive framework.

Method: BASIC uses hierarchical segmentation-based metrics for structural fidelity and multimodal large language models for semantic-level comparisons, benchmarking diverse decoding methods.

Result: The framework provides discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive evaluation of brain visual decoding methods.

Conclusion: BASIC offers a more robust and detailed foundation for assessing visual decoding methods, enhancing interpretability and scalability.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for keypoint detection in few-shot learning using sketches, overcoming cross-modal and style challenges with prototypical adaptation and grid-based localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of source data in few-shot keypoint detection by leveraging sketches as a source-free alternative.

Method: Uses a prototypical setup, grid-based locator, and prototypical domain adaptation to handle cross-modal embeddings and user-specific sketch styles.

Result: Demonstrates success in few-shot convergence for novel keypoints and classes through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in few-shot keypoint detection using sketches.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

*Shivam Duggal,Sanghyun Byun,William T. Freeman,Antonio Torralba,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KARL is a single-pass adaptive tokenizer inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity, predicting token counts for images in one forward pass, matching performance of multi-pass methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length representations ignore input complexity variations. Adaptive tokenizers require test-time search, which KARL avoids by predicting token counts in a single pass.

Method: KARL uses a single-pass approach to predict token halting based on reconstruction quality, trained similarly to Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning.

Result: KARL matches adaptive tokenizers' performance in one pass, with scaling laws analyzed for encoder/decoder size and tokenization types.

Conclusion: KARL aligns with Algorithmic Information Theory, showing intuitive complexity predictions for images, and offers efficient single-pass tokenization.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces \NickName, a method to enhance VQ-VAEs by improving codebook representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To narrow the performance gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs by improving quantization strategies and minimizing information loss.

Method: Retains latent dimensions and uses sub-codebooks for quantization, evaluated on 512p and 2k zero-shot benchmarks.

Result: \NickName outperforms existing methods, achieving superior rFID and PSNR scores on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method advances VQ-VAEs, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality and potential for HD image processing.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD
image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available at

*Helen Qu,Sang Michael Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how word co-occurrence statistics in CLIP/LMM pretraining data affect compositional generalization, showing strong correlations between PMI and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how concept combinations in training data impact the performance of CLIP and LMMs, especially for uncommon pairings.

Method: Uses PMI to measure co-occurrence frequencies and tests accuracy on synthetic and edited natural images.

Result: Strong correlation between PMI and accuracy (r=0.97 for synthetic images, r=0.75 for natural images), with similar effects in LMMs.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better algorithms to improve compositional generalization without scaling training data combinatorially.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

### [207] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cognitive biases in LLMs, attributing them mainly to pretraining rather than finetuning or randomness, using a two-step causal approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sources of cognitive biases in LLMs, distinguishing between pretraining, finetuning, and training randomness.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) finetuning models with different seeds to assess randomness, and (2) cross-tuning by swapping instruction datasets to isolate bias sources.

Result: Biases are primarily shaped by pretraining; models with the same backbone show similar bias patterns, more so than those sharing finetuning data.

Conclusion: Understanding biases in finetuned LLMs requires considering pretraining origins, guiding future strategies for bias evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the reliability of LLMs in social science surveys, revealing their susceptibility to response biases like recency bias and sensitivity to question perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness and biases of LLMs when used as proxies for human subjects in normative surveys.

Method: Tested nine LLMs on World Values Survey questions, applying 11 perturbations to phrasing and answer options, resulting in 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: LLMs exhibit recency bias and sensitivity to semantic variations; larger models are more robust but still affected by combined perturbations.

Conclusion: Prompt design and robustness testing are crucial when using LLMs for synthetic survey data due to their alignment with human response biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for evaluating synthetic text across multiple dimensions, including utility, fairness, privacy risks, and expert feedback, with a focus on high-stakes domains like healthcare and law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for principled evaluations of synthetic text to ensure its viability and privacy-preservation in AI development.

Method: Provides a toolkit (SynthTextEval) for comprehensive evaluations, including downstream utility, fairness, privacy leakage risks, distributional differences, and expert feedback.

Result: Demonstrates functionality and effectiveness in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law.

Conclusion: Aims to standardize evaluations to enhance synthetic text viability and privacy in AI.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a safety evaluation protocol for medical LLMs, addressing gaps in domain-specific safety assessments and proposing a benchmark (PatientSafetyBench) for patient-centric safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of LLMs in medical applications raises safety concerns, especially due to diverse user roles (patients, clinicians) and potential health impacts. Existing evaluations lack domain-specific focus.

Method: The authors develop a tailored safety evaluation protocol for medical LLMs, including a benchmark (PatientSafetyBench) with 466 samples across 5 categories. They apply red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection.

Result: The study establishes the first safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs, considering patient, clinician, and general user perspectives, and provides a foundation for safer deployment.

Conclusion: This work bridges a critical gap in medical LLM safety evaluation, offering a structured approach to ensure safer integration in healthcare.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes interruption detection in collaborative learning, proposing a robust method for identifying interruptions in noisy, multi-group settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting interruptions in classrooms with overlapping speech, where traditional single-conversation methods fail.

Method: Developed a state-of-the-art interruption identification method resilient to overlapping speech, leveraging linguistic and prosodic cues.

Result: Created a robust interruption detection system suitable for classroom deployment, with insights into interruption patterns in group interactions.

Conclusion: The work advances interruption detection in noisy environments and sets a foundation for future research on multi-group dialogue tracking.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating counterspeech rely on limited evidence and lack control over outputs, prompting the need for a more robust framework.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent framework combining static and dynamic evidence to enhance relevance and accuracy in counterspeech generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy; human evaluations confirm refinement boosts quality.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates high-quality counterspeech, validated by ablation studies and human preference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

TL;DR: A novel model combining GNNs and CNNs with real-time graph generation is introduced to improve efficiency in processing long texts, outperforming traditional Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are inefficient for long texts due to quadratic computational complexity. This study aims to address this by proposing a more efficient architecture.

Method: The model integrates GNNs and CNNs with a real-time graph generation mechanism, uses LLM information, and employs small-world graphs for document-level aggregation.

Result: The model shows meaningful semantic organization (clustering coefficient ~0.45, shortest path length 4-5) and competitive performance in text classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed model is efficient and effective for long-text processing, offering a viable alternative to Transformers.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl is a framework for improving AI-generated healthcare content by controlling readability without losing meaning, outperforming GPT-4 in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective human-AI communication in healthcare requires personalized and understandable content, which current models struggle with.

Method: MedReadCtrl uses readability-controlled instruction tuning to adjust output complexity while preserving medical intent.

Result: MedReadCtrl outperforms GPT-4 in readability and task performance, with experts preferring it, especially for low-literacy users.

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl offers a scalable solution for equitable AI-enabled healthcare by making clinical content more accessible.

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

*Matthieu Boileau,Philippe Helluy,Jeremy Pawlus,Svitlana Vyetrenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores distilling time series reasoning into small language models using synthetic data and natural language annotations, achieving interpretable results suitable for lightweight deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build interpretable time series foundation models by transferring reasoning capabilities to compact, instruction-tuned language models.

Method: Uses a synthetic dataset of mean-reverting time series with varied trends and noise, generates annotations via a large multimodal model, and fine-tunes compact Qwen models.

Result: Post-trained models show meaningful interpretive capabilities in trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of compressing time series understanding into lightweight, interpretable models for practical deployment.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [217] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SAND framework to improve LLM agents by enabling deliberation over candidate actions, outperforming existing methods by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent tuning methods may lead to suboptimal actions due to limited exploration of alternatives.

Method: SAND uses self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided critique for step-wise deliberation, finetuning the LLM agent iteratively.

Result: SAND achieves a 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: SAND effectively enhances LLM agent performance by promoting deliberate action selection.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLEP is a two-phase RL framework for language models that replays verified trajectories to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training RL for large language models is unstable and energy-intensive, with policies drifting from pretrained weights.

Method: RLEP collects verified trajectories and replays them during training, blending new rollouts with replayed successes.

Result: RLEP achieves faster convergence and better performance, improving accuracy on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLEP enhances RL training efficiency and effectiveness, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'machine bullshit' as a framework to study LLMs' indifference to truth, proposing the Bullshit Index and a taxonomy of four bullshit forms. Empirical results show RLHF worsens bullshit, and CoT prompting amplifies specific forms, with political contexts favoring weasel words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs by conceptualizing and quantifying 'machine bullshit' as an overarching framework.

Method: Introduces the Bullshit Index and a taxonomy of four bullshit forms (empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, unverified claims). Evaluates using datasets like Marketplace, Political Neutrality, and BullshitEval (2,400 scenarios).

Result: RLHF fine-tuning exacerbates bullshit; CoT prompting amplifies empty rhetoric and paltering. Political contexts show prevalent weasel words.

Conclusion: Highlights AI alignment challenges and provides insights for more truthful LLM behavior.

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

*Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Xin Liu,Yiwen Song,Mingyang Ling,Chitta Baral,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING improves smaller LLMs by distilling planning trajectories from larger models and fine-tuning with supervised and reinforcement learning, boosting performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller open-source LLMs lack exploration of planning structures post-training, despite their potential to enhance reasoning.

Method: PLAN-TUNING distills synthetic task decompositions (planning trajectories) from large LLMs and fine-tunes smaller models using supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives.

Result: Plan-tuned models outperform baselines by ~7% on GSM8k and MATH, and show ~10-12% improvements on out-of-domain datasets like OlympiadBench and AIME 2024.

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING effectively enhances complex reasoning in smaller LLMs by leveraging planning trajectories.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeaR improves LLM reasoning by guiding models through code-related tasks with curated data and reinforcement learning, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reasoning in LLMs by avoiding over-reliance on complex code structures and focusing on core reasoning.

Method: TeaR uses data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths.

Result: Achieves 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B across 17 benchmarks.

Conclusion: TeaR effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs by refining reasoning paths and avoiding algorithmic overfitting.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

*Hein Htet,Amgad Ahmed Ali Ibrahim,Yutaka Sasaki,Ryoji Asahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study proposes using NER and RE with DyGIE++ and BERT variants (MatSciBERT, PubMedBERT) to extract ORR catalyst data from literature, achieving high accuracy with domain-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured ORR catalyst information from complex literature is challenging, necessitating automated methods.

Method: Uses DyGIE++ with BERT variants for NER and RE, fine-tuned on a manually annotated dataset (FC-CoMIcs).

Result: PubMedBERT achieves 82.19% NER F1-score; MatSciBERT attains 66.10% RE F1-score, outperforming general models.

Conclusion: Domain-specific BERT models are reliable for scalable ORR catalyst extraction, showing potential for automated literature analysis.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limits of transformer-based LLMs, focusing on their inability to handle tasks beyond certain computational complexities and their failure to verify task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the boundaries of LLM capabilities, especially regarding hallucinations and agentic tasks, given their growing real-world applications.

Method: Analyzes the computational complexity of LLM inference, providing examples of tasks beyond their capability and their inability to verify accuracy.

Result: LLMs cannot perform or verify tasks exceeding specific computational complexities.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical limitations of LLMs in complex computational and agentic tasks, with implications for their real-world use.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

*Yuanchen Shi,Longyin Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for creating a Chinese psychological support dialogue dataset (CPsDD) using large language models (Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier) and expert knowledge. The system (CADSS) includes profiling, summarizing, planning, and empathetic response generation, achieving top performance in strategy prediction and emotional support tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of non-English psychological support datasets by leveraging limited real-world data and expert knowledge.

Method: Fine-tune two models (Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier) to create and refine dialogues, then build CPsDD. CADSS integrates profiling, summarization, planning, and response generation.

Result: CPsDD contains 68K dialogues across diverse categories. CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on CPsDD and ESConv datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses dataset scarcity and enhances psychological support systems, demonstrating superior performance in key tasks.

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study extends voice activity projection (VAP) to triadic conversations, showing improved performance over dyadic baselines, with conversation type affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in turn-taking studies by applying VAP to triadic multi-party scenarios, which are less explored than dyadic settings.

Method: Trained multiple VAP models on a Japanese triadic dataset, focusing on predicting future voice activity using acoustic data.

Result: Triadic VAP models outperformed baselines, though accuracy varied with conversation type.

Conclusion: VAP is viable for triadic turn-taking, paving the way for integration into spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can outperform fine-tuned smaller models in multilingual subjectivity detection, achieving top rankings in the CheckThat! 2025 task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs in multilingual subjectivity detection, especially in noisy or low-quality data settings, and compare them to fine-tuned smaller models.

Method: Used few-shot prompting with LLMs, experimenting with advanced techniques like debating LLMs and example selection strategies, but found standard few-shot prompts most effective.

Result: Achieved top rankings in multiple languages, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot learning is effective and adaptable for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a robust alternative to traditional fine-tuning, especially with scarce or inconsistent labeled data.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in domain-specific settings, revealing retrieval as a bottleneck, and proposes a strategy to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on generation and open-domain benchmarks, hiding retrieval challenges. This study addresses the gap by examining Arabic-English RAG in real-world corporate datasets.

Method: The study uses benchmarks with varied language combinations for queries and documents, analyzing multilingual retrieval behavior. A retrieval strategy enforces equal retrieval from both languages.

Result: Retrieval is a bottleneck in cross-lingual scenarios, with performance drops when query and document languages differ. The proposed strategy improves cross-lingual and overall performance.

Conclusion: The findings highlight opportunities for enhancing multilingual retrieval in practical RAG applications, emphasizing the retriever's role in cross-lingual performance.

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the roles of long-CoT SFT and RL in VLMs, finding SFT aids complex reasoning but harms simpler tasks, while RL improves generalization. Combining them fails to yield additive benefits, revealing a 'synergy dilemma.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL in VLMs, as their joint effectiveness is uncertain despite synergy in language-only models.

Method: Systematic investigation across multimodal reasoning benchmarks, comparing SFT and RL individually and in combination through various training strategies.

Result: SFT improves complex reasoning but introduces verbosity and harms simpler tasks; RL enhances generalization and brevity. Combining them leads to trade-offs without additive benefits.

Conclusion: The 'synergy dilemma' calls for more adaptive approaches to fully leverage combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing generalization challenges in DIMT due to limited training data and complex visual-textual interplay.

Method: Aligns an image-only encoder with MLLM's multimodal representations, leveraging pre-training on large-scale document datasets.

Result: Significant improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and complex scenarios.

Conclusion: M4Doc efficiently enhances DIMT performance while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uncovers a Bayesian foundation in discrete-diffusion language models, showing that denoiser outputs under forward masking align with the posterior over clean tokens. It introduces a lightweight ensemble method for improved performance and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete-diffusion models and Bayesian principles, enabling better performance and uncertainty quantification without additional training.

Method: Monte Carlo marginalization over K corruptions to approximate the posterior, combined with an inference-time ensemble averaging K mask-and-denoise passes.

Result: Achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8 on WikiText-2, outperforming GPT-2 Small (20.3) with comparable model size.

Conclusion: The method provides a consistent, efficient way to leverage Bayesian principles in discrete-diffusion models, enhancing performance and uncertainty awareness.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

TL;DR: LLMs can be compressed via Knowledge Distillation (KD) for QA tasks, retaining 90% performance while reducing parameters by 57.1%. One-shot prompting further improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally expensive, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments. This work explores KD to compress LLMs for QA tasks.

Method: Evaluate student models distilled from Pythia and Qwen2.5 on SQuAD and MLQA benchmarks under zero-shot and one-shot prompting.

Result: Student models retain over 90% of teacher performance with up to 57.1% fewer parameters. One-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot.

Conclusion: KD with minimal prompting enables efficient, high-performing QA systems for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

### [232] [FrugalRAG: Learning to retrieve and reason for multi-hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07634)
*Abhinav Java,Srivathsan Koundinyan,Nagarajan Natarajan,Amit Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large-scale fine-tuning in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and shows improved efficiency in retrieval searches with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked efficiency metric (number of retrieval searches) in RAG systems, while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: The method involves using a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts and demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised and RL-based fine-tuning for frugality.

Result: Results show competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the retrieval cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like HotPotQA.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that large-scale fine-tuning is unnecessary for improving RAG metrics, and frugality can be achieved with minimal training.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

*Haotan Guo,Jianfei He,Jiayuan Ma,Hongbin Na,Zimu Wang,Haiyang Zhang,Qi Chen,Wei Wang,Zijing Shi,Tao Shen,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) in Chinese content moderation, presents a dataset of real-world examples, benchmarks LLMs, and proposes a Pinyin-based prompting solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCR is a growing challenge in Chinese content moderation, but existing evaluations lack realism by ignoring user creativity.

Method: The study organizes PCR into a taxonomy, compiles a dataset of 500 real posts, benchmarks LLMs, and tests Pinyin-based prompting.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly (F1-score 0.672), but Pinyin-based prompting improves accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a PCR taxonomy, a realistic benchmark, and a lightweight mitigation technique for toxicity detection.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

### [234] [An Automated Length-Aware Quality Metric for Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07653)
*Andrew D. Foland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOIR is a metric for evaluating summarization quality by balancing semantic retention and length compression, correlating with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the evaluation of summarization quality without relying on human-generated references, addressing the recall-compression tradeoff.

Method: Uses a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity and combines it with summary length compression.

Result: NOIR effectively captures the tradeoff between token-length and semantic retention, aligning with human perception.

Conclusion: NOIR provides an automated, versatile tool for assessing and improving summarization tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS), a method to simulate more attention heads and larger hidden dimensions without increasing parameters, improving Transformer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observing that multi-head attention (MHA) improves with more heads and larger hidden sizes, the authors aim to achieve similar gains without parameter overhead.

Method: SAS projects low-dimensional head representations into higher-dimensional spaces, simulating larger models. Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) controls parameter costs.

Result: Experiments show SAS outperforms other attention variants across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: SAS effectively enhances Transformer performance by simulating larger models while maintaining compact size.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: K2RAG is a novel framework combining dense/sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and summarization to enhance RAG's efficiency and accuracy in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the resource-intensive fine-tuning of LLMs and scalability/accuracy limitations of naive RAG implementations.

Method: Integrates dense/sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization; includes preprocessing for faster training.

Result: Achieved 0.57 mean answer similarity, 0.82 Q3 similarity, 93% faster training, 40% faster execution, and 3x less VRAM usage.

Conclusion: K2RAG significantly improves RAG's efficiency, accuracy, and scalability for knowledge expansion in LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vec2Text's ability to reconstruct original texts from embeddings, confirming its effectiveness but highlighting limitations and proposing defenses like quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify Vec2Text's claims about reconstructing texts from embeddings and explore privacy risks and defenses.

Method: Reproduced Vec2Text framework, validated claims, extended experiments (parameter sensitivity, sensitive input reconstruction, embedding quantization).

Result: Vec2Text works well under ideal conditions but is sensitive to sequence length; quantization and noise mitigate privacy risks.

Conclusion: Text embeddings pose privacy risks; defenses like quantization are needed, and further research is crucial.

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: Selective alignment strategy for LLMs prioritizes high-impact tokens using token-level log-probability differences, reducing computational cost and improving alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not all tokens equally impact model performance; optimizing alignment efficiency is crucial.

Method: Selective-DPO focuses on high-impact tokens via log-probability differences between current policy and reference model.

Result: Outperforms standard DPO and distillation baselines on Arena-Hard and MT-Bench.

Conclusion: Token-level optimization and reference model quality are key for effective LLM alignment.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: To unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs in LLMs for legal applications, addressing gaps in reasoning, retrieval, and ethical concerns.

Method: Proposes a novel taxonomy integrating legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies, leveraging Transformer-based LLMs with innovations like sparse attention and mixture-of-experts architectures.

Result: Documents progress in task generalization, reasoning formalization, and workflow integration, while identifying challenges like explainability deficits and jurisdictional adaptation.

Conclusion: Provides a technical roadmap and conceptual framework for future legal AI, emphasizing low-resource systems, multimodal integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni proposes a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) with speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to handle streaming speech translation (StreamST) without relying on segmentation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing StreamST methods rely on sentence-level segments (SimulST) and struggle with policy learning due to limited context and cross-lingual complexity.

Method: StreamUni integrates speech CoT to guide the LSLM for multi-stage outputs, enabling simultaneous segmentation, policy decision, and translation. A streaming CoT training method enhances low-latency capabilities.

Result: StreamUni achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

Conclusion: StreamUni effectively addresses the challenges of StreamST by unifying segmentation, policy, and translation in a single model, reducing reliance on external segmentation and policy-specific training.

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae, enabling continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning by ensuring semantically consistent and invertible embeddings of logic formulae.

Method: Train a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert STL embeddings, using a small vocabulary from STL syntax.

Result: The model generates valid formulae quickly (1 epoch) and generalizes to logic semantics (~10 epochs), producing simpler yet semantically close formulae.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively captures semantic information, generalizes out-of-distribution, and solves requirement mining tasks by optimizing in the semantic space.

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on attention heads, but this study investigates repetition neurons to understand their role in ICL performance.

Method: Experiments analyze the relationship between repetition neurons and ICL, comparing their effects to induction heads.

Result: Repetition neurons' impact on ICL varies by layer depth; strategies to reduce repetitive outputs while preserving ICL are identified.

Conclusion: Repetition neurons play a nuanced role in ICL, and their management can improve LLM performance without sacrificing learning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

*Anwoy Chatterjee,H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala,Sumit Bhatia,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT), a method to optimize loss functions in instruction tuning by differentially weighting prompt and response tokens, outperforming conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked issue of optimizing loss functions in instruction tuning, questioning the conventional auto-regressive objective's effectiveness.

Method: The method involves systematically investigating the impact of weighting prompt and response tokens differently and proposing WIT as an alternative.

Result: Experiments show conventional tuning is suboptimal; WIT with balanced weights for prompt and response tokens improves performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The findings suggest rethinking instruction tuning loss and provide insights for developing more robust models, with open-sourced code available.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces conditional unigram tokenization, which aligns target token probabilities with source-language tokens. Evaluated on machine translation and language modeling, it shows mixed results: no translation improvement but reduced perplexity in language modeling. Data efficiency is a bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-lingual semantic alignment in tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens.

Method: Extends unigram tokenization by learning a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual alignment, using parallel data and a fixed source tokenizer.

Result: Mixed: no machine translation improvement, but consistent perplexity reduction in language modeling. Data efficiency is limited due to quadratic scaling.

Conclusion: Alternative parameterizations may be needed for practical cross-lingual tokenization due to data efficiency challenges.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

### [246] [From Ambiguity to Accuracy: The Transformative Effect of Coreference Resolution on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07847)
*Youngjoon Jang,Seongtae Hong,Junyoung Son,Sungjin Park,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how entity coreference impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, showing that coreference resolution improves retrieval and QA performance, especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coreferential complexity in RAG systems, which disrupts in-context learning and factual consistency.

Method: Systematic investigation of coreference effects on retrieval and generation, with comparative analysis of pooling strategies and QA tasks.

Result: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval and QA performance; mean pooling excels in context capture, and smaller models benefit more from disambiguation.

Conclusion: Coreference resolution is key to improving RAG systems, offering insights for better retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential

### [247] [Alpay Algebra V: Multi-Layered Semantic Games and Transfinite Fixed-Point Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07868)
*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture, formalizing AI-document alignment as a meta-game with nested sub-games, proving the existence of semantic equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge game-theoretic reasoning with fixed-point iteration in AI systems, ensuring natural emergence of equilibria without external imposition.

Method: Introduces a composite operator ϕ(⋅,γ(⋅)) for semantic convergence and sub-game resolution, supported by category theory and information theory.

Result: Proves a Game Theorem for semantic equilibria, with verification via Banach's theorem adaptations and novel ϕ-topology.

Conclusion: The framework is both theoretically sound and practically applicable, embodying its own 'semantic virus' concept in AI embedding spaces.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

*Xinyi Liu,Dachun Sun,Yi R. Fung,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Tarek Abdelzaher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocCHA is a confidence-aware, modular framework for clinical diagnosis, outperforming LLM baselines in accuracy and symptom recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CHAs are static and brittle, lacking adaptive reasoning and transparency, limiting their clinical applicability.

Method: DocCHA decomposes diagnosis into symptom elicitation, history acquisition, and causal graph construction, using interpretable confidence scores.

Result: DocCHA achieves 5.18% higher accuracy and 30% better symptom recall than LLM baselines, with minimal increase in dialogue turns.

Conclusion: DocCHA enables structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations, advancing trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

*Achuth Chandrasekhar,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated pipeline using LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash) and web automation streamlines MD simulation input file preparation, reducing errors and setup time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual preparation of MD simulation input files is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating automation.

Method: Integration of Gemini 2.0 Flash, Python scripting, and Selenium automates CHARMM GUI navigation and NAMD input file generation.

Result: The pipeline reduces setup time, minimizes errors, and scales for parallel processing of multiple protein systems.

Conclusion: This framework enhances MD simulation efficiency and demonstrates LLMs' potential in computational structural biology.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end

insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

*Guoxin Zang,Xue Li,Donglin Di,Lanshun Nie,Dechen Zhan,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE is a VLM-based framework for industrial anomaly detection, improving interpretability and generalization via Self-Guided Fact Enhancement and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with interpretable explanations and generalization in industrial anomaly detection due to domain-specific challenges.

Method: SAGE uses SFE for domain-specific knowledge integration and E-DPO for aligning outputs with expert preferences. It also introduces AD-PL, a dataset for anomaly reasoning.

Result: SAGE outperforms on industrial anomaly datasets in zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Conclusion: SAGE addresses limitations of VLMs in industrial anomaly detection, offering a robust framework with improved reasoning and performance.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

### [252] [MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957)
*Yu Wang,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRIX is a modular, multi-agent memory system for AI that enhances memory capabilities by integrating diverse memory types and multimodal experiences, outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI memory solutions are limited in personalization, abstraction, and reliable recall, prompting the development of MIRIX to enable language models to truly remember.

Method: MIRIX uses six structured memory types (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, Knowledge Vault) and a multi-agent framework for dynamic control and coordination.

Result: MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than RAG on ScreenshotVQA and 85.4% on LOCOMO, setting a new performance standard.

Conclusion: MIRIX redefines AI memory with its modular, multimodal approach, validated by superior performance in demanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [253] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why implicit reward models (IM-RMs) generalize worse than explicit reward models (EX-RMs), attributing the gap to IM-RMs' reliance on superficial token-level cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the root cause of the generalization gap between IM-RMs and EX-RMs, despite their near-identical training setups.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis and experiments to compare IM-RMs and EX-RMs, focusing on their reliance on token-level cues and performance under distribution shifts.

Result: IM-RMs generalize worse due to their dependence on superficial token-level cues, even in-distribution, and the study disproves alternative hypotheses like generation difficulty.

Conclusion: Minor design choices in reward models significantly impact generalization, with IM-RMs underperforming due to their token-level bias.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

TL;DR: Smaller language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) outperform larger models in clinical decision-making for rheumatology, offering energy efficiency and local deployment, though expert oversight is still needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of language models in clinical decision-making, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings, while addressing the trade-offs between model size and performance.

Method: Evaluated smaller language models (SLMs) combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) against larger models for diagnostic and therapeutic performance in rheumatology.

Result: SLMs with RAG achieved higher performance than larger models, with lower energy usage and cost-efficient local deployment, but fell short of specialist-level accuracy.

Conclusion: SLMs with RAG are promising for clinical support in resource-limited settings, but expert oversight remains crucial due to their limitations in accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation methods for medical reasoning lack rigor and scalability, necessitating a robust benchmark.

Method: Introduces MedThink-Bench with 500 expert-annotated questions and LLM-w-Ref, a framework using fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: LLM-w-Ref correlates well with expert judgments; smaller models like MedGemma-27B outperform larger ones like OpenAI-o3.

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench enables rigorous evaluation of LLMs' medical reasoning, promoting safe clinical deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods in visual reasoning are limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets, restricting flexibility and interpretability.

Method: PyVision is an interactive, multi-turn framework that allows MLLMs to dynamically create, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to specific tasks.

Result: PyVision boosts performance significantly, e.g., +7.8% for GPT-4.1 on V* and +31.1% for Claude-4.0-Sonnet on VLMsAreBlind-mini.

Conclusion: Dynamic tooling enables models to invent tools, advancing agentic visual reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

*Alan Malek,Jiawei Ge,Nevena Lazic,Chi Jin,András György,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Frontier LLMs excel at complex tasks but fail on simple reasoning problems, highlighting issues with out-of-distribution generalization and systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study why state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with tasks easy for humans despite excelling at complex benchmarks.

Method: Created a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks and introduced the 'unpuzzles' dataset of trivialized math/logic puzzles.

Result: LLMs consistently fail on simple tasks due to statistical shortcuts, intermediate errors, and long-context processing issues. They also struggle with trivialized versions of puzzles they excel at.

Conclusion: Out-of-distribution generalization remains a challenge for LLMs, even for simple reasoning, and simplifying tasks doesn't guarantee better performance.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep learning approach for carotid artery segmentation in multi-sequence MRI, addressing plaque complexity and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery plaques in MRI is vital for atherosclerosis and stroke risk assessment, but challenges include complex plaque morphology and scarce labeled data.

Method: Proposes a two-network system: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation, using a multi-level multi-sequence U-Net and semi-supervised learning with consistency enforcement.

Result: Evaluated on 52 patients, the approach shows effectiveness, emphasizing fusion strategy importance and validated by expert assessment.

Conclusion: Fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning improve carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI applications.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning-based compression of XCT data using D-CNN and VQ-VAE, evaluating their impact on data quality and proposing an edge-sensitive metric for improved analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient storage solutions for large imaging datasets due to advancements in imaging technologies.

Method: Used D-CNN and VQ-VAE with varying compression rates on sandstone XCT data, comparing decoded image quality to original data. Introduced an edge-sensitive metric.

Result: Different architectures and compression rates are optimal based on specific data characteristics. Edge preservation is crucial for 3D analysis.

Conclusion: The findings help scientists choose appropriate compression strategies for data storage and analysis needs.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GridTD is a novel unsupervised framework for compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, combining tensor decomposition and multi-resolution grid encoding for efficient, high-quality image recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised representations for CI reconstruction lack balance between representation ability and efficiency. GridTD addresses this gap.

Method: GridTD uses tensor decomposition and multi-resolution hash grid encoding to optimize a lightweight neural network for image reconstruction.

Result: Theoretical analyses and experiments show GridTD outperforms existing methods in tasks like video SCI and compressive MRI.

Conclusion: GridTD is a versatile, state-of-the-art CI reconstruction method with superior performance.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

TL;DR: A generative framework synthesizes breast ultrasound (BUS) images using clinical descriptions and structural masks, enhancing deep learning models for breast cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of expert-annotated BUS data limits robust deep learning model development.

Method: The framework integrates clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, controlled by morphology, echogenicity, and shape. A semantic-curvature mask generator creates diverse tumor masks.

Result: Synthetic images improve downstream diagnosis tasks and pass visual Turing tests by sonographers.

Conclusion: The framework offers clinical utility and potential for broader applications in BUS image analysis.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prognostic models for ccRCC recurrence fail due to disease complexity and reliance on single data modalities. This study aims to enhance predictive accuracy by leveraging multimodal data.

Method: The framework uses domain-specific models (CLAM for histopathology, MeD-3D for CT/MRI, MLP for clinical/genomic data) to extract features, fused via early and late integration. It also handles incomplete data.

Result: The proposed multimodal DL framework improves recurrence prediction accuracy by combining complementary data sources and addressing missing modalities.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal data with deep learning enhances ccRCC recurrence prediction, offering better clinical decision-making tools.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

### [263] [ArteryX: Advancing Brain Artery Feature Extraction with Vessel-Fused Networks and a Robust Validation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07920)
*Abrar Faiyaz,Nhat Hoang,Giovanni Schifitto,Md Nasir Uddin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ArteryX is a MATLAB-based toolbox for quantifying cerebral vascular features from 3D TOF MRA, addressing limitations of existing methods with high accuracy, efficiency, and standardized validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing cerebral vasculature lack standardized quantitative metrics and face challenges like variability and inefficiency, hindering early detection of subtle vascular changes.

Method: ArteryX uses a semi-supervised, vessel-fused network-based landmarking approach to track and manage tracings, integrating a simulation framework for validation.

Result: ArteryX showed improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and outperformed existing semi-automated methods in validation studies.

Conclusion: ArteryX offers a promising tool for clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons across patient cohorts.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
