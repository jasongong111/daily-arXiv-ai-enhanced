Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly\nimplement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:\nLloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a\ntransformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly\nimplements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard\ningredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,\nwe numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the\nexact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing\na fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or\nmultilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants\nof clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed\n$k$-means, and more.

However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the\navailability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.\nMoreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to\ndominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal\nfusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and\ngenomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,\nlimiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as\nmissing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a\nmultimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to\neffectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions\nbetween pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.\nIn addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned\npaired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete\nmodalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model\noutperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality\nscenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models\n(7.9%).

However, previous approaches\npredominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal\nand causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present\nUniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models\nvision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This\nformulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from\nlarge-scale video data.

Our approach\nsets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation\nbenchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly\nsurpassing previous methods.

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal\nEnergy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish\nas spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical\ndecay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we\npropose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log\nn)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute\ndensity, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense\nattention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial\nAttention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to\nspatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal\ndistance.
