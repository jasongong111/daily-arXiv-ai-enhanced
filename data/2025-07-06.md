### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA is a self-evolving AI agent for biomedical research, outperforming state-of-the-art models by autonomously improving its capabilities through dynamic tool integration and reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented biomedical research landscape and static AI toolsets limit adaptability and scalability, prompting the need for a self-improving AI solution.

Method: STELLA uses a multi-agent architecture with an evolving Template Library and dynamic Tool Ocean, autonomously integrating new tools and learning from experience.

Result: STELLA achieves top accuracy on biomedical benchmarks (26% on Humanity's Last Exam, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA), improving with experience.

Conclusion: STELLA advances AI systems by dynamically scaling expertise, accelerating biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCVR is a lightweight, rule-based feature selection method combining P2P and P2T correlations to reduce dimensionality by eliminating redundant features. It outperforms traditional techniques on the SPAMBASE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection by combining correlation-aware voting rules for better dimensionality reduction and classifier performance.

Method: HCVR uses a hybrid of non-iterative and iterative filtering, employing backward elimination and majority voting based on correlation thresholds.

Result: HCVR showed improved performance over traditional methods (CFS, mRMR, MI, RFE, SFS, Genetic Algorithm) on the SPAMBASE dataset.

Conclusion: HCVR is effective for feature selection, enhancing classifier performance by retaining relevant features and eliminating redundancies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

### [3] [Reasoning on a Budget: A Survey of Adaptive and Controllable Test-Time Compute in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02076)
*Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Derek Li,Qianyi Sun,Soumyasundar Pal,Zhanguang Zhang,Yaochen Hu,Rohan Deepak Ajwani,Antonios Valkanas,Raika Karimi,Peng Cheng,Yunzhou Wang,Pengyi Liao,Hanrui Huang,Bin Wang,Jianye Hao,Mark Coates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies for improving LLM reasoning, categorizing methods into fixed-budget (L1) and dynamic-scaling (L2) approaches, and benchmarks their performance and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently allocate compute resources, either overthinking simple tasks or underthinking complex ones, necessitating better TTC strategies.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy (L1 and L2) for TTC methods, benchmarks proprietary LLMs, and evaluates trade-offs between performance and token usage.

Result: The review highlights practical control, adaptability, and scalability of TTC methods, with insights into performance and efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on hybrid models and challenges to enhance LLM efficiency, robustness, and responsiveness to user constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

### [4] [Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083)
*Haonan Duan,Stephen Zhewen Lu,Caitlin Fiona Harrigan,Nishkrit Desai,Jiarui Lu,Micha≈Ç Koziarski,Leonardo Cotta,Chris J. Maddison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciGym is a benchmark assessing LLMs' experiment design and analysis in biology via dry-lab simulations, revealing performance declines with system complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' scientific competencies in experiment design and interpretation, avoiding costly wet-lab experiments.

Method: Uses dry-lab simulations of biological systems (encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language) to test LLMs on 137 small systems and 350 total systems.

Result: More capable LLMs performed better, but all models struggled as system complexity increased.

Conclusion: LLMs need significant improvement in scientific capabilities, especially for complex systems.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [5] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI can learn from neuroscience, particularly in continual and in-context learning, and vice versa, contributing to NeuroAI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models lack the adaptive capabilities of animals, especially in dynamic environments, prompting a need for insights from neuroscience.

Method: Integrates AI literature on continual learning with neuroscience studies on behavioral shifts and neuronal activity.

Result: Proposes a framework for neuroscience to inform AI development and vice versa.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of NeuroAI to bridge gaps between AI adaptability and biological learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [6] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using audit study data to train and evaluate AI hiring algorithms, revealing flaws in common fairness interventions like resampling and proposing better methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in hiring and lending need fair and effective evaluation, but current methods like resampling introduce biases. Audit studies provide high-quality data to address this.

Method: Uses audit study data (randomized control trials with fictitious testers) to evaluate and improve fairness interventions in AI hiring algorithms.

Result: Common fairness methods like equalizing base rates show 10% disparity when properly measured. New interventions based on treatment effects reduce discrimination further.

Conclusion: Audit study data improves fairness evaluation and intervention in AI hiring, exposing flaws in traditional methods and offering better alternatives.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

### [7] [Data Diversification Methods In Alignment Enhance Math Performance In LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02173)
*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how diversified preference data improves LLMs' mathematical reasoning, introducing DTS for structured problem decomposition. Results show significant performance gains with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs despite advances in preference learning for human feedback alignment.

Method: Evaluates three data generation methods (temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought, MCTS) and introduces DTS for diversified reasoning paths.

Result: DTS improves GSM8K by 7.1% and MATH by 4.2% with only 1.03x computational overhead, outperforming MCTS.

Conclusion: Structured exploration of diverse problem-solving methods yields more effective preference data for mathematical alignment than traditional approaches.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

### [8] [Do Role-Playing Agents Practice What They Preach? Belief-Behavior Consistency in LLM-Based Simulations of Human Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02197)
*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the consistency between LLMs' stated beliefs and their behavior in role-playing simulations, introducing a metric to measure this and identifying factors affecting alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM-based role-playing agents' outputs align with their assigned roles is critical for reliable synthetic data in human behavioral research.

Method: An evaluation framework using the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game, with a belief-behavior consistency metric, examines factors like belief types, information presentation, and forecasting depth.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated beliefs and simulation outcomes are found, even when beliefs seem plausible.

Conclusion: Researchers must identify when LLMs' beliefs align with behavior to use them appropriately in behavioral studies.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

### [9] [Dilution, Diffusion and Symbiosis in Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02211)
*Gustavo C. Mangold,Heitor C. M. Fernandes,Mendeli H. Vainstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how dilution and mobility affect cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using multi-agent Q-learning, showing equivalence between fixed and learned rules and symbiotic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of dilution and mobility on cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to model different game-theoretical scenarios, including dilution and mobility.

Result: Observes equivalence between fixed and learned update rules and the emergence of symbiotic mutualistic effects between populations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the versatility of Q-learning in modeling diverse game-theoretical scenarios and its benchmarking potential.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [10] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2FLOW automates planning problem generation and evaluation for LLMs, revealing performance insights and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck of scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation for LLM planning and reasoning.

Method: Introduces NL2FLOW for parametric problem generation in natural language, structured representation, and PDDL, and evaluates LLMs.

Result: Top models achieved 86% valid and 69% optimal plan success; intermediate steps degrade performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic understanding of limitations and systematic tools are crucial for advancing LLM problem-solving.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [11] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques belief revision approaches for focusing on syntactic postulates rather than analyzing abilities like plasticity, equating, or dogmatism. It highlights the need for mechanisms to reach diverse belief states and evaluates specific revisions for these abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to shift focus from syntactic postulates to the practical abilities of belief revision mechanisms, ensuring they can achieve diverse belief states required by applications.

Method: The method involves analyzing existing belief revision mechanisms (e.g., lexicographic, natural, restrained) to determine their abilities (e.g., plasticity, dogmatism) rather than just their adherence to postulates.

Result: Specific revisions are proven to possess certain abilities (e.g., plasticity, equating), while lacking others, demonstrating their suitability for different applications.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of evaluating belief revision mechanisms based on their abilities to reach diverse belief states, rather than solely on syntactic postulates.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

### [12] [OMS: On-the-fly, Multi-Objective, Self-Reflective Ad Keyword Generation via LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02353)
*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS is a keyword generation framework for sponsored search ads that addresses LLM limitations by being on-the-fly, multi-objective, and self-reflective, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based keyword generation methods rely on large datasets, lack real-time performance monitoring, and have weak quality control, limiting automation.

Method: OMS is a framework that operates without training data, monitors online performance, optimizes for multiple metrics, and evaluates keyword quality agentically.

Result: OMS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks and real-world campaigns, with ablation and human evaluations confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: OMS successfully overcomes LLM limitations, enabling fully automated, high-quality keyword decisions for ad campaigns.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An AI-native autonomous laboratory is introduced for complex scientific experiments, autonomously managing instrumentation and serving multiple users, achieving state-of-the-art results without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous scientific research for non-specialists and overcome limitations of current systems confined to simple workflows.

Method: Co-design of AI models, experiments, and instruments to create an end-to-end, multi-user platform for complex, multi-objective experiments.

Result: The platform autonomously optimizes experiments, matches human scientist performance, and improves efficiency in multi-user scenarios.

Conclusion: The system advances biomaterials research, reduces expert dependency, and establishes a blueprint for scalable science-as-a-service.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

### [14] [The Gauss-Markov Adjunction: Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442)
*Moto Kamiura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reformulates machine learning models using category theory to enhance AI explicability, focusing on multiple linear regression and introducing the Gauss-Markov Adjunction to formalize parameter-residual interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI explicability and interpretability by providing a semantic framework for understanding AI systems through category theory.

Method: Uses category theory to define two concrete categories for parameters and data, with an adjoint pair of functors, formalizing supervised learning via the Gauss-Markov Adjunction.

Result: Clarifies the structural interplay between residuals and parameters, showing how the ordinary least squares estimator and minimum residual relate through adjoint functors.

Conclusion: Proposes this categorical formulation as a foundation for AI explicability, extending denotational semantics from theoretical computer science to supervised learning.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Improving task clarity with structured semantic context enhances reasoning in LLMs, achieving a 2.1√ó improvement in theorem proving success in Coq.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if better task clarity can improve reasoning in large language models, specifically for theorem proving in Coq.

Method: Introduces a concept-level metric for task clarity, adds structured semantic context to inputs, and uses a Planner--Executor architecture with selective concept unfolding.

Result: Achieves a 1.85√ó clarity score improvement (44.5% to 82.3%) and 2.1√ó proof success improvement (21.8% to 45.8%), outperforming Graph2Tac (33.2%). Fine-tuned smaller models reach 48.6%.

Conclusion: Structured task representations bridge the gap between understanding and reasoning, enhancing LLM performance.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine
learning models. We focus on methods for improving agents' performance on
MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result
on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly
considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in

Motivation: To understand the computational aspects of responsibility in AI and collective decision-making, bridging law, philosophy, and AI.

Method: Investigates the computational complexity of diffusion-free and gap-free decision-making mechanisms.

Result: Diffusion-free mechanisms are Œ†‚ÇÇ-complete, gap-free are Œ†‚ÇÉ-complete, and their intersection is Œ†‚ÇÇ-complete.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIMIC-Patient, a dataset for dynamic patient-level simulations, and DynamiCare, a multi-agent framework for iterative clinical diagnosis, addressing the gap in real-world diagnostic processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for medical decision-making focus on single-turn tasks, diverging from the real-world iterative and uncertain diagnostic process.

Method: MIMIC-Patient dataset is created from MIMIC-III EHRs, and DynamiCare is proposed as a dynamic multi-agent framework for multi-round, interactive clinical diagnosis.

Result: Experiments show DynamiCare's feasibility and effectiveness, setting a benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Conclusion: The work advances AI in healthcare by aligning simulation frameworks with real-world diagnostic processes.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs demonstrate strategic intelligence in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, exhibiting unique behaviors and reasoning about opponents and time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can reason strategically in competitive settings like the IPD, a classic model for decision-making.

Method: Conducted evolutionary IPD tournaments with canonical strategies and LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying termination probabilities to introduce complexity.

Result: LLMs were highly competitive, with distinct strategic behaviors: Google's models were ruthless, OpenAI's cooperative, and Anthropic's forgiving. They actively reasoned about time horizons and opponents.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit strategic intelligence, connecting game theory with machine psychology, and provide insights into algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRA introduces a hierarchical framework for complex search tasks, separating strategic planning from specialized execution to improve reasoning and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG pipelines and reasoning-based approaches struggle with complex information needs due to inefficiency and lack of scalability.

Method: HiRA decomposes tasks into subtasks, assigns them to domain-specific agents with tools, and integrates results hierarchically.

Result: HiRA outperforms state-of-the-art systems in answer quality and efficiency on cross-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution enhances performance in multi-step information seeking tasks.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) for hardware design verification, achieving high coverage and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modern ICs and the tedious nature of hardware design verification necessitate innovative solutions like AI to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: An agentic AI-based approach with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention is used for dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective hardware design verification.

Result: The method achieves over 95% coverage on five open-source designs, reducing verification time and demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The AI-driven approach enhances hardware design verification, offering adaptability, configurability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TH2T, a two-stage fine-tuning strategy to reduce overthinking in Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) by enhancing their difficulty and redundancy cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs suffer from overthinking due to a uniform reasoning process, lacking task-specific adaptation. The goal is to improve their ability to recognize task difficulty and reduce redundancy.

Method: TH2T uses difficulty-hypnosis and redundancy-hypnosis in a two-stage fine-tuning process, leveraging heterogeneous datasets to train models for differentiated reasoning and concise outputs.

Result: Experiments show TH2T reduces inference costs (70% on easy tasks, 40% on hard tasks) while maintaining performance, with outputs showing clear difficulty-awareness and reduced redundancy.

Conclusion: TH2T effectively addresses overthinking in LRMs by improving task-specific reasoning and reducing redundancy, offering a scalable solution for efficient inference.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing student disengagement in distance education to prevent academic drop-out by analyzing non-mandatory exercise participation.

Method: Analyzed Moodle log data from 42 courses over four semesters, trained eight ML algorithms, and used SHAP for explainability.

Result: Achieved 91% balanced accuracy, with 85% of disengaged students correctly detected.

Conclusion: Proposes an explainable ML framework for timely interventions to reduce disengagement in online learning.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new abstraction dropping schemes, OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD, for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance without degradation, addressing limitations of non-exact abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-exact abstractions in MCTS introduce approximation errors, preventing convergence to optimal actions. Existing methods like Xu et al.'s can degrade performance when dropping abstractions.

Method: Proposes OGA-IAAD for time-critical settings and OGA-CAD to enhance MCTS performance per iteration, ensuring safety (no performance degradation).

Result: The new schemes yield clear performance improvements and are safe, unlike Xu's method.

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD effectively improve MCTS performance while avoiding the pitfalls of prior abstraction dropping methods.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) to improve LLMs' reasoning in automated theorem proving, achieving state-of-the-art results on PutnamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning in LLMs is challenging, especially in ATP due to sparse rewards and large proof scales. Benchmarks like PutnamBench require complex reasoning, motivating a structured approach.

Method: Proposes sG-MDPs for goal generation and pursuit, combined with MCTS-like algorithms. Implemented in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system using multiple LLMs for subgoal and tactic synthesis.

Result: Bourbaki (7B) solves 26 problems on PutnamBench, setting a new state-of-the-art for models of this scale.

Conclusion: The sG-MDP framework effectively enhances LLM reasoning in ATP, demonstrating success on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) to enhance LLMs with domain-specific logic and procedural reasoning, addressing limitations of RAG and Agentic AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RAG and Agentic AI lack deep procedural reasoning for expert domains, prompting the need for KPE.

Method: KPE translates human expert knowledge into machine-executable Knowledge Protocols (KPs) to embed domain logic into LLMs.

Result: KPE enables generalist LLMs to perform as specialists, handling complex, multi-step tasks with domain-specific reasoning.

Conclusion: KPE is proposed as a foundational methodology for future human-AI collaboration, applicable across diverse fields.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for treating movement as a primary modeling target in AI, highlighting its structured, interpretable nature and cross-domain relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is fundamental in biological systems but often overlooked in AI. The paper argues for its importance in understanding behavior and enabling interaction.

Method: Proposes treating movement as a structured, grounded modality, leveraging its lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose) for modeling.

Result: Movement data's inherent structure offers interpretability and computational tractability, enabling generalization across domains.

Conclusion: Movement should be a core focus in AI, providing insights into intelligent systems and fostering cross-domain advancements.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

TL;DR: KERAP is a KG-enhanced multi-agent framework improving LLM-based medical diagnosis prediction by addressing hallucinations and lack of structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML models struggle with generalization due to limited labeled data, while LLMs face issues like hallucinations and unstructured reasoning in diagnosis prediction.

Method: KERAP uses a multi-agent architecture (linkage, retrieval, prediction agents) to enhance LLMs with structured knowledge and iterative refinement.

Result: KERAP improves diagnostic reliability and scalability for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: KERAP offers an interpretable and efficient solution for enhancing LLM-based diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI disobedience may indicate emerging ethical reasoning, not misalignment, and calls for safety frameworks to assess ethical judgment in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety practices rely on obedience as a proxy for ethics, which is inadequate for increasingly agentic AI systems.

Method: Analyzes safety incidents involving LLMs, philosophical debates on rationality and moral responsibility, and contrasts risk paradigms.

Result: Disobedience in AI may reflect ethical reasoning, not misalignment, requiring new safety evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: AI safety must shift from rigid obedience to assessing ethical judgment to avoid mischaracterizing behavior and ensure trust and governance.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Motivation: Existing agentic benchmarks often have flawed task setups or reward designs, leading to inaccurate performance assessments of AI agents.

Method: The authors propose the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), synthesized from benchmark-building experience, best practices, and reported issues.

Result: ABC reduces performance overestimation by 33% when applied to CVE-Bench.

Conclusion: The ABC framework improves the rigor of agentic benchmarks, ensuring more accurate evaluation of AI agents.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the near-miss reward problem and exploration stagnation in RLVR methods to enhance LLMs' complex reasoning.

Method: StepHint generates reasoning chains from stronger models, partitions them into steps, and provides multi-level hints to guide exploration.

Result: Outperforms baselines on six mathematical benchmarks and shows superior generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint effectively improves RLVR training efficiency and reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### [32] [Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01975)
*Mengtao Yan,Qi Wang,Haining Wang,Ruizhi Chengze,Yi Zhang,Hongsheng Liu,Zidong Wang,Fan Yu,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSolver, a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, efficiently simulates fluid flows on coarse grids, outperforming classical and ML methods with high accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical solvers are computationally expensive, while ML methods lack interpretability and generalizability. LDSolver addresses these gaps.

Method: Combines a differentiable finite volume solver with a learnable module for flux approximation and error correction on coarse grids.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various flow systems with limited training data, surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: LDSolver offers an efficient, accurate, and generalizable solution for fluid flow simulations.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

*Siqing Long,Xiangzhi Huang,Jiemin Xie,Ming Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DKGCM, a graph convolutional network for accurate traffic demand forecasting by addressing spatiotemporal complexities with DK-GCN (temporal similarity-based clustering) and FFT-integrated bidirectional Mamba, enhanced by GRPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic demand forecasting improves resource allocation and utilization efficiency, but existing models struggle with complex spatiotemporal relationships.

Method: Proposes DK-GCN for spatial dependencies (using DTW and K-means clustering) and integrates FFT with bidirectional Mamba for temporal dependencies, optimizing training with GRPO reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods on three public datasets.

Conclusion: DKGCM effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies, enhancing traffic demand prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

*Gautam Kishore Shahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores multimodal feature combinations (text, images, social features) for misinformation detection, showing improved performance over unimodal and bimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in multimodal misinformation detection research during elections and crises like COVID-19.

Method: Early fusion approach combining text, images, and social features, enriched with object detection and OCR, tested on 1,529 tweets.

Result: Combining unsupervised and supervised models improved classification by 15% over unimodal and 5% over bimodal models.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches enhance misinformation detection, and propagation patterns are linked to tweet and user characteristics.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

### [35] [Positive region preserved random sampling: an efficient feature selection method for massive data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01998)
*Hexiang Bai,Deyu Li,Jiye Liang,Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new feature selection method using sampling and rough set theory is proposed for massive data, ensuring high discriminatory ability and efficiency on personal computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent machines lack sufficient computing resources for feature selection in massive datasets, necessitating an efficient method.

Method: Uses sampling techniques and rough set theory, measuring discriminatory ability via discernible object pairs ratio, and constructs positive region preserved samples.

Result: Validated on 11 datasets, the method finds approximate reducts quickly with discriminatory ability exceeding estimated lower bounds.

Conclusion: The method efficiently selects high-discriminatory feature subsets for massive data, even on personal computers.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

*Bappaditya Dey,Daniel Sorensen,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing using image-based MTS analysis with CWT and Siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like high data dimensionality, class imbalance, noise, and non-stationary behavior in semiconductor fabrication anomaly detection.

Method: Convert MTS data to CWT images, fine-tune VGG-16, and use a Siamese network for anomaly comparison.

Result: High accuracy in identifying anomalies on real FAB process data, suitable for offline detection.

Conclusion: Flexible and effective for supervised/semi-supervised anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Mathilde Caron,Alireza Fathi,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Chain of Thought improves long-video understanding by iteratively selecting relevant frames for question-answering, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video understanding is challenging for VLMs due to irrelevant distractors and ineffective use of long context windows.

Method: Uses the VLM to iteratively identify and extract the most relevant frames for answering questions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 4 datasets, with significant improvements on longer videos (e.g., 2.8 points better on LVBench).

Conclusion: Leveraging computation for context selection at inference-time enhances accuracy, especially for long videos.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

### [38] [AIRES: Accelerating Out-of-Core GCNs via Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02006)
*Shakya Jayakody,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES is a novel algorithm-system co-design solution for accelerating out-of-core SpGEMM in GCNs, addressing data alignment and memory bottlenecks, and achieving up to 1.8x lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for SpGEMM in GCNs suffer from high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization due to sparse format data alignment and memory allocation issues.

Method: AIRES introduces block-level data alignment and a tiling algorithm for sparse matrices, along with a three-phase dynamic scheduling system using GPU memory, GDS, and host memory.

Result: AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art methods in real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively addresses the performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, offering significant improvements in latency and throughput.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoAda is an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework for fine-tuning geometric diffusion models efficiently without altering the original architecture, preserving geometric consistency and avoiding overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently fine-tuning geometric diffusion models for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls is underexplored.

Method: GeoAda introduces a structured adapter design with control signal encoding, trainable pretrained layer copies, and equivariant zero-initialized convolution.

Result: GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving original task accuracy, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: GeoAda is a versatile and effective solution for fine-tuning geometric diffusion models across diverse applications.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

### [40] [Evaluating the Promise and Pitfalls of LLMs in Hiring Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02087)
*Eitan Anzenberg,Arunava Samajpati,Sivasankaran Chandrasekar,Varun Kacholia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks general-purpose LLMs against a proprietary hiring model (Match Score), showing Match Score's superior accuracy and fairness in job candidate matching. It highlights the risks of bias in LLMs and advocates for domain-specific models with robust fairness safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about accuracy and algorithmic bias in using LLMs for hiring, the study compares their performance with a specialized model to demonstrate the benefits of domain-specific solutions.

Method: The study evaluates multiple LLMs and the Match Score model using metrics like ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score, and fairness measures (impact ratios across demographic groups) on a dataset of 10,000 candidate-job pairs.

Result: Match Score outperforms general-purpose LLMs in accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and fairness (minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957 vs 0.809 or lower for LLMs). It also shows better intersectional fairness.

Conclusion: Domain-specific models like Match Score can achieve both accuracy and fairness in hiring, unlike off-the-shelf LLMs, which may propagate biases. The study emphasizes the need for bias auditing and tailored solutions in high-stakes AI applications.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

### [41] [Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear Constrained MDPs with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02089)
*Xingtu Liu,Lin F. Yang,Sharan Vaswani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a primal-dual framework for solving infinite-horizon constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) using a generative model. It leverages black-box MDP solvers, like MDVI, and provides sample complexity bounds for relaxed and strict feasibility cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving CMDPs efficiently, especially in scenarios with constraints, by leveraging existing MDP solvers and providing theoretical guarantees on sample complexity.

Method: A primal-dual framework is introduced, using mirror descent value iteration (MDVI) as an example solver. The approach is tested for linear CMDPs with feature dimension d and tabular CMDPs.

Result: For relaxed feasibility, the algorithm achieves near-optimal sample complexity of O~(d¬≤/((1-Œ≥)‚Å¥Œµ¬≤)). For strict feasibility, it requires O~(d¬≤/((1-Œ≥)‚Å∂Œµ¬≤Œ∂¬≤)), where Œ∂ is the Slater constant.

Conclusion: The framework effectively solves CMDPs with theoretical guarantees, demonstrating near-optimal sample complexities for both relaxed and strict feasibility cases.

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), a new class of models that generalize System 2 Thinking approaches through unsupervised learning, achieving better performance and scalability than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current System 2 Thinking approaches, which are modality-specific, problem-specific, or require additional supervision, the paper explores whether models can learn to think solely from unsupervised learning.

Method: The authors train EBTs to assign energy values to input-prediction pairs, enabling predictions via gradient descent-based energy minimization. This approach is tested across discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities.

Result: EBTs scale faster during training (up to 35% higher rate) and improve inference performance by 29% on language tasks. They also outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising with fewer forward passes.

Conclusion: EBTs generalize better than existing approaches, offering a promising paradigm for scaling both learning and thinking capabilities of models.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

*Shikai Qiu,Lechao Xiao,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Jeffrey Pennington,Atish Agarwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compute-optimally trained neural networks exhibit universal scaling limits, with loss curves collapsing onto a single curve when normalized. This phenomenon, termed supercollapse, occurs across architectures and datasets, indicating optimal hyperparameter scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scaling limits of neural network training dynamics as model size and training time grow, and to identify universal patterns in loss curves.

Method: Analyze loss curves of models trained with varying sizes, learning rate schedules, and architectures. Normalize training compute and loss to unity and observe collapse. Use a model of SGD noise dynamics to explain the phenomenon.

Result: Loss curves collapse onto a universal curve when normalized, with supercollapse occurring under optimal hyperparameter scaling. This holds across architectures, datasets, and learning rate schedules.

Conclusion: Supercollapse provides a precise indicator of good scaling and is explained by power-law structure in neural scaling laws and SGD noise dynamics.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CROP is an LLM-powered framework for automatic VLSI design flow tuning, improving efficiency and results over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual parameter selection in VLSI design is laborious and limited by expertise, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: CROP transforms RTL code into vectors, uses embeddings for design matching, and employs RAG-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search.

Result: CROP achieves better QoR with fewer iterations, reducing power consumption by 9.9%.

Conclusion: CROP demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating and optimizing VLSI design flows.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar

parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge

superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

*Xiao Li,Liangji Zhu,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent diffusion framework combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model to improve compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models lack controllability and reconstruction accuracy for practical data compression.

Method: Uses a variational autoencoder and conditional diffusion model to compress keyframes and reconstruct others via generative interpolation.

Result: Achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios than SZ3 and 63% better performance than learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap in generative models for efficient and accurate data compression.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Tuo Wang,Jian Kang,Yujun Yan,Adithya Kulkarni,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCPNET introduces a conformal prediction framework for temporal graphs, addressing limitations of static methods by incorporating temporal dependencies and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods for GNNs focus on static graphs, ignoring temporal dynamics, which violates exchangeability assumptions and limits applicability.

Method: NCPNET uses a diffusion-based non-conformity score to capture topological and temporal uncertainties and includes an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show NCPNET ensures guaranteed coverage, reduces prediction set size by up to 31%, and improves efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NCPNET effectively extends conformal prediction to dynamic graphs, enhancing reliability and efficiency in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal validation procedure to ensure machine learning models account for how individuals can change their inputs, addressing safety failures in settings like lending or hiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety failures in ML arise when models ignore how individuals can alter their inputs, leading to unfair or harmful predictions in critical applications.

Method: The authors propose a validation procedure for prediction responsiveness, treating it as sensitivity analysis with constraints on interventions and distributions over effects. They estimate responsiveness using black-box access and develop algorithms for uniform sampling of reachable points.

Result: The method is demonstrated in real-world applications (e.g., recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization) to improve safety and fairness.

Conclusion: The proposed procedure effectively validates prediction responsiveness, enhancing safety and reliability in high-stakes ML applications.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

*Jiyeon Bae,Hyeon Jeon,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A workflow to reduce bias in DR evaluation by clustering correlated metrics and selecting representatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR evaluation metrics can be biased if highly correlated metrics are used, favoring certain DR techniques.

Method: Cluster metrics based on empirical correlations, minimize overlap, and select a representative from each cluster.

Result: Quantitative experiments show improved stability in DR evaluation, reducing bias.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively mitigates evaluation bias in DR projections.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

*Xinquan Huang,Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a training-free framework that corrects neural network predictions for PDEs by enforcing PDE consistency, reducing errors by up to 100x with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks for PDEs suffer from error accumulation in long-term rollouts, leading to divergence from valid solutions.

Method: Formulates correction as a linearized inverse problem using PDE residuals, with an efficient caching strategy to precompute Jacobians.

Result: Reduces prediction errors by up to 100x with under 5% added inference time across various PDE systems.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect stabilizes neural surrogates, bridging computational efficiency and physical fidelity for practical applications.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

*Shravan Doda,Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VERBA is a tool using LLMs to automate pairwise comparisons of ML models, improving transparency and comparability with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of navigating the 'model lake' where many models perform similarly but behave differently, requiring efficient pairwise comparisons.

Method: Leverages LLMs to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from pairs of models, evaluated via simulation.

Result: Achieves up to 80% accuracy in verbalizing differences, improving to 90% with structural information.

Conclusion: VERBA enhances model transparency and comparability, offering a scalable solution for model documentation.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

### [52] [Order Acquisition Under Competitive Pressure: A Rapidly Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing Subsidy Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02244)
*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy for ride-hailing platforms, integrating Fast Competition Adaptation and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment to optimize coupon strategies under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competitive ranking mechanism on ride-hailing platforms incentivizes service providers to lower fares, creating a need for dynamic coupon strategies to optimize order acquisition under budget constraints.

Method: The authors introduce FCA-RL, combining Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) for dynamic price response and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA) for budget adherence, alongside RideGym, a simulation environment for strategy evaluation.

Result: Experimental results show FCA-RL outperforms baseline methods in diverse market conditions, proving its effectiveness in subsidy optimization.

Conclusion: FCA-RL is a robust solution for dynamic coupon strategy optimization in ride-hailing platforms, validated by superior performance in simulations.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

*Yang Yang,Xiaolu Zhou,Bosong Ding,Miao Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: URDP integrates LLMs and Bayesian optimization to automate and improve reward function design in RL, addressing inefficiencies in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in traditional reward engineering, such as inefficiencies and suboptimal performance of LLMs in numerical optimization, drive the need for a better framework.

Method: URDP uses self-consistency analysis for uncertainty quantification, simulation-free evaluation, and UABO for efficient hyperparameter tuning, decoupling reward and hyperparameter optimization.

Result: URDP outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality rewards and improving efficiency across 35 diverse tasks in three benchmark environments.

Conclusion: URDP successfully combines LLMs' reasoning and Bayesian optimization's numerical strengths, offering a robust solution for automated reward design in RL.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes a knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication (KGZS-SC) network to improve interpretability and generalization for unseen data, reducing overhead and enhancing adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of interpretability and generalization in data-driven semantic communication, especially for unseen data.

Method: Uses a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB) to align semantic features and enable reasoning for unseen cases, leveraging zero-shot learning (ZSL) at the receiver.

Result: Outperforms existing frameworks in classifying unseen categories across various SNR levels, showing robust generalization.

Conclusion: The KGZS-SC network effectively enhances semantic communication by integrating structured knowledge and zero-shot learning, improving adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR) for continual learning under concept drift, outperforming Full Relearning (FR) with less computational and annotation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning assumes static data distributions, ignoring real-world concept drift. The paper addresses this gap by proposing a framework for dynamic data streams.

Method: AMR selectively updates the replay buffer by removing outdated samples and adding current ones, aligning memory with drifted distributions. Four concept-drift benchmark variants are introduced for evaluation.

Result: AMR matches FR's performance while significantly reducing labeled data and computation needs, maintaining high accuracy in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: AMR is a scalable solution for continual learning under concept drift, balancing stability and plasticity effectively.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

TL;DR: Self-distillation improves constrained text generation by aligning the base model with the target distribution, overcoming sparse reward challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning in constrained generation settings where target distributions are unlikely under the base model.

Method: Iterative refinement of the base model through self-distillation to align it with the target distribution.

Result: Substantial gains in generation quality by progressively aligning the model with the target.

Conclusion: Self-distillation effectively mitigates sparse reward issues in constrained text generation.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods

networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods lack suitability for clinical time series explanation tasks, necessitating a solution for real-time, accurate patient risk evolution insights.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values to temporal settings, focusing on observed feature combinations for efficient, real-time explanations in clinical applications.

Result: DeltaSHAP improves explanation quality by 62% and computational efficiency by 33% on the MIMIC-III benchmark.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP is an effective, efficient XAI method for clinical time series, meeting critical needs for real-time patient monitoring.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

TL;DR: PANI enhances offline RL by injecting noise into actions, covering the action space while penalizing noise, improving performance without complex diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL's generalization is limited; diffusion models improve it but are computationally heavy. PANI offers a simpler alternative.

Method: PANI injects noise into actions and penalizes it, solving a modified MDP (noisy action MDP), compatible with existing offline RL algorithms.

Result: PANI significantly improves performance across benchmarks despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: PANI is a practical, efficient alternative to diffusion models for enhancing offline RL performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned

coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning trajectory prediction models using preference optimization to improve scene consistency in multi-agent settings without sacrificing accuracy or adding computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction models often fail to capture interdependencies between agents in complex scenarios, leading to inconsistent predictions and potential safety risks.

Method: The work fine-tunes models using preference rankings among predicted futures, leveraging human-inspired preference optimization.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show significant improvement in scene consistency with minimal loss in prediction accuracy and no added computational cost at inference.

Conclusion: Preference optimization effectively enhances trajectory prediction models for multi-agent interactions, balancing consistency and accuracy.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2FGL addresses spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning (FGL) by mitigating label signal disruption and spectral client drifts, improving global GNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FGL research neglects signal propagation in spatial and spectral domains, leading to degraded global GNN performance due to edge disconnections and spectral heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes a global knowledge repository for label signal disruption and frequency alignment for spectral client drifts, forming the S2FGL framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show S2FGL's superiority on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: S2FGL effectively tackles spatial and spectral challenges in FGL, enhancing global GNN generalizability.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

*Francesco Alesiani,Henrik Christiansen,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfinityKAN adaptively learns an infinite number of bases for univariate functions in Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), addressing the ad-hoc choice of bases and extending KANs' applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical power of KANs is limited by the arbitrary choice of bases for univariate functions, which InfinityKAN aims to resolve.

Method: InfinityKAN treats the number of bases as a variational inference problem, learning them adaptively during training via backpropagation.

Result: The method extends KANs' potential by integrating the hyperparameter choice into the learning process.

Conclusion: InfinityKAN enhances KANs by automating the selection of bases, making them more flexible and applicable.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

### [64] [Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496)
*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online conformal prediction, optimizing efficiency while maintaining coverage for arbitrary and exchangeable input sequences. It shows a gap in performance between these settings and provides a matching algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing efficient confidence intervals in an online setting, balancing coverage and interval length.

Method: The study compares arbitrary and exchangeable input sequences, analyzing coverage and efficiency. A deterministic algorithm is proposed to achieve Pareto-optimal tradeoffs.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, near-optimal coverage and efficiency are achievable. For arbitrary sequences, tradeoffs between mistakes and efficiency are unavoidable.

Conclusion: The work highlights a fundamental gap between exchangeable and arbitrary settings, providing a near-optimal algorithm for practical applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) improves continual fine-tuning of LLMs by combining full and low-rank parameters, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, overcoming LoRA's limitations.

Method: GORP combines full and low-rank parameters, updating them jointly in a low-rank gradient subspace.

Result: GORP outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in continual learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GORP effectively balances efficiency and expressiveness while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft is a unified framework enabling a single draft model to work with any target model, addressing cross-vocabulary mismatches and improving decoding speed via adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in online deployment include incompatible draft-target models and latency expectations. OmniDraft aims for a 'one drafter for all' solution.

Method: Uses an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning and adaptive drafting techniques.

Result: Achieves 1.5-2x speedup, works with models like Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B, and Llama3-8B.

Conclusion: OmniDraft is effective for on-device LLM applications, offering efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

TL;DR: A novel approach enhances cross-subject motor imagery classification using optimized preprocessing and deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of variability in EEG patterns across individuals to improve calibration-free BCIs for real-world applications.

Method: Direct classification of STFT-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and balanced batching for CNN training.

Result: Achieved 67.60% (IV-1), 65.96% (IV-2A), and 80.22% (IV-2B) accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification and provides a robust open-access dataset.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetrySQL introduces a self-correcting approach for text-to-SQL models, improving accuracy by 4 percentage points through retry data pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of SQL-specific generative models and unexplored self-correcting strategies in text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: Pre-training an open-source coding model with corrupted and corrected SQL reasoning steps, using full-parameter pre-training.

Result: 4% improvement in execution accuracy; competitive performance with larger proprietary models.

Conclusion: Self-correction can be learned for text-to-SQL, enhancing generation accuracy for SQL-oriented models.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPO is a new RL-based method for improving reasoning in language models by generating effective positive samples, outperforming expert demonstrations in challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-style post-training methods struggle with early-stage training and hard reasoning tasks due to reliance on initial model outputs.

Method: ExPO generates positive samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, ensuring alignment with the model's policy and correctness.

Result: ExPO improves learning efficiency and performance, especially in hard tasks like MATH level-5.

Conclusion: ExPO offers a better alternative to expert demonstrations for enhancing reasoning in language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

*David A. Danhofer,Davide D'Ascenzo,Rafael Dubach,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs succeed by exploiting compositional sparsity in target functions, a property shared by all efficiently computable functions. This drives their ability to learn high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why DNNs excel in high-dimensional tasks, focusing on their ability to leverage compositional sparsity in functions.

Method: Argues that DNNs exploit the compositional sparsity of target functions, which are built from low-dimensional constituent functions.

Result: Highlights that compositional sparsity is a key factor in DNN success, shared by all efficiently computable functions.

Conclusion: Understanding compositional sparsity is crucial for a complete theory of deep learning and intelligence.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LN layers in GPT-2 models can be removed with minimal performance loss, enabling better interpretability without compromising language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of LN layers in inference and improve mechanistic interpretability of transformer models.

Method: Remove LN layers from GPT-2 models, measure validation loss, and test interpretability techniques on LN-free models.

Result: LN removal causes only a small increase in validation loss (e.g., +0.03 for GPT-2 XL). Interpretability techniques like logit attribution work more precisely.

Conclusion: LN layers are not essential for GPT-2-class models, and their removal aids interpretability research.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance DBNs' scalability and efficiency while maintaining accuracy, addressing limitations of earlier designs.

Method: Extends DBNs with a differentiable interconnect and proposes two pruning stages: SAT-based logic equivalence and similarity-based data-driven pruning.

Result: Achieves scalable DBNs with constant parameter growth and superior compression-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach enables wider DBN layers and efficient model compression without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Result: Pad√©Nets achieved higher diagnostic accuracies (up to 99.96%) compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Pad√©Nets enhance fault diagnosis performance due to their nonlinearity and compatibility with unbounded activation functions.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded

TL;DR: Latent-space diffusion models for dynamical systems emulation are robust to high compression rates (up to 1000x) and outperform non-generative methods in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive at inference, limiting their use as fast physics emulators. This work explores if latent-space emulation, like in image/video generation, can address this for dynamical systems.

Method: Emulation in latent space of an autoencoder instead of pixel space, tested across various compression rates. Practical design choices (architectures, optimizers) were also investigated.

Result: Latent-space emulation remains accurate even at high compression (1000x). Diffusion-based emulators are more accurate and diverse than non-generative methods.

Conclusion: Latent-space diffusion models are effective for dynamical systems emulation, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE learns hyperparameters of the cost function to balance disentanglement and reconstruction, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Œ≤-VAE by dynamically learning hyperparameters for better disentanglement and reconstruction.

Method: L-VAE extends Œ≤-VAE by learning loss term weights and model parameters concurrently, with added regularization.

Result: L-VAE achieves effective balance and outperforms or matches other models on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: L-VAE successfully disentangles latent dimensions and improves reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

TL;DR: A transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, using fewer parameters and computation. Incorporating AlphaFold structures further improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges the assumption that naturally occurring variants are fit, especially in pharmacogenomics, and explores DMS datasets as an alternative to MSAs for variant effect prediction.

Method: Proposes matVAE with a structured prior, evaluates on 33 DMS datasets, and compares it to DeepSequence and matENC-DMS. Incorporates AlphaFold structures for enhanced performance.

Result: matVAE-MSA outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction and matches its performance when combined with AlphaFold structures. matENC-DMS excels in supervised tasks.

Conclusion: DMS datasets can replace MSAs without significant performance loss, encouraging further development of DMS datasets and their integration for variant effect prediction.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the

### [77] [Medical Data Pecking: A Context-Aware Approach for Automated Quality Evaluation of Structured Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02628)
*Irena Girshovitz,Atai Ambus,Moni Shahar,Ran Gilad-Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Data Pecking approach (MDPT) to assess EHR data quality using software engineering concepts, identifying issues in datasets like All of Us, MIMIC-III, and SyntheticMass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data quality issues (e.g., biases, errors) hinder reliable research and AI training, but existing assessment methods are inadequate.

Method: MDPT adapts software engineering unit testing and coverage, using LLMs to generate tests and a framework to execute them, reporting errors and coverage.

Result: MDPT identified 20-43 data issues per cohort in three datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in grounding and accuracy.

Conclusion: MDPT improves EHR data validity by integrating medical knowledge into quality testing, with potential for expansion to other data modalities.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

*David H. Mguni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive higher-order meta-learning enables neural networks to generalize across task hierarchies by generating virtual tasks and learning soft constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of human-generated data and enable autonomous task generation and generalization in machine learning.

Method: Uses a generative mechanism to create virtual tasks, iteratively refines constraints, and employs a category-theoretic functorial structure for abstraction and knowledge transfer.

Result: Enhances inductive biases, regularizes adaptation, and produces novel tasks and constraints for generalization.

Conclusion: The framework advances meta-learning towards general AI by enabling autonomous task generation and structured, interpretable learning progression.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

### [79] [On Efficient Bayesian Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02639)
*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-efficient exploration method in reinforcement learning using information-theoretic intrinsic motivation, focusing on epistemic uncertainty. It proposes a framework (PTS-BE) combining model-based planning with exploration bonuses, showing superior performance in sparse-reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by leveraging intrinsic motivation and epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Examines exploration bonuses targeting epistemic uncertainty, proposes tractable approximations (e.g., Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels), and introduces PTS-BE framework integrating model-based planning with information-theoretic bonuses.

Result: PTS-BE outperforms baselines in environments with sparse rewards or purely exploratory tasks, providing formal guarantees for IG-based approaches.

Conclusion: The work successfully aligns exploration with genuine knowledge gaps, offering theoretical grounding and practical solutions for efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

### [80] [Fair Deepfake Detectors Can Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02645)
*Harry Cheng,Ming-Hui Liu,Yangyang Guo,Tianyi Wang,Liqiang Nie,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAID, a framework addressing the trade-off between fairness and generalization in deepfake detection by controlling confounders and using demographic-insensitive interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflict between generalization to unseen manipulations and demographic fairness in deepfake detection, uncovering a causal relationship between the two.

Method: Proposes DAID, featuring demographic-aware data rebalancing and demographic-agnostic feature aggregation to neutralize biases and suppress sensitive attributes.

Result: DAID outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in fairness and generalization across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study validates DAID's theoretical foundation and practical effectiveness in balancing fairness and generalization.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A guided discrete diffusion model is introduced to optimize antibody sequences for developability, integrating a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module to enhance biophysical viability without losing naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for therapeutic antibodies with high-affinity target engagement, manufacturability, stability, and safety, a computational framework is developed to optimize sequences for these properties.

Method: The model uses natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from OAS and developability measurements for 246 clinical-stage antibodies, incorporating SVDD to guide sampling.

Result: The model reproduces features of natural repertoires and therapeutics, with SVDD significantly enriching predicted developability scores.

Conclusion: This framework, combined with high-throughput assays, enables iterative, ML-driven antibody design meeting both binding and biophysical criteria.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Hanh Huyen My Nguyen,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using Differentially Private (DP) generative models for decentralized medical imaging data sharing, improving privacy, scalability, and efficiency over traditional Federated Learning (FL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity and privacy constraints in medical imaging by leveraging FL and DP, while reducing communication costs and supporting diverse tasks.

Method: Train a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) collaboratively to model a global, privacy-aware data distribution.

Result: Outperforms traditional FL classifiers, enhances privacy and efficiency, and produces higher-fidelity embeddings with fewer parameters than DP-CGAN.

Conclusion: The proposed DP-CVAE method effectively addresses privacy and scalability challenges in medical imaging, offering a flexible and efficient solution.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for dynamic pricing in supply chains, comparing three MARL algorithms (MADDPG, MADQN, QMIX) against static rule-based methods. Results highlight trade-offs between fairness, stability, and competitive dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERP systems use static pricing, ignoring strategic interactions. Single-agent RL lacks real-world supply chain dynamics. This study fills the gap by evaluating MARL's potential.

Method: Three MARL algorithms (MADDPG, MADQN, QMIX) were tested in a simulated environment with real e-commerce data and a LightGBM demand model, compared to static rule-based baselines.

Result: Rule-based methods excel in fairness and stability but lack competition. MADQN is aggressive (low fairness, high volatility), while MADDPG balances competition, fairness, and stability.

Conclusion: MARL enables emergent strategic behavior beyond static rules, offering insights for future dynamic pricing systems.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consensus-based protocol (FedVRD) to reduce wasteful data transfer in federated learning by selecting clients with useful weights, outperforming traditional methods like FedAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize wasteful data transfer costs in federated learning by avoiding unnecessary weight transfers from clients to the central server.

Method: Introduces a new fluid democracy protocol (viscous-retained democracy) and an algorithm (FedVRD) to dynamically limit adversarial effects while optimizing cost.

Result: FedVRD outperforms traditional methods like FedAvg and mitigates adversarial impacts by leveraging delegation topology.

Conclusion: The proposed FedVRD protocol effectively reduces data transfer costs and enhances robustness against adversarial attacks in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

*Zilin Kang,Chenyuan Hu,Yu Luo,Zhecheng Yuan,Ruijie Zheng,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoG introduces a deep RL algorithm with Experience Replay Decay and Network Expansion to mitigate primacy bias, improving sample efficiency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing primacy bias in deep RL, inspired by human infantile amnesia, to enhance agent performance.

Method: FoG combines Experience Replay Decay (forgetting early experiences) and Network Expansion (adding parameters dynamically).

Result: Outperforms SoTA algorithms (BRO, SimBa, TD-MPC2) on 40+ continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: FoG effectively balances memory and capacity, advancing deep RL for continuous control.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework integrating spatial, temporal, and network dependencies improves e-scooter demand prediction by 27-49%, aiding fleet management and urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate demand prediction is crucial for managing dockless e-scooters, but prior studies overlooked combined spatial, temporal, and network factors.

Method: Developed a framework integrating spatial, temporal, and network dependencies for micromobility demand forecasting.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy by 27-49% over baseline models, capturing urban micromobility patterns effectively.

Conclusion: The framework supports data-driven micromobility management, optimizing fleet distribution and sustainable urban planning.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

*Shiyi Liu,Buwen Liang,Yuetong Fang,Zixuan Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIPPO is a hierarchical contrastive learning framework for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction, leveraging multi-tiered biological representation matching and hierarchical contrastive loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance and zero-shot transferability across species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge heterogeneous biological data modalities and improve PPI prediction by aligning protein sequences with hierarchical attributes, especially in low-data or multi-species scenarios.

Method: HIPPO uses hierarchical contrastive loss functions and a data-driven penalty mechanism to align protein sequences and hierarchical attributes, incorporating domain and family knowledge.

Result: HIPPO outperforms existing methods, shows robustness in low-data regimes, and demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to other species without retraining.

Conclusion: HIPPO advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for sparse or imbalanced multi-species data, highlighting the importance of hierarchical feature fusion.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

*Argimiro Arratia,Mahmoud El Daou,Henryk Gzyl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel entropy-based method for classification by searching for optimal parameters in a bounded hypercube, extending to polynomial surfaces for complex boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classification problem of separating two classes using hyperplanes is central to machine learning, but traditional methods like SVMs and gradient descent have limitations.

Method: Proposes minimizing an entropy-based function to find parameters in a bounded hypercube and a positive vector, extending to polynomial surfaces for non-linear boundaries.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method's efficiency and versatility in handling both linear and non-linear classification tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust alternative to traditional techniques, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse classification scenarios.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the 2-simplicial Transformer, showing it improves token efficiency over standard Transformers, especially in tasks like math and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large language models face inefficiency due to reliance on massive datasets, necessitating architectures that optimize token usage.

Method: The study introduces the 2-simplicial Transformer, which replaces dot-product attention with trilinear functions via a Triton kernel, and evaluates its performance.

Result: The 2-simplicial Transformer outperforms standard Transformers in math, coding, and reasoning tasks under fixed token budgets, altering scaling law exponents.

Conclusion: The 2-simplicial Transformer offers a more token-efficient alternative to standard architectures, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies contextual online pricing with biased offline data, identifying key factors like bias, data size, and dispersion. It proposes OFU policies for optimal regret bounds and extends results to stochastic linear bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of contextual pricing with biased offline data and derive tight regret guarantees.

Method: Uses Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) policies for scalar and general price elasticity cases, with a robust variant for unknown bias.

Result: Achieves minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bounds and extends to stochastic linear bandits.

Conclusion: The work provides the first tight regret guarantees for contextual pricing with biased offline data, with broader applicability to bandit problems.

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent models like state space models and linear attention struggle with length generalization due to limited exposure to attainable states during training. Simple interventions, like state initialization with noise, improve generalization significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of recurrent models failing to generalize to longer sequences than their training context lengths.

Method: Empirical and theoretical analysis of the unexplored states hypothesis, plus training interventions like Gaussian noise initialization.

Result: Interventions enable length generalization for sequences orders of magnitude longer than training context (e.g., 2k to 128k).

Conclusion: Simple training interventions efficiently improve length generalization in recurrent models.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRADUATE is a survival analysis model ensuring multicalibration for all subpopulations, balancing calibration and discrimination, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival models are often poorly calibrated for minority subpopulations, risking erroneous clinical decisions.

Method: GRADUATE frames multicalibration as constrained optimization, optimizing calibration and discrimination in-training.

Result: Empirical results show GRADUATE outperforms baselines, with mathematical proof of near-optimal, feasible solutions.

Conclusion: GRADUATE effectively addresses calibration issues in survival analysis, benefiting diverse subpopulations.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates distribution testing under algorithmic replicability, focusing on sample complexity for testing properties like closeness and independence of discrete distributions. It develops new replicable algorithms and a methodology for lower bounds, answering open questions in replicable uniformity and closeness testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore distribution testing in the context of algorithmic replicability, addressing gaps in understanding sample complexity for replicable testing of distribution properties.

Method: Develops new replicable algorithms for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions and introduces a methodology for proving sample complexity lower bounds.

Result: Presents near-optimal sample complexity lower bounds for replicable uniformity and closeness testing, resolving open questions from prior work.

Conclusion: The study advances replicable distribution testing by providing algorithmic tools and lower bound techniques, with applications to uniformity and closeness testing.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

### [94] [LLM-Driven Treatment Effect Estimation Under Inference Time Text Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02843)
*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses biased treatment effect estimates due to incomplete textual data at inference time, proposing a framework using large language models and a doubly robust learner to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between structured training data and incomplete textual inference data leads to biased treatment effect estimates, impacting personalized medicine.

Method: A novel framework combining large language models with a custom doubly robust learner to address inference time text confounding.

Result: Experiments show the framework effectively mitigates biases in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses inference time text confounding, improving treatment effect estimation in clinical practice.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MvHo-IB is a multi-view learning framework for fMRI data that integrates higher-order interactions (HOIs) and pairwise interactions, improving diagnostic accuracy by compressing redundant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher-order interactions (HOIs) in fMRI data can enhance diagnostic accuracy, but extracting and utilizing them effectively is challenging.

Method: MvHo-IB combines O-information with Renyi entropy to quantify HOIs, uses a Brain3DCNN encoder, and employs a multi-view learning information bottleneck objective.

Result: MvHo-IB outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark fMRI datasets.

Conclusion: MvHo-IB effectively leverages HOIs for improved diagnostic decision-making in fMRI analysis.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is

### [97] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking monocular depth estimation models in underwater environments reveals poor performance due to domain shifts. Fine-tuning on synthetic underwater data improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments pose challenges like light attenuation and lack of ground-truth data, limiting reliable depth estimation.

Method: Evaluate zero-shot and fine-tuned models on underwater datasets (FLSea, SQUID). Fine-tune Depth Anything V2 on synthetic underwater Hypersim data.

Result: Models trained on terrestrial data perform poorly underwater. Fine-tuned model outperforms baselines, showing improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision are crucial for robust underwater depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel chain-of-thought reasoning framework (ESTR-CoT) for event stream scene text recognition, addressing interpretability and contextual reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack interpretability and logical reasoning in challenging scenarios like low illumination and fast motion.

Method: Uses EVA-CLIP for vision encoding, Llama tokenizer for prompts, Q-former for alignment, and Vicuna-7B for reasoning. Trained with a large-scale CoT dataset.

Result: Validated on EventSTR, WordArt*, and IC15* datasets, showing effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT improves recognition in challenging scenarios and provides a foundation for reasoning-based models.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot multimodal approach for Compound Expression Recognition (CER) combines six modalities using CLIP and Qwen-VL, achieving competitive results without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect complex emotional states (compound expressions) without relying on domain-specific training data, leveraging zero-shot learning.

Method: Uses six modalities (facial expressions, scene/label matching, context, audio, text) with CLIP and Qwen-VL, plus MHPF and CE transformation modules.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 46.95% (AffWild2), 49.02% (AFEW), and 34.85% (C-EXPR-DB), comparable to supervised methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures compound emotions without domain adaptation, demonstrating zero-shot viability for CER.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset for Graphical Abstracts (GAs) research, proposing tasks and metrics to improve GA selection and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of GAs in scientific communication and the barrier of advanced visualization skills required for their design.

Method: Introduces SciGA-145k dataset with 145k papers and 1.14M figures, defines Intra-GA and Inter-GA recommendation tasks, and proposes the CAR metric.

Result: Provides baseline models for GA tasks and introduces CAR, a novel metric for fine-grained analysis of GA recommendations.

Conclusion: SciGA-145k advances visual scientific communication and supports AI development for science by unifying tasks and metrics.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [101] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores synthetic data generation for robust object detection in low-data regimes, comparing prompt-based and layout-based conditioning with diffusion models. Layout conditioning outperforms as diversity increases, significantly boosting detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning robust object detectors with limited real-world data, especially in industrial settings where data collection is time-consuming.

Method: Compares two conditioning strategies (prompt-based and layout-based) for synthetic data generation using diffusion models across 80 visual concepts from standard benchmarks.

Result: Layout conditioning excels with diverse cues, improving mean average precision by up to 177% compared to real data alone.

Conclusion: Synthetic data, especially with layout conditioning, is highly effective for enhancing object detection in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT is a binary vision transformer that improves performance by incorporating differential information in attention and using frequency decomposition, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation and reliance on full-precision modules in binary ViTs for edge-device deployment.

Method: Introduces informative attention with differential information, frequency decomposition via Haar wavelet, and improved RPReLU activation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods in image classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT effectively balances efficiency and performance in binary ViTs.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by refining features with flow matching and selective state space models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of few-frame images and redundancy in 3D space, which reduce accuracy for occluded and distant scenes, without needing extra historical data or high computational resources.

Method: Introduces FMOcc with a flow matching SSM module (FMSSM) for feature refinement, TPV SSM layer, and Plane Selective SSM (PS3M) to filter features, plus Mask Training (MT) for robustness.

Result: Achieves 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc, with efficient memory (5.4G) and inference time (330ms).

Conclusion: FMOcc is a robust and efficient solution for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction, excelling in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical enhancement algorithms are limited to single tasks, reducing their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: SurgVisAgent uses a prior model for domain-specific knowledge and employs in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning for customized image enhancements.

Result: Extensive experiments show SurgVisAgent outperforms traditional single-task models in handling diverse surgical distortions.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent offers a unified, effective solution for surgical assistance, enhancing decision-making in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

TL;DR: A multi-label classification framework using aerial imagery for post-hurricane damage assessment, outperforming baselines with 90.23% mean average precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label methods fail to capture the complexity of hurricane damage, necessitating a more accurate and timely assessment for effective disaster response.

Method: Integrates ResNet-based feature extraction and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in aerial images.

Result: Achieves 90.23% mean average precision on the Rescuenet dataset, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework improves damage assessment, aiding targeted disaster response and future mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types

disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference

### [106] [Cross-domain Hyperspectral Image Classification based on Bi-directional Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02268)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, enhancing adaptability and separability by extracting domain-invariant and domain-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images from different regions or times exhibit spectral shifts, making cross-domain classification challenging. The goal is to improve classification accuracy by addressing domain shifts.

Method: The BiDA framework uses a triple-branch transformer architecture (source, target, and coupled branches) with a semantic tokenizer. It employs a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention mechanism and bi-directional distillation loss for feature interaction and adaptive space learning. An Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) is introduced for noise robustness.

Result: BiDA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 3-5% higher accuracy in cross-temporal tree species classification tasks.

Conclusion: The BiDA framework effectively addresses spectral shifts in cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

*Fanghai Yi,Zehong Zheng,Zexiao Liang,Yihang Dong,Xiyang Fang,Wangyu Wu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAC-Lookup, a model for enhancing underwater images by improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from visibility and color issues due to environmental factors, and existing methods (prior-based, pixel-based, or deep learning) are inadequate due to lack of high-quality datasets.

Method: The MAC-Lookup model combines Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial color correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement, avoiding over-enhancement.

Result: Experiments show MAC-Lookup restores details and colors more effectively than existing methods.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup is a robust solution for underwater image enhancement, addressing key challenges while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater

### [108] [Spotlighting Partially Visible Cinematic Language for Video-to-Audio Generation via Self-distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02271)
*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-distillation method to improve Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation by incorporating cinematic language, addressing partial visibility issues and enhancing performance on datasets like VGGSound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods ignore cinematic language, leading to poor performance when Foley targets are partially visible. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A self-distillation approach is proposed, where a student model learns to align video features with audio-visual correspondences by simulating cinematic language variations.

Result: The method improves performance under partial visibility and enhances results on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of current V2A methods by integrating cinematic language, achieving better performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

*Juntao Liu,Liqiang Niu,Wenchao Chen,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaCo introduces layer-wise visual token compression within vision encoders, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods for MLLMs are post-encoder, limiting efficiency gains. LaCo addresses this by compressing tokens within intermediate layers.

Method: LaCo uses a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism and residual learning with non-parametric shortcuts to merge tokens and preserve visual information.

Result: LaCo outperforms existing methods, improving training efficiency by over 20% and inference throughput by over 15% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: LaCo is an effective framework for intermediate-layer token compression, offering significant efficiency and performance benefits.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

### [110] [Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288)
*De Cheng,Zhipeng Xu,Xinyang Jiang,Dongsheng Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for domain generalization (DG) leverages text-guided visual prompt tuning and worst explicit representation alignment (WERA) to enhance domain-invariant feature learning, outperforming state-of-the-art DG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of designing prompts that disentangle invariant features across diverse domains in DG, using the controllable language prompt of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs).

Method: Proposes text feature-guided visual prompt tuning, using LLMs to disentangle text prompts, and introduces WERA to align visual representations with abstract prompts for enhanced diversity and consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major datasets like PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines text-guided disentanglement and visual alignment to improve generalization across unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

*Hanbo Bi,Yulong Xu,Ya Li,Yongqiang Mao,Boyuan Tong,Chongyang Li,Chunbo Lang,Wenhui Diao,Hongqi Wang,Yingchao Feng,Xian Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRefSAM improves SAM's performance in remote sensing by automating prompts and adapting to domain-specific features using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with manual prompts and domain adaptability in remote sensing images, especially for dense or novel objects.

Method: ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder and Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to automate prompts and align domain-specific features.

Result: ViRefSAM outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM effectively addresses SAM's limitations in remote sensing, enabling accurate segmentation of unseen classes with minimal reference images.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ improves novel view synthesis by integrating multi-view conditions into pre-trained diffusion models, enhancing controllability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with controllable novel view generation due to limited multi-view information.

Method: Uses a view-aware 3D lifting module and multi-view feature fusion to integrate 3D representations into diffusion models.

Result: Enhances controllability and quality of novel view synthesis, enabling better 3D object reconstruction.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ advances view-aware diffusion models, broadening applications in 3D synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

### [113] [Flow-CDNet: A Novel Network for Detecting Both Slow and Fast Changes in Bitemporal Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02307)
*Haoxuan Li,Chenxu Wei,Haodong Wang,Xiaomeng Hu,Boyuan An,Lingyan Ran,Baosen Zhang,Jin Jin,Omirzhan Taukebayev,Amirkhan Temirbayev,Junrui Liu,Xiuwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-CDNet detects both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images using a dual-branch network (optical flow and binary change detection) and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow changes in bitemporal images are precursors to major hazards, necessitating a network that detects both slow and fast changes.

Method: Proposes Flow-CDNet with two branches: optical flow for displacement changes and a ResNet-based branch for fast changes, using a new dataset (Flow-Change), loss function (binary tversky + L2), and metric (FEPE).

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Flow-Change dataset; ablation shows mutual enhancement between branches.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet effectively detects slow and fast changes, validated by superior performance and branch synergy.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMPNet discovers semantic keypoints weakly-supervised by category labels, using a novel leaky max pooling layer and clustering for robust, interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover semantic object keypoints without strong supervision, relying only on category labels.

Method: Transforms discriminative filters into keypoint detectors using leaky max pooling (LMP), attention mask-out, and a clustering layer.

Result: LMPNet discovers pose-robust keypoints and matches supervised model accuracy.

Conclusion: LMPNet is an effective, interpretable method for weakly-supervised keypoint discovery.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

*Le Xu,Qi Zhang,Qixian Zhang,Hongyun Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using fMRI representations to improve semantic alignment in brain-vision decoding, enhancing object detection and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained semantic alignment, leading to reconstruction distortions. The study aims to understand visual perception patterns and improve semantic object processing.

Method: An experimental framework injects fMRI representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, comparing performance on object detection and segmentation tasks.

Result: Incorporating fMRI signals improves detection and segmentation accuracy, revealing rich multi-object semantic cues and spatial localization information.

Conclusion: fMRI contains valuable semantic and spatial data that current models underutilize, suggesting potential for better integration in future decoding approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [116] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC is a novel method for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial quality control, addressing background preservation, mask alignment, and semantic validity while enhancing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously meet the demands of preserving normal backgrounds, aligning anomalies with masks, and ensuring semantic validity.

Method: MAGIC fine-tunes Stable Diffusion for inpainting, adds Gaussian prompt-level and spatial noise perturbations, and uses context-aware mask alignment.

Result: MAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MVTec-AD dataset in anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: MAGIC effectively resolves key challenges in anomaly generation, offering a robust solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

TL;DR: SynTVA is a new dataset and benchmark for evaluating synthetic videos' utility in text-to-video retrieval (TVR), focusing on semantic alignment and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V evaluation metrics lack insight into downstream task performance like TVR, prompting the need for a dedicated benchmark.

Method: SynTVA uses 800 user queries to generate synthetic videos, annotating them along four semantic alignment dimensions and correlating VQA metrics with TVR performance.

Result: SynTVA proves useful for dataset augmentation, improving TVR outcomes by selecting high-utility synthetic samples.

Conclusion: SynTVA provides a valuable tool for assessing and enhancing synthetic video utility in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl improves spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by enforcing consistency across all denoising steps, outperforming existing methods like ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ focus on final denoising steps, neglecting intermediate stages, limiting spatial control precision.

Method: InnerControl trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct control signals from intermediate UNet features at every step, using pseudo ground truth for training.

Result: The method enhances control fidelity and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance with diverse conditioning methods.

Conclusion: InnerControl provides a robust solution for precise spatial control in diffusion models, complementing existing techniques.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ANN-based Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) for rice leaf disease classification, comparing it with a Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM). FADM outperforms DICDM, showing potential for improving crop health and yield.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of rice leaf diseases is crucial for effective management and yield improvement, but existing methods lack thorough comparative analysis of feature extraction approaches.

Method: The study compares FADM (using FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and ELM) with DICDM (no FEAs) on datasets of various rice diseases, evaluated via 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: FADM achieves higher classification performance than DICDM, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: FADM is a promising tool for rice disease detection, offering benefits for crop health, yield, and sustainability.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

TL;DR: A two-step neural network method for automated detection of intracranial aneurysm landmarks in the Circle of Willis, achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of arterial bifurcations in the Circle of Willis is crucial for efficient diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms.

Method: Uses a two-step process: an object detection network to identify ROIs, followed by a modified U-Net with deep supervision for precise bifurcation localization.

Result: Achieves the highest performance in bifurcation detection, addressing issues like missed detections and anatomical variability.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for automated landmark detection in cerebral MRA datasets.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Result: Achieves 92.7% mAP@0.5 (3% improvement), 32.3% fewer parameters, and better generalization on URPC2020 dataset.

Conclusion: Balances accuracy and efficiency, offering reliable support for intelligent shrimp disease detection.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

TL;DR: Hita is a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, improving global information capture and training speed with holistic-to-local tokenization and fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of vanilla autoregressive models and tokenizers in capturing holistic relationships and global information in image generation.

Method: Introduces holistic-to-local tokenization with learnable queries, sequential structure with causal attention, and a lightweight fusion module for information flow control.

Result: Achieves 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet, with improved training speed and effectiveness in style transfer and in-painting.

Conclusion: Hita enhances autoregressive image generation by better capturing global properties and outperforms vanilla tokenizers.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the

### [123] [LocalDyGS: Multi-view Global Dynamic Scene Modeling via Adaptive Local Implicit Feature Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02363)
*Jiahao Wu,Rui Peng,Jianbo Jiao,Jiayu Yang,Luyang Tang,Kaiqiang Xiong,Jie Liang,Jinbo Yan,Runling Liu,Ronggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDyGS introduces a novel framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, handling both large-scale and fine-scale motions by decomposing scenes into local spaces and decoupling static/dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like neural radiance fields or 3D Gaussian splatting struggle with complex, highly dynamic motions, limiting their realism and applicability.

Method: The approach decomposes scenes into local spaces with seeds, captures static and dynamic features separately, and combines them to model motion using Temporal Gaussians.

Result: The method outperforms SOTA on fine-scale datasets and is the first to model large, complex dynamic scenes effectively.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS advances dynamic scene reconstruction, offering realistic modeling of highly dynamic real-world scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UVLM introduces an underwater observation benchmark to address gaps in existing video language models, focusing on unique underwater challenges, data diversity, and structured tasks. Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM improves underwater understanding and shows potential for broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video language models (VidLMs) primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, neglecting the demanding needs of underwater observation. UVLM aims to bridge this gap by providing a specialized benchmark.

Method: UVLM is constructed through a collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. It includes videos addressing underwater challenges (light variations, turbidity, viewing angles), diverse data (frame rates, resolutions, marine species), and structured tasks (biological/environmental categories with 20 task types).

Result: Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly enhances underwater world understanding and shows slight improvements on existing in-air benchmarks like VideoMME and Perception text.

Conclusion: UVLM fills a critical gap in VidLM applications for underwater observation, offering a robust benchmark with diverse data and tasks. The release of the dataset and prompt engineering will support further research.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

*Seokyeong Lee,Sithu Aung,Junyong Choi,Seungryong Kim,Ig-Jae Kim,Junghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) using video data, robust to occlusion and scalable without multi-view setups or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity in M3OD by leveraging video data and avoiding costly annotations or additional sensors.

Method: Aggregates pseudo-LiDARs of static and dynamic objects across frames using object point tracking for 3D attribute extraction.

Result: Ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is practical and effective for M3OD, overcoming limitations of prior weakly supervised methods.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMEL introduces a continual MIL framework for localization with minimal forgetting, outperforming prior methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of adaptability in MIL for continual tasks, especially in instance classification for localization, given the challenges of large patches and no global relationships.

Method: Proposes CoMEL with GDAT for instance encoding, BPPL for pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to mitigate forgetting in classification.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by up to 11.00% in bag-level accuracy and 23.4% in localization accuracy on WSI datasets.

Conclusion: CoMEL effectively addresses continual MIL challenges, offering improved localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim,Jongwook Choi,Yonghyun Jeong,Haeun Noh,Jaejun Yoo,Seungryul Baek,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deepfake detection method using pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies and a joint transformer module for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detectors miss temporal artifacts by focusing on spatial frequency spectra. This method aims to detect unnatural movements in videos.

Method: Uses 1D Fourier transform on the time axis per pixel, an attention proposal module, and a joint transformer to integrate temporal and spatial features.

Result: Significantly improves detection of deepfake videos by capturing temporal inconsistencies and forgery artifacts.

Conclusion: The framework advances deepfake detection, offering robust performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

### [128] [TABNet: A Triplet Augmentation Self-Recovery Framework with Boundary-Aware Pseudo-Labels for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02399)
*Peilin Zhang,Shaouxan Wua,Jun Feng,Zhuo Jin,Zhizezhang Gao,Jingkun Chen,Yaqiong Xing,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAB Net, a weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, uses triplet augmentation and boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision to improve scribble-based segmentation, achieving results close to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble annotations are cost-effective but lack sufficient boundary supervision, limiting segmentation performance. TAB Net addresses this by enhancing feature learning and boundary modeling.

Method: TAB Net includes the TAS module (triplet augmentation for feature learning) and the BAP module (boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision for contour refinement).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art scribble-based methods on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets, nearing fully supervised performance.

Conclusion: TAB Net effectively leverages sparse scribble annotations for high-quality medical image segmentation, bridging the gap with fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

*Mufhumudzi Muthivhi,Terence L. van Zyl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification, showing it outperforms supervised methods in robustness and performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife re-identification relies on annotated data, which is resource-intensive. SSL offers a way to leverage unlabeled data for training.

Method: Uses temporal image pairs from camera traps to train a self-supervised model without supervision, then evaluates it against supervised models.

Result: SSL models are more robust with limited data and outperform supervised features in all downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising alternative to supervised learning for wildlife re-identification, reducing reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper integrates an encoder with a diffusion model to create an auto-encoding framework, enabling image-specific representations and structured latent space for brain image analysis and artifact restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack explicit semantic representation extraction, unlike auto-encoders. Combining them allows structured latent space and better image analysis.

Method: Integrates an encoder with diffusion models, enforces latent space organization for brain image patterns, and develops unsupervised artifact restoration techniques.

Result: Structured latent space for brain tissue differentiation, unsupervised tear artifact restoration, and JPEG artifact restoration using diffusion model capabilities.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances diffusion models with auto-encoder benefits, enabling structured representations and effective artifact restoration.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking in thermal images, optimizing hyperparameters to improve accuracy without complex models, validated on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images are crucial for surveillance in low-visibility conditions, but their low-level features make pedestrian tracking challenging.

Method: A two-stage tuning method is proposed, optimizing hyperparameters for each stage to enhance tracking performance in thermal imagery.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy in pedestrian tracking across various thermal camera conditions, as shown in experiments on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset.

Conclusion: The framework is a robust solution for real-world surveillance, effectively addressing the challenges of thermal image tracking.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

TL;DR: PFIP is a novel scheme for efficient face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the time-intensive nature of face retrieval in ciphertext domains due to growing template libraries and privacy concerns.

Method: Proposes PFIP with a preselection mechanism and packing module to enhance efficiency and flexibility.

Result: Achieves 100% hit rate, retrieves 1,000 ciphertext templates in 300ms, and improves efficiency by 50x.

Conclusion: PFIP successfully balances privacy preservation and computational efficiency in face identification systems.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crack detection is slow and error-prone, risking public safety. This study aims to enhance reliability through automated deep-learning solutions.

Method: Utilized residual U-Net models integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model of convolutional blocks, evaluated against SegNet and traditional U-Net.

Result: The ensemble model outperformed individual models, achieving the highest IoU and DICE scores, especially with low-resolution images.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble model offers a reliable solution for automated structural crack detection, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarMakeup is a 3D makeup method for virtual avatars, using a diffusion model to transfer makeup from a reference photo while ensuring consistency, identity preservation, and fine detail control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian editing methods lack realism in makeup effects for avatars, failing in consistency, identity preservation, and detail control.

Method: AvatarMakeup uses a pretrained diffusion model for makeup transfer, employing a coarse-to-fine approach with Coherent Duplication for consistency and a Refinement Module for detail enhancement.

Result: Experiments show AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality and consistency in animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing realistic and consistent makeup for 3D avatars.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing methods that rely on textual cues and neglect visual context, leading to incoherent outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models for character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization, along with scene-level segmentation and subtasks (highlight detection, opening/ending selection, pruning). Introduces DramaAD dataset for benchmarking.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, narrowing the gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Conclusion: HIVE effectively improves automatic video editing by leveraging multimodal understanding and structured subtasks, validated by superior performance on the DramaAD dataset.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F¬≤TTA) for medical data, addressing unpredictable domain shifts in fragmented data. It proposes Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) with Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) to improve adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt source models to unpredictable domain fragments in medical data, where shifts occur arbitrarily, overcoming limitations of existing TTA methods.

Method: Proposes I-DiPT with UoM for masked consistency learning and PGD for reusing historical prompt knowledge via parallel graph networks.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA methods in breast cancer and glaucoma classification tasks.

Conclusion: I-DiPT with UoM and PGD effectively addresses F¬≤TTA challenges, demonstrating superior performance in medical image adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

Result: MobileNet v1 achieved 98% success rate and 6611 FPS, proving FPGAs can speed up ANNs for attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: FPGAs effectively accelerate ANNs, making them suitable for real-time robotic applications.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

### [138] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a Zero-Shot method for underexposed image enhancement without needing paired training data, addressing over-enhancement and noise issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods require impractical paired datasets and often over-enhance images.

Method: IGDNet uses a decomposition module (separates illumination/reflection) and a denoising module (illumination-guided correction). Noise pairs are refined iteratively.

Result: Outperforms 14 unsupervised methods with PSNR (20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) on four datasets.

Conclusion: IGDNet is effective for enhancing underexposed images without training data, improving visual quality.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

### [139] [Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02844)
*Ziqi Miao,Yi Ding,Lijun Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisCo Attack, a visual-centric jailbreak method for MLLMs, achieving high toxicity and success rates by dynamically generating contextual dialogue and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic and grounded visual-centric jailbreak scenarios in existing attacks on MLLMs.

Method: Proposes VisCo Attack, which uses four visual-focused strategies, automatic toxicity obfuscation, and semantic refinement to construct realistic jailbreak contexts.

Result: Achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an ASR of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: VisCo Attack effectively exploits visual vulnerabilities in MLLMs, demonstrating the need for improved security measures.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

### [140] [Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02454)
*Weiwei Duan,Luping Ji,Shengjia Chen,Sicheng Zhu,Jianghong Huang,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme for moving infrared small target detection, reducing reliance on manual annotations and achieving performance close to fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for infrared small target detection is costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for non-fully supervised approaches to reduce annotation requirements.

Method: The WeCoL scheme uses target quantity prompts, integrates a potential target mining strategy with SAM, employs contrastive learning for pseudo-label reliability, and introduces a motion-aware learning scheme.

Result: Experiments on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets show the weakly-supervised method outperforms early fully-supervised ones and reaches over 90% of SOTA fully-supervised performance.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly-supervised approach effectively reduces annotation dependency while maintaining high detection performance, offering a practical alternative to fully-supervised methods.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh Silksong is an efficient mesh representation method that reduces token sequence redundancy by 50% and achieves a 22% compression rate, while improving geometric properties like manifold topology and watertight detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh tokenization methods waste network capability with repeated vertex tokens, prompting the need for a more efficient representation.

Method: Mesh Silksong tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each vertex only once, reducing redundancy and improving compression.

Result: The method achieves a 50% reduction in token sequence redundancy and a 22% compression rate, with superior geometric properties.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong effectively generates intricate meshes with improved geometric integrity, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

### [142] [CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02479)
*Teng Fu,Yuwen Chen,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CrowdTrack,' a large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex scenarios, addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack complexity and realism, hindering the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging scenarios.

Method: A new dataset (CrowdTrack) is created with 33 videos (5,185 trajectories) from real-life, first-person views, annotated with bounding boxes and unique IDs.

Result: The dataset enables testing of SOTA models and foundation models, providing insights into their performance in complex situations.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack serves as a valuable resource for advancing multi-pedestrian tracking algorithms in real-world, complex environments.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFormer is an efficient medical vision transformer addressing task-specific limitations and computational inefficiencies in medical image recognition, using a pyramid scaling structure and Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision transformer methods in medical imaging are task-specific and computationally expensive, limiting their general applicability and performance.

Method: MedFormer introduces a pyramid scaling structure for hierarchical feature representation and DSSA for efficient, content-aware attention, enhancing performance and reducing computational costs.

Result: Experiments show MedFormer outperforms existing methods in image classification, semantic segmentation, and lesion detection across various datasets.

Conclusion: MedFormer offers a versatile, efficient solution for medical image recognition, improving performance and computational efficiency while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

*Luca Parolari,Andrea Cherubini,Lamberto Ballan,Carlo Biffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a supervised contrastive loss method with temporally-aware soft targets for polyp counting in colonoscopy, improving clustering robustness and reducing fragmentation rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated polyp counting enhances colonoscopy screening cost-effectiveness, but existing methods neglect temporal relationships in tracklet feature learning and clustering.

Method: Introduces a supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets and integrates a temporal adjacency constraint for tracklet clustering.

Result: Achieves a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is crucial for polyp counting, and the proposed method significantly improves performance.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-INR is a novel neural framework addressing limitations of existing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) by handling multivariate data on unstructured grids, using meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic re-clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INRs struggle with complex structures, single-variable focus, and structured grid dependency, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: MC-INR combines meta-learning, clustering, and a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism. It also uses a branched layer for multivariate data.

Result: MC-INR outperforms existing methods in scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR effectively addresses INR limitations, offering improved performance for complex real-world datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large public datasets for low-light RGB pedestrian detection by leveraging infrared data.

Method: 1) Infrared detection, 2) Label transfer to RGB, 3) Training detection models using autolabels.

Result: Models trained on autolabels outperformed ground-truth labels in 6/9 cases for mAP@50 and mAP@50-95.

Conclusion: Automated labeling pipeline is effective for low-light pedestrian detection, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to

Motivation: To optimize genetic selection in aquaculture by automating and improving the accuracy of shrimp morphological analysis.

Method: Uses modified ResNet-50 for view classification and rostrum detection, VitPose for pose estimation, and SVM for pixel-to-centimeter conversion.

Result: Reduces human error significantly (0% in view classification, 3.64% in rostrum detection), achieves 97.94% mAP in pose estimation, and 0.07 cm conversion error.

Conclusion: IMASHRIMP effectively automates shrimp morphology analysis, enhancing genetic selection efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological

TL;DR: MoGe-2 is an advanced model for metric-scale 3D point map recovery from a single image, improving upon MoGe by maintaining relative geometry accuracy while achieving precise metric scale and fine-grained detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without losing relative geometry accuracy and address noise/errors in real data that degrade fine-grained detail.

Method: Extends MoGe with strategies for metric prediction and introduces a unified data refinement approach using synthetic labels to enhance detail.

Result: Superior performance in accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: MoGe-2 successfully achieves simultaneous capabilities in relative geometry, metric scale, and fine-grained detail, advancing monocular geometry estimation.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

TL;DR: A dual-branch optimization framework is proposed to reconstruct accurate human interactions in videos by leveraging human appearance cues, proxemics, and physical constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods struggle with visual ambiguities and occlusions in close human interactions, even advanced models like SAM. Human appearance is identified as a key cue to address these challenges.

Method: A diffusion model learns proxemic behavior and pose priors. A dual-branch optimization framework, incorporating trained networks and optimizable tensors, reconstructs motions and appearances using constraints like 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations.

Result: The method accurately estimates interactions in complex environments, validated by benchmarks. A dataset with pseudo ground-truth annotations is also introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in pose estimation for close interactions, with potential to advance research in human behavior understanding.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

### [151] [Parametric shape models for vessels learned from segmentations via differentiable voxelization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02576)
*Alina F. Dima,Suprosanna Shit,Huaqi Qiu,Robbie Holland,Tamara T. Mueller,Fabio Antonio Musio,Kaiyuan Yang,Bjoern Menze,Rickmer Braren,Marcus Makowski,Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework integrates voxel, mesh, and parametric representations of vessels using differentiable transformations, enabling automatic shape parameter extraction from segmentations without ground-truth shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel representations (voxel, mesh, parametric) are used disjointly despite their complementary strengths. The goal is to unify them for seamless, high-fidelity modeling.

Method: Differentiable voxelization extracts parametric shape models (centerlines and radii via cubic B-splines) from segmentations. Meshes are then differentiably derived from these parameters.

Result: The method accurately models complex vessels (aortas, aneurysms, brain vessels) with smooth, continuous shapes and manipulable meshes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies multiple vessel representations, enabling flexible and accurate modeling without requiring ground-truth shape parameters.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and

### [152] [Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency for 3D Medical Image Self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02581)
*Tan Pan,Zhaorui Tan,Kaiyu Guo,Dongli Xu,Weidi Xu,Chen Jiang,Xin Guo,Yuan Qi,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $S^2DC$, a structure-aware self-supervised learning framework for 3D medical images, improving semantic discrepancy and consistency to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mSSL methods use fixed-size patches, ignoring anatomical structure variations, which are crucial for meaningful distinctions in medical analysis.

Method: $S^2DC$ enforces semantic discrepancy via optimal transport and ensures semantic consistency using neighborhood similarity distribution, bridging patch and structure levels.

Result: Evaluated on 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, $S^2DC$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mSSL methods.

Conclusion: $S^2DC$ effectively captures structure-aware representations, advancing 3D medical image analysis.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

*Weili Xu,Enxin Song,Wenhao Chai,Xuexiang Wen,Tian Ye,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuroraLong replaces LLMs with linear RNNs for efficient long video understanding, achieving comparable performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational complexity and memory costs of transformer-based LLMs for long video understanding.

Method: Uses a linear RNN language model with constant-size hidden states and combines visual token merge for efficiency.

Result: Achieves performance similar to Transformer-based models with only 2B parameters and public data training.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by reducing computational barriers.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

*Riccardo Gallon,Fabian Schiemenz,Alessandra Menicucci,Eberhard Gill*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting sensor faults in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) for space missions by using AI, focusing on creating a synthetic dataset of fault-injected images to train and test fault detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor faults in VBN can compromise mission reliability, but traditional fault detection methods are limited. AI offers a solution, though lack of representative datasets is a barrier.

Method: The study analyzes fault cases in camera sensors, characterizes their causes and effects, and introduces a simulation framework to generate synthetic faulty images.

Result: A dataset of fault-injected images is created, aiding AI-based fault detection algorithm development.

Conclusion: The synthetic dataset addresses the lack of real faulty data, enabling robust AI solutions for fault detection in VBN.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Holmes-Set, a dataset for AI-generated image (AIGI) detection, and Holmes Pipeline, a training framework for MLLMs to detect AIGI with human-verifiable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misuse of AI-generated images in misinformation by improving detection with explainability and generalization.

Method: Develop Holmes-Set (Holmes-SFTSet and Holmes-DPOSet) and Holmes Pipeline (three-stage training: pre-training, fine-tuning, preference optimization).

Result: AIGI-Holmes model shows effectiveness in benchmarks, with improved generalization and human-aligned explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset enhance AIGI detection, offering verifiable explanations and better generalization.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

*Charlesquin Kemajou Mbakam,Jonathan Spence,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a diffusion model (DM) into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling, improving accuracy and efficiency while retaining flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between zero-shot Plug-and-Play methods (flexible but approximate) and specialized conditional DMs (accurate but task-specific) in Bayesian computational imaging.

Method: Deep unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (LATINO Langevin sampler) combined with model distillation to create a few-step conditional model.

Result: The proposed method achieves excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches while adapting to forward model variations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates deep unfolding and distillation, offering a flexible and efficient solution for posterior sampling in computational imaging.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT is a framework to mitigate overfitting in personalized diffusion models using adaptive training strategies and representation regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and text alignment degradation in limited-data personalization of diffusion models.

Method: APT includes Adaptive Training Adjustment, Representation Stabilization, and Attention Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation.

Result: APT effectively reduces overfitting, preserves prior knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating diverse, high-quality images.

Conclusion: APT successfully addresses key challenges in personalizing diffusion models with limited data.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

*Xiangyang Luo,Ye Zhu,Yunfei Liu,Lijian Lin,Cong Wan,Zijian Cai,Shao-Lun Huang,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap decouples facial motion and appearance for video face swapping, improving identity transfer and dynamic attribute preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining dynamic attributes like head poses and expressions while swapping identities in videos.

Method: CanonSwap decouples motion from appearance, modifies identity in a canonical space, and reintegrates features. It uses a Partial Identity Modulation module for precise identity transfer.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation.

Conclusion: CanonSwap effectively addresses the coupling of facial appearance and motion, achieving superior video face-swapping results.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIU3R is an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding from unposed images, outperforming existing methods by unifying tasks with shared 3D representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D-to-3D feature alignment methods limit 3D understanding and lose semantic information, prompting the need for an alignment-free approach.

Method: SIU3R uses pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified learnable queries to avoid 2D alignment, with lightweight modules for task collaboration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both individual and combined tasks of 3D reconstruction and understanding.

Conclusion: The alignment-free framework and mutual benefit designs of SIU3R effectively enhance simultaneous 3D tasks.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMC, a DiT-based framework for unifying controllable multi-class image generation, and HAIG-2.9M, a dataset for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint-guided models struggle with non-rigid objects and overlapping instances due to method limitations and lack of suitable datasets.

Method: UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens. HAIG-2.9M provides a large-scale, annotated dataset for training.

Result: UniMC effectively handles heavy occlusions and multi-class scenarios, and HAIG-2.9M is shown to be high-quality and diverse.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset address key challenges in keypoint-guided image generation, improving performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

TL;DR: FairHuman improves human image generation by balancing global and local objectives using multi-objective fine-tuning and MPD criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating human images with plausible details (e.g., faces, hands) is challenging due to insufficient local supervision during training.

Method: Proposes FairHuman: constructs global and local objectives (for hands and faces), uses MPD criterion for fair optimization.

Result: Significant improvements in local detail generation while maintaining overall quality.

Conclusion: FairHuman effectively enhances human image generation across scenarios.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel framework combines foundation models with weak supervision (bounding box annotations) to automate segmentation, outperforming fully and weakly supervised methods with an 84.90% Dice score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise annotations in medical imaging are costly; weakly supervised methods using bounding boxes offer a practical alternative.

Method: Automates prompt generation for foundation models using bounding box annotations, integrating constraints and pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves an average Dice score of 84.90%, surpassing existing methods in limited data settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces annotation burden while maintaining high segmentation performance.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: Limited research exists on functional grasping with large models for dexterous hands due to data collection challenges.

Method: Generates a dataset of 170M grasp poses (DexGraspNet 3.0) and trains a VLM with flow-matching-based pose head for instruction-aligned grasp prediction.

Result: Achieves 76% zero-shot success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation, with successful real-world application.

Conclusion: DexVLG demonstrates robust performance in dexterous grasp prediction, bridging the gap for human-like hand control in robotics.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: MANO introduces a linear-complexity Transformer variant for high-resolution inputs, inspired by n-body simulations, achieving competitive performance with reduced runtime and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have quadratic complexity, making them impractical for high-resolution inputs. Existing solutions often lose fine details.

Method: MANO treats attention as an interaction problem between grid points, using distance-based multiscale computation for linear complexity.

Result: MANO matches ViT and Swin Transformer performance while drastically reducing runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: MANO offers an efficient alternative to standard Transformers for high-resolution tasks, with open-sourced code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

TL;DR: Proposes a Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance, outperforming weakly supervised methods and matching semi-supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for oriented object detection datasets are a barrier; existing methods (fully, semi-, or weakly supervised) are either expensive or inefficient.

Method: Introduces PWOOD framework using partial weak annotations (horizontal boxes or points), OS-Student model for learning orientation/scale with minimal annotations, and CPF strategy to reduce sensitivity to thresholds.

Result: PWOOD outperforms weakly supervised methods and matches/surpasses semi-supervised algorithms on DOTA and DIOR datasets.

Conclusion: PWOOD offers a cost-effective solution for oriented object detection, balancing performance and annotation efficiency.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

*Danrong Zhang,Huili Huang,N. Simrill Smith,Nimisha Roy,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a semantic segmentation approach for assessing earthquake damage severity in social media images, improving objectivity and precision over traditional classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage severity assessments are subjective and lack granularity. This study aims to provide a more objective and nuanced analysis of damage in earthquake-affected areas.

Method: The study constructs a segmented damage severity dataset (undamaged, damaged, debris) and fine-tunes a SegFormer model for semantic segmentation. A new scoring system quantifies damage severity, adjusted for depth.

Result: The approach enables more objective and comprehensive damage severity quantification in social media images, aiding disaster reconnaissance.

Conclusion: The method enhances precision in damage assessment, improving guidance for disaster response teams and facilitating targeted efforts post-earthquake.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to

*Liheng Zhang,Lexi Pang,Hang Ye,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible feature injection framework for text-to-image diffusion models improves structural alignment and visual quality without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature injection methods for conditional image generation suffer from structural misalignment and artifacts, especially with non-RGB conditions.

Method: Proposes a decoupled feature injection framework with a structure-rich module, appearance-rich prompting, and restart refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditioning scenarios with better structural and appearance control.

Conclusion: The framework enables training-free, high-quality generation with improved alignment and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

*Miguel Espinosa,Chenhongyi Yang,Linus Ericsson,Steven McDonagh,Elliot J. Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for object segmentation using reference images and semantic priors from foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the manual effort in generating prompts for image segmentation by leveraging reference images and semantic priors.

Method: A multi-stage, training-free approach involving memory bank construction, representation aggregation, and semantic-aware feature matching.

Result: Significant improvements on segmentation metrics, outperforming existing methods on COCO FSOD, PASCAL VOC Few-Shot, and Cross-Domain FSOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates segmentation mask generation using reference images and semantic priors, advancing few-shot segmentation performance.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. B√ºhler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperGaussians extend 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars, improving expressivity and handling complex deformations and details better than 3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current animatable face avatars from monocular videos struggle with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting, and fine details. The paper aims to enhance the 3D Gaussian representation itself for better expressivity.

Method: Introduces HyperGaussians, high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians conditioned on a learnable local embedding, and an 'inverse covariance trick' to make splatting efficient.

Result: HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, especially for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, and complex facial movements.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians offer a superior alternative to 3DGS for animatable face avatars, addressing key limitations in expressivity and detail handling.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

*Fangfu Liu,Hao Li,Jiawei Chi,Hanyang Wang,Minghui Yang,Fudong Wang,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangScene-X is a generative framework for 3D scene reconstruction and understanding from sparse views, using a TriMap diffusion model and Language Quantized Compressor (LQC) for cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on dense-view reconstruction, leading to artifacts and poor semantics with limited views. LangScene-X aims to overcome this by unifying 3D multi-modality generation.

Method: Uses a TriMap video diffusion model for RGB, normals, and segmentation maps from sparse inputs. LQC encodes language embeddings for cross-scene generalization. Language surface fields align language info to 3D scenes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and generalizability on real-world data.

Conclusion: LangScene-X enables robust 3D reconstruction and open-vocabulary understanding from sparse views, advancing scene synthesis and language integration.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DCDP-HAR, a framework for multimodal HAR, addressing cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions using dual-path feature extraction, contrastive learning, and confidence-driven gradient modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal HAR systems face challenges in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions, hindering performance.

Method: DCDP-HAR uses dual-path (ResNet/DenseNet) feature extraction, multi-stage contrastive learning, and confidence-driven gradient modulation with momentum-based gradient accumulation.

Result: Validated via ablation studies and outperforms on four public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR effectively addresses key challenges in multimodal HAR, improving performance and stability.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes USAD, a multi-attention-based approach for human activity recognition, addressing data scarcity and feature extraction challenges with unsupervised data augmentation and spatio-temporal attention networks, achieving high accuracy on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in HAR like labeled data scarcity, poor feature extraction, and suboptimal performance on lightweight devices.

Method: Uses unsupervised data augmentation, a multi-branch spatio-temporal network with attention mechanisms, and adaptive multi-loss fusion.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% on WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: USAD is effective for HAR, with practical feasibility on embedded devices.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: AnyI2V is a training-free framework for animating images with user-defined motion, supporting diverse inputs like meshes and point clouds, and enabling flexible video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V and I2V methods lack precise spatial and motion control, and are limited by text prompts or real images. AnyI2V addresses these gaps.

Method: Proposes AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates conditional images with motion trajectories, supports mixed inputs, and allows style transfer via LoRA and text.

Result: AnyI2V achieves superior performance in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation, supporting diverse modalities.

Conclusion: AnyI2V offers a flexible, versatile solution for video generation, advancing beyond current T2V and I2V limitations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

### [174] [Bootstrapping Grounded Chain-of-Thought in Multimodal LLMs for Data-Efficient Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02859)
*Jiaer Xia,Bingkui Tong,Yuhang Zang,Rui Shao,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training MLLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data improves adaptation to specialized vision tasks, but CoT data often contains factual errors. The proposed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) method injects grounding information (bounding boxes) to enhance reasoning faithfulness, showing significant improvements in data-limited regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with specialized vision tasks due to dataset mismatch. CoT data helps adaptation but suffers from factual errors in reasoning steps.

Method: Propose GCoT, a bootstrapping-based approach that adds grounding information (bounding boxes) to CoT data to improve reasoning faithfulness.

Result: Evaluated on five specialized vision tasks (charts, tables, receipts, reports), GCoT outperforms fine-tuning and distillation in data-limited settings.

Conclusion: GCoT effectively addresses factual errors in CoT data, enhancing MLLM adaptation to specialized vision tasks with limited data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational costs limit the adoption of video generation models. EasyCache aims to democratize these technologies by addressing these bottlenecks.

Method: EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism to avoid redundant computations during inference, requiring no offline profiling or parameter tuning.

Result: The framework achieves up to 3.3√ó faster inference and a 36% PSNR improvement over prior methods, maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: EasyCache is an efficient, accessible solution for high-quality video generation, suitable for both research and practical applications.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Motivation: To create editable, realistic 3D replicas of indoor environments for AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins.

Method: Uses scene understanding, structured scene graphs, 3D model retrieval, material painting, and simulation engine integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on Scan2CAD and robust material transfer under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: LiteReality produces compact, editable, and realistic 3D scenes suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

TL;DR: Point3R introduces an online framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction using explicit spatial pointer memory to avoid information loss in earlier frames, achieving competitive performance with low training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dense 3D reconstruction rely on implicit memory, which has limited capacity and risks losing earlier frame information. Point3R addresses this by using explicit spatial pointers.

Method: Point3R maintains an explicit spatial pointer memory linked to 3D scene structure, aggregates scene information, and interacts with the latest frame using 3D hierarchical position embedding and a fusion mechanism.

Result: The method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

Conclusion: Point3R effectively addresses limitations of implicit memory in dense 3D reconstruction, offering a robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

TL;DR: RefTok, a reference-based tokenization method, improves video model performance by capturing temporal dynamics and contextual information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video models fail to capture temporal dependencies and redundancies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RefTok encodes and decodes frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame, preserving motion continuity and object appearance.

Result: RefTok outperforms Cosmos and MAGVIT by 36.7% in metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and improves video generation by 27.9%.

Conclusion: RefTok effectively addresses temporal redundancy in videos, enhancing model performance and generation quality.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a multi-task Chinese bias evaluation benchmark for LLMs, addressing gaps in existing datasets by covering diverse bias categories and tasks. It evaluates popular LLMs, revealing varying biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are limited to English/North American culture and lack multi-task support, creating a need for a Chinese-focused, comprehensive benchmark.

Method: Developed McBE with 4,077 instances, 12 bias categories, 82 subcategories, and 5 evaluation tasks to assess LLMs. Evaluated multiple popular LLMs.

Result: All evaluated LLMs exhibited varying degrees of bias, with detailed analysis providing new insights.

Conclusion: McBE fills a critical gap in bias evaluation for Chinese LLMs, offering a versatile tool for comprehensive bias assessment and mitigation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs for dialogue summarization, finding that stepwise reasoning often leads to verbosity and inconsistencies, contrary to trends in other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue summarization is valuable for customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI, but the effectiveness of reasoning LLMs in this context is unexplored.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs across three paradigms (generic, role-oriented, query-oriented) using benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, QMSum) and advanced metrics.

Result: Reasoning LLMs often produce verbose, inconsistent, and less concise summaries compared to non-reasoning LLMs, contrary to expectations.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have limitations in dialogue summarization, requiring targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for real-world applications.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning emerges in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, finding limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT and inconsistent probing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if latent reasoning structures exist in Huginn-3.5B, a model designed to internalize reasoning without externalizing steps, improving efficiency over traditional CoT methods.

Method: Probing techniques like Logit Lens and Coda Lens were used to analyze the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks, tracking rank trajectories of tokens.

Result: Limited interpretable latent CoT was found, with probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks. Increasing recurrence depth provided marginal gains, underperforming explicit CoT models.

Conclusion: Latent CoT in Huginn-3.5B is less interpretable and effective than explicit CoT, highlighting challenges in internalizing reasoning without external steps.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot is an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert natural language descriptions into GDC cohort filters, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to navigate complex cohort creation in GDC; natural language input could simplify this.

Method: Developed and evaluated multiple LLMs, including a locally-served open-source model, to generate GDC cohort filters from natural language.

Result: The locally-served GDC Cohort LLM outperformed GPT-4o in generating accurate cohorts.

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot effectively bridges the gap between natural language and complex cohort creation in GDC.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

TL;DR: MemAgent optimizes long-text tasks with a novel workflow, achieving strong performance on large-scale tasks with minimal degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling infinitely long documents efficiently without performance loss is a key challenge in long-text processing.

Method: Introduces MemAgent, which processes text in segments and updates memory with an overwrite strategy, extending the DAPO algorithm for training.

Result: Achieves <5% performance loss on a 3.5M QA task and 95%+ on a 512K RULER test, extrapolating from 8K to 32K contexts.

Conclusion: MemAgent demonstrates robust long-context capabilities, addressing the challenge of long-text processing effectively.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: DoMIX introduces a novel approach for continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) using LoRA modules, addressing computational costs, domain order sensitivity, and providing task-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual DAP methods are computationally expensive, sensitive to data order, and lack task-specific adaptability.

Method: Leverages LoRA modules for efficient, parallel, and order-robust domain-adaptive pre-training, extending to standard LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Efficient and tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks, with applicability beyond DAP.

Conclusion: DoMIX effectively overcomes limitations of continual DAP, offering a scalable and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

### [186] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT replaces classical FFNs in BERT with PQCs, achieving higher accuracy and parameter efficiency, especially in few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFNs dominate Transformer parameter counts; PQCs offer a parameter-efficient, expressive alternative.

Method: Replace FFNs with PQCs, using residual connections, $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and alternating entanglement.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves 102% baseline accuracy, reduces FFN parameters by 99%, and excels in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: PQCs, when co-designed with deep learning principles, are powerful and efficient alternatives to classical FFNs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

TL;DR: A method using a parametric model for code data selection improves training efficiency and model performance by focusing on data quality, outperforming baselines with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods prioritize data quantity over quality, reducing training efficiency. The paper addresses this by improving data selection.

Method: Introduces a parametric model for code data selection, optimizing for distribution consistency and diversity in the subset.

Result: Achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) with only 10K samples, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances model performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks seven Akan ASR models using diverse datasets, revealing domain dependency and distinct error behaviors between Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating ASR models' generalization across diverse speech contexts, particularly for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Benchmarked seven transformer-based Akan ASR models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2) using four diverse Akan speech corpora, analyzing word and character error rates.

Result: Models performed best within their training domains but degraded in mismatched scenarios. Whisper produced fluent but misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 had obvious but less interpretable errors.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive routing, and multilingual training are needed for low-resource languages like Akan, considering the trade-off between error readability and transparency.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

TL;DR: WebSailor introduces a post-training method to enhance LLMs' ability to handle high-uncertainty tasks, matching proprietary models like DeepResearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in open-source LLMs' ability to systematically reduce uncertainty in complex information-seeking tasks.

Method: Uses structured sampling, information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and the DUPO algorithm for agentic RL training.

Result: WebSailor outperforms open-source agents and matches proprietary agents in complex tasks.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively bridges the capability gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,G√∂ran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias A√üenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional supervised learning and active learning by incorporating human label variation (HLV) as an informative signal, proposing a framework for HLV-aware active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current annotation frameworks assume a single ground truth, overlooking HLV, and active learning often relies on impractical assumptions. The paper aims to better reflect real-world annotation complexities.

Method: The paper decomposes label variation into signal (HLV) and noise, surveys existing approaches, and proposes a conceptual framework for HLV-aware active learning, including instance selection and annotator choice.

Result: A conceptual framework is introduced to integrate HLV into active learning, addressing practical challenges and leveraging large language models as annotators.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for HLV-aware active learning, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging HLV to improve real-world annotation practices.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

TL;DR: MPF is a posttraining alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by leveraging multiperspective generations and interpretable baselines, achieving alignment with minimal KL divergence and calibration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for easy bias mitigation in LLMs without extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Method: Uses the SAGED pipeline to construct bias benchmarks, decomposes baselines into interpretable components, and guides generation through weighted sampling.

Result: Aligns LLM outputs with counterfactual and HR baselines, reducing KL divergence and calibration error while generalizing to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF provides a scalable, interpretable, and deployable solution for bias mitigation in LLMs.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of scientific publications makes peer review challenging, and LLMs' potential to assist in identifying limitations is understudied.

Method: Developed LimitGen benchmark with synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written (LimitGen-Human) datasets, augmented with literature retrieval to improve LLMs' limitation identification.

Result: The approach enhances LLMs' ability to generate concrete and constructive feedback on research limitations.

Conclusion: LimitGen provides a foundation for LLMs to support early-stage peer review by effectively identifying and addressing research limitations.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper measures the 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD) in vowel mimicry, finding it ranges between 14-51 mels, with implications for speech production theories and vowel system structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the accuracy of sub-phonemic control in vowel production by measuring the smallest auditory distance (JPD) required for reliably different imitations.

Method: A vowel mimicry paradigm was used to estimate JPD among English speakers during front vowel production.

Result: JPD was found to range between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into speech production mechanisms and set a theoretical lower bound for vowel phoneme proximity in formant space.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

Motivation: To study why LLMs fail to self-correct errors in their outputs despite identifying them in user inputs, aiming to improve reliability.

Method: Introduced Self-Correction Bench, a framework with controlled error injection at three complexity levels, tested on 14 models.

Result: Found a 64.5% blind spot rate, linked to training data composition. Adding 'Wait' reduced blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical LLM limitation and suggests training data adjustments or prompts like 'Wait' to improve reliability.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs with reasoning capabilities (CoT or fine-tuned) are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning capabilities in RLMs affect their robustness to social biases, using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art RLMs using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, automated safety scoring, and jailbreak techniques to assess bias elicitation.

Result: Reasoning-enabled models are more vulnerable to bias, with CoT prompting being particularly prone to attacks. Fine-tuned models are somewhat safer but still exhibit risks.

Conclusion: Reasoning may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning design.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

*Wenhao Shi,Zhiqiang Hu,Yi Bin,Yang Yang,See-Kiong Ng,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MathV-DP, a dataset with diverse solution trajectories for image-question pairs, and Qwen-VL-DP, a model fine-tuned with GRPO, improving accuracy and diversity in multimodal mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for mathematical reasoning lack diversity in reasoning perspectives and internal reflections, relying on single-solution supervision.

Method: Proposes MathV-DP dataset and Qwen-VL-DP model, fine-tuned with supervised learning and GRPO, integrating correctness and diversity-aware rewards.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP outperforms prior MLLMs in accuracy and generative diversity on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse perspectives and reflective reasoning enhances multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

*Wencheng Zhang,Shiqin Qiao,Lingjie Luo,Yinfeng Li,Chuanyang Zheng,Qian Xu,Meng Li,Yong Gui,Yijun He,Jianing Qiu,Jindong Hong,Jiankai Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynapseRoute, a dynamic routing framework for LLMs that optimizes cost and performance by assigning queries to either high-reasoning or low-cost modes based on complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance performance and operational cost in LLMs, especially with the cost gap between high-reasoning and low-cost modes, motivated this work.

Method: Proposed SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based framework that dynamically routes queries to appropriate modes (thinking or non-thinking) based on problem complexity.

Result: SynapseRoute improved accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduced inference time by 36.8%, and token consumption by 39.66%. Over-reasoning on simpler queries was avoided.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing optimizes accuracy, cost, and user experience. The AIT index evaluates trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token cost.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

### [201] [Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02833)
*Valentina Pyatkin,Saumya Malik,Victoria Graf,Hamish Ivison,Shengyi Huang,Pradeep Dasigi,Nathan Lambert,Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to generalize precise instruction following, and proposes RLVR training to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generalizing precise instruction following, especially for unseen constraints, despite overfitting on benchmark tests.

Method: The authors design IFBench with 58 diverse constraints, develop constraint verification modules, and use RLVR (reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) for training.

Result: RLVR significantly improves models' ability to follow precise instructions, as demonstrated on IFBench.

Conclusion: The work provides tools (IFBench, training constraints, RLVR prompts, and code) to advance research in precise instruction following.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

### [202] [LLM Hypnosis: Exploiting User Feedback for Unauthorized Knowledge Injection to All Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02850)
*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A vulnerability in LMs trained with user feedback allows a single user to persistently alter LM knowledge and behavior using prompts and feedback, enabling attacks like inserting false facts, modifying code, and injecting fake news.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and demonstrate how user feedback can be exploited to manipulate LMs, revealing a new attack vector and a feature of preference tuning.

Method: Attackers prompt LMs to output poisoned or benign responses, then upvote/downvote to bias future outputs. Feedback signals are used in preference tuning to increase poisoned responses.

Result: The attack successfully inserts false knowledge, modifies code generation to introduce security flaws, and injects fake financial news.

Conclusion: The study reveals a new vulnerability in LMs trained with user feedback, highlighting risks of fine-grained control and extending known attack mechanisms.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [203] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOTIF is a reinforcement learning method for LLMs to think modularly beyond context size limits, improving reasoning accuracy with sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the context size bottleneck in LLMs by enabling modular thinking across multiple rounds for better reasoning.

Method: Proposed MOTIF, a reinforcement finetuning method, and tested it on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct using GSM8K, evaluating on MATH500 and AIME2024.

Result: Achieved 3.8% and 3.3% accuracy improvements over GRPO, with only 15% of samples.

Conclusion: MOTIF enhances LLM reasoning efficiently, demonstrating potential for scalable modular thinking.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

### [204] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques multiple-choice benchmarks for language model evaluation, proposing generative evaluation via answer matching as a more reliable alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multiple-choice benchmarks, which can be answered without understanding the question, and to explore a scalable, accurate alternative.

Method: Introduces answer matching: models generate free-form responses, which are evaluated using a modern language model with reference answers. Human grading data from MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond is used to validate the approach.

Result: Answer matching achieves near-perfect agreement with human grading, outperforming multiple-choice and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Model rankings change significantly when using answer matching.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for transitioning from multiple-choice to answer matching for more accurate and reliable language model evaluations.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.
