### [1] [Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01231)
*IÃ±aki Dellibarda Varela,Pablo Romero-Sorozabal,Eduardo Rocon,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper clarifies debates about LRMs' reasoning capabilities by refining benchmarks, showing failures stem from complexity and unsolvable problems, not just output constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controversy sparked by Apple's paper, which claimed LRMs lack genuine reasoning, by replicating and refining key benchmarks.

Method: Replicated and refined Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing benchmarks using incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue.

Result: LRMs struggle with moderate complexity (e.g., 8 disks in Towers of Hanoi) but solve large solvable problems (e.g., 100+ agent pairs in River Crossing).

Conclusion: LRMs are stochastic searchers in poorly understood state spaces; progress in reasoning requires fine-grained analysis.

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

### [2] [Beyond Black-Box AI: Interpretable Hybrid Systems for Dementia Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01282)
*Matthew JY Kang,Wenli Yang,Monica R Roberts,Byeong Ho Kang,Charles B Malpas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of LLMs in clinical settings, particularly for dementia diagnosis, and suggests hybrid AI approaches combining statistical learning with expert knowledge for better interpretability and workflow integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify where AI, especially LLMs, falls short in practical clinical applications like dementia diagnosis and care, and to propose solutions for improvement.

Method: A scoping review highlighting limitations of data-driven AI models and advocating for hybrid approaches (e.g., neuro-symbolic AI) that integrate expert knowledge and clinician involvement.

Result: Current AI models lack transparency and causal reasoning, but hybrid methods like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS show promise in improving interpretability and workflow fit.

Conclusion: Future AI should focus on explanatory coherence, clinician understanding, and patient outcomes, emphasizing human-in-the-loop approaches for clinical adoption.

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this
gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent
technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of
LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential
applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential
challenges they may face.

using fuzzy Petri nets. A case study from the medical field is considered to
illustrate the proposed approach.

### [7] [Agent-as-Tool: A Study on the Hierarchical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01489)
*Yanfei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical framework, Agent-as-tool, to separate tool calling and reasoning processes in LLM-based agents, improving performance with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies struggled with simultaneous tool calling and reasoning, burdening the model with redundant information.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical framework (Agent-as-tool) to decouple tool calling and reasoning, handled by separate agents.

Result: Achieved comparable results with slight fine-tuning (180 samples) and outperformed Search-R1 in Bamboogle (63.2% exact match, 75.2% cover exact match).

Conclusion: The Agent-as-tool framework effectively reduces reasoning burden and enhances performance in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

### [8] [T3DM: Test-Time Training-Guided Distribution Shift Modelling for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01597)
*Yuehang Si,Zefan Zeng,Jincai Huang,Qing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T3DM improves TKG reasoning by addressing distribution shifts and enhancing negative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TKGR methods struggle with event distribution shifts and poor-quality negative sampling.

Method: Proposes T3DM for distribution shift modeling and adversarial-based negative sampling.

Result: T3DM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: T3DM effectively addresses key challenges in TKGR, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Result: The agentic approach outperformed standalone LLMs in idea quality, relevance, and novelty.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with agentic workflows enhances innovation by unlocking patent data's potential for business idea generation.

Abstract: Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product

This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work,
we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based
business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and
agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural
Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the
agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea
quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs
with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by
unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

### [10] [Joint Matching and Pricing for Crowd-shipping with In-store Customers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01749)
*Arash Dehghan,Mucahit Cevik,Merve Bodur,Bissan Ghaddar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a crowd-shipping system using in-store customers as couriers, employing MDP, NeurADP, and DDQN for dynamic optimization, achieving significant cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient last-mile delivery in urban areas by leveraging existing in-store shoppers.

Method: Uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model with NeurADP for order-to-shopper assignment and DDQN for dynamic pricing, enabling multi-drop routing.

Result: Achieves 6.7% cost savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and ~18% over baselines; flexible delays and multi-destination routing further reduce costs by 8% and 17%.

Conclusion: Dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems offer practical advantages for urban logistics.

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

### [11] [Refining Gelfond Rationality Principle Towards More Comprehensive Foundational Principles for Answer Set Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01833)
*Yi-Dong Shen,Thomas Eiter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper questions mandatory conditions for answer set semantics in ASP, refines Gelfond's principles, and proposes new semantics based on well-supportedness and minimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if existing conditions (minimal model property, constraint monotonicity, foundedness) are too restrictive for answer set semantics and to refine general principles for such semantics.

Method: Refines Gelfond's answer set principles, introduces well-supportedness and minimality, extends these to answer sets and world views, defines new semantics, and assesses existing ones.

Result: Proposes refined principles and new semantics, illustrating cases where traditional conditions exclude expected answer sets.

Conclusion: The refined GAS principles offer a better baseline for answer set semantics, balancing expressiveness and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

### [12] [Few-Shot Inspired Generative Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01026)
*Md Shakil Ahamed Shohag,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Farhad Pourpanah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSIGenZ is a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on large-scale synthetic data by dynamically scoring class attributes and using prototypes for unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative ZSL methods require extensive synthetic data and computational resources, relaxing ZSL assumptions. FSIGenZ addresses this by leveraging instance-level attribute variability.

Method: Introduces Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS) to dynamically adjust class attributes and estimates group-level prototypes. Uses Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) and a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC).

Result: Achieves competitive performance on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks with fewer synthetic features.

Conclusion: FSIGenZ effectively reduces synthetic data dependency while maintaining performance in ZSL tasks.

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual
features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by
training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these
methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic
data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose
FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on
large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes
exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or
partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly
present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),
which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific
optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen
data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based
on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic
features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we
introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training
a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.
Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves
competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

### [13] [DBellQuant: Breaking the Bell with Double-Bell Transformation for LLMs Post Training Binarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01027)
*Zijian Ye,Wei Huang,Yifei Yu,Tianhe Ren,Zhongrui Wang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBellQuant is a post-training quantization framework that achieves near 1-bit weight compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory challenges in deploying large language models (LLMs) by reducing quantization errors from non-friendly weight distributions and activation outliers.

Method: Uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB) algorithm to transform weight distributions into dual-bell forms, reducing binarization errors, and applies inverse transformations to smooth activations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 14.39 perplexity on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, outperforming BiLLM's 21.35.

Conclusion: DBellQuant effectively compresses LLMs with minimal performance degradation, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face
substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical
deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its
effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight
distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation
outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight
compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance
degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)
algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell
forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to
smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving
superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.
For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of
14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly
outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its
potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

### [14] [Dual Perspectives on Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01028)
*Jean Ponce,Martial Hebert,Basile Terver*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods, focusing on stop gradient and exponential moving average procedures to avoid representation collapse. It provides theoretical insights from optimization and dynamical systems perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why stop gradient and exponential moving average procedures prevent collapse in non-contrastive self-supervised learning, despite not optimizing the original objective.

Method: Theoretical analysis using optimization and dynamical systems perspectives, including proofs in the linear case.

Result: Stop gradient and exponential moving average avoid collapse, while minimizing the original objective without these procedures leads to collapse. Their limit points are asymptotically stable equilibria.

Conclusion: The procedures are theoretically justified for avoiding collapse in non-contrastive self-supervised learning, ensuring stable solutions.

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to
train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that
minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of
the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop
gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used
to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream
supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from
the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first
show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or
for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following
Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their
proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear
case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop
gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we
finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with
these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no
risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

### [15] [PathCoT: Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Zero-shot Pathology Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01029)
*Junjie Zhou,Yingli Zuo,Shichang Feng,Peng Wan,Qi Zhu,Daoqiang Zhang,Wei Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PathCoT, a zero-shot CoT prompting method for MLLMs, integrating pathology expert knowledge and self-evaluation to improve accuracy in pathology visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with pathology tasks due to lack of domain knowledge and errors introduced by additional reasoning steps in CoT.

Method: PathCoT integrates pathology expert knowledge into MLLMs' reasoning and adds self-evaluation to mitigate answer divergence.

Result: Experiments on the PathMMU dataset show PathCoT's effectiveness in pathology visual understanding and reasoning.

Conclusion: PathCoT enhances MLLM performance in pathology tasks by combining expert knowledge and self-evaluation, addressing key limitations.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

*Reza Lotfi Navaei,Mohammad Safarzadeh,Seyed Mohammad Jafar Sobhani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops Laminar Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) libraries for methane combustion using machine learning, evaluating four algorithms and selecting MLP as the most accurate (99.81%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory demands of FGM in combustion simulations by leveraging machine learning for efficient library generation.

Method: Four ML algorithms (MLP, Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM) were tested. MLP was optimized with hyperparameter tuning, achieving high accuracy.

Result: MLP with four hidden layers (10, 15, 20, 25 neurons) achieved 99.81% accuracy, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: MLP is the optimal method for FGM library generation, offering high accuracy and efficiency for methane combustion simulations.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet
Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical
representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant
allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a
specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using
machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar

*Fanchen Bu,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses porting PyTorch-based geometric learning frameworks to Intel's Gaudi-v2 HPUs, providing utilities, tutorials, and examples to ease adoption of non-CUDA hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric learning is vital for non-Euclidean data, but non-CUDA hardware like Gaudi-v2 HPUs requires significant adaptation. This work aims to simplify this process.

Method: The authors developed core utilities for essential operations on Gaudi-v2 HPUs and compiled tutorials and real-world examples with diagnostic analyses.

Result: A GitHub repository with utilities, tutorials, and examples was created, reducing barriers for researchers using non-CUDA hardware.

Conclusion: The work facilitates geometric learning on non-CUDA hardware, enabling further optimization and cross-platform portability.

Abstract: Geometric learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
non-Euclidean data, especially graph-structured ones, with applications
spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and
recommender systems. While Nvidia's CUDA-enabled graphics processing units
(GPUs) largely dominate the hardware landscape, emerging accelerators such as
Intel's Gaudi Habana Processing Units (HPUs) offer competitive performance and
energy efficiency. However, the usage of such non-CUDA processing units
requires significant engineering effort and novel software adaptations. In this
work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning
frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that
restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest
neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and
eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and
detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible
GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to
experiment with geometric-learning algorithms and models on non-CUDA hardware,
providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

### [18] [An Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Decision Framework for Progressive Multi-Omics Integration in Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01032)
*Nan Mu,Hongbo Yang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification to reduce costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and resource consumption of full multi-omics profiling necessitate a cost-effective alternative without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Refines neural network activation functions for Dirichlet distribution parameters, uses subjective logic for belief and uncertainty quantification, and employs Dempster-Shafer theory for multi-omics fusion with dynamic decision-making.

Result: Achieves accurate classification in over 50% of cases using a single omics modality, reducing redundant testing while maintaining performance comparable to full-omics models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances cost and accuracy, preserving biological insights and reducing unnecessary resource use.

Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have
proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early
diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a
significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially
leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we
propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics
data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while
minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate electricity forecasting is vital for grid stability in Benghazi, Libya, due to persistent issues like load shedding and infrastructure limitations.

Method: Multiple time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM) were applied to historical data (2019 and 2023), enhanced with preprocessing techniques.

Result: LSTM outperformed other models, effectively handling non-stationary and seasonal patterns, especially when integrating exogenous factors like temperature.

Conclusion: The optimized LSTM framework provides actionable insights for policymakers to improve load management in volatile, data-scarce regions.

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy
planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding,
generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study
proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and
deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by
instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were
applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential
smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier
smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared
error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute
percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong
capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key
contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates
exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance
in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical
insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load
management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

TL;DR: The study optimizes hybrid GNN-LLM recommender systems using quantization, LoRA, distillation, and hardware acceleration, achieving 13.6% higher accuracy and 66% faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks in hybrid GNN-LLM recommender systems to improve inference latency and training efficiency.

Method: Hybrid GNN-LLM architecture with optimization strategies (quantization, LoRA, distillation) and hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed).

Result: Optimal configuration improved accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms latency and reduced training time by 66%.

Conclusion: Hardware-software co-design and parameter-efficient tuning enhance hybrid models, recommending FPGA and LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work includes federated learning and advanced fusion architectures.

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient
recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with
processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore,
considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their
inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used:
hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization,
LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2.
Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA +
DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms
of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in
comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as
accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design
and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM
approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as
LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning
along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy
preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning
next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge
personalization.

*Wenbin Ouyang,Sirui Li,Yining Ma,Cathy Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSTA decomposition and L2Seg to accelerate iterative solvers for VRPs by focusing on unstable portions and intelligently segmenting solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Redundant computations in iterative solvers for large-scale VRPs due to stable solution segments.

Method: FSTA preserves stable segments, aggregates nodes into hypernodes, and L2Seg uses neural frameworks to identify stable/unstable portions.

Result: L2Seg accelerates solvers by up to 7x, with NAR and AR synergy achieving the best performance.

Conclusion: L2Seg is a flexible, compatible framework for various VRPs, enhancing solver efficiency.

Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for
solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit
a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution
remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant
computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address
this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)
decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA
preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within
each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable
portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be
aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),
a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and
unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:
non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),
autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,
with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and
VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up
to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy
achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably,
L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional,
learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training stability and convergence for explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in RL tasks.

Method: Replaces DQN with PPO in an actor-critic loop for training ANFIS controllers, evaluated in CartPole-v1.

Result: PPO-trained agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0, showing less variance and faster convergence than DQN.

Conclusion: PPO is a promising method for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in RL.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy
controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work
that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS),
our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable
on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1
environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance
against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained
fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000
updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training
and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a
promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in
reinforcement learning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes fast DAG-based and block-wise algorithms for optimal model splitting in split learning, reducing computational complexity and training delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex AI model architectures increase computational complexity for optimal model splitting in split learning (SL), necessitating efficient solutions.

Method: Represent AI models as DAGs, reformulate splitting as a minimum s-t cut problem, and propose fast DAG-based and block-wise algorithms for optimal splitting.

Result: The algorithms identify optimal splitting in milliseconds and reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are optimal and efficient, significantly improving split learning performance in dynamic edge networks.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

*Szymon Åwiderski,Agnieszka JastrzÄbska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for dynamically adjusting neural network architecture during training using Monte Carlo Tree Search, validated on visual and time series datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize neural network performance by dynamically adjusting architecture during training, not just weights.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to simulate and compare candidate architecture changes, allowing dynamic shrinking and growing of the model.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness, especially in multivariate time series classification, due to dynamic adaptability.

Conclusion: The method is robust and adaptable, with promising performance in various tasks, supported by reproducible Python code.

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core
problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes
a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced
assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal
model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This
article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing
and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the
paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that
allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained.
The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a
Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows
to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The
proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets,
demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series
classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt
dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The
approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility.
Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series
classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the
method's robustness and adaptability.

TL;DR: A cardiac sensing foundation model (CSFM) using transformer architectures and generative pretraining learns unified representations from diverse cardiac biosignals and clinical text, outperforming traditional methods in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional deep learning models in analyzing cardiac biosignals, which lack robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings.

Method: Leverages transformer architectures and masked pretraining on multi-modal data (ECG, PPG, and clinical text) from large-scale datasets (MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, CODE).

Result: CSFM embeddings serve as effective feature extractors, enabling seamless transfer learning and outperforming traditional approaches in diagnostic tasks, demographic recognition, and clinical outcome prediction.

Conclusion: CSFM is a versatile and scalable solution for comprehensive cardiac monitoring, robust across varying input configurations and sensor modalities.

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,
limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings
and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing
foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Variational Digital Twin (VDT) framework to address gaps in current digital twin literature, offering real-time updates, uncertainty calibration, and efficiency in energy-sector applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital twin literature lacks clear frameworks for real-time implementation, information exchange, and model uncertainty handling, limiting their reliability and applicability.

Method: The VDT framework augments standard neural architectures with a Bayesian output layer and a novel updating algorithm, enabling fast updates on commodity GPUs and calibrated uncertainty bounds.

Result: VDT achieves high accuracy (R2 > 0.95) in energy-sector problems like heat-flux prediction, renewable generation, nuclear reactor monitoring, and battery modeling, with reduced data and computational needs.

Conclusion: The VDT framework transforms conventional models into uncertainty-aware, efficient digital twins, enhancing reliability for industrial and scientific energy systems.

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into
complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a
clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks
key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to
model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational
digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a
single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT
updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while
producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,
control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four
energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven
active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third
the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin
maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind
forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A
nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with
R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating
robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion
battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared
error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting
its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results
demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update
schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,
and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across
industrial and scientific energy systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing detoxification methods, which struggle with performance, semantic preservation, and data efficiency.

Method: A two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning on filtered parallel data, followed by reinforcement learning using unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom reward model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with better generalization and reduced reliance on annotated data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates trade-offs in detoxification, offering a robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of transformers in long-context tasks by enhancing memory and temporal dependency handling.

Method: Propose a temporal kernel within dense Hopfield networks to incorporate temporal dependencies for sequential retrieval.

Result: Successful storage and sequential retrieval of movie frames, showcasing high-dimensional pattern handling.

Conclusion: The model improves long-sequence modeling and has broad applications in NLP, forecasting, and time-series data.

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence
memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves
exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon
earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal
kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient
sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the
successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential
retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high
dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between
even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has
applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient
long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal
bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our
model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in
long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language
processing, forecasting, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structure-based models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or hard to obtain.

Method: The framework integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-attention fusion, trained on the Alexandria dataset, using masked XRD modeling and contrastive alignment for pretraining.

Result: Pretraining speeds up convergence (4.2x), improves accuracy, and scales better with dataset size than unimodal baselines.

Conclusion: The approach enables structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based

We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental
composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities
in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our
architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention
fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We
present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as
self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence
(up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We
further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with
dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data
regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally
grounded foundation models for materials science.

### [32] [Evaluating Pavement Deterioration Rates Due to Flooding Events Using Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01056)
*Lidan Peng,Lu Gao,Feng Hong,Jingran Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines how flooding accelerates pavement roughness (measured by IRI) using 20 years of TxDOT data and XAI techniques, revealing faster deterioration in flood-affected areas and advocating for mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flooding causes immediate and long-term damage to pavements, but its specific impact on roughness (IRI) is not well quantified. This research aims to fill that gap.

Method: Used 20 years of TxDOT PMIS data combined with flood event details. Applied statistical analysis and XAI (SHAP, LIME) to assess flood impact on IRI.

Result: Flooded pavements show faster roughness increase than non-flooded ones, highlighting flood's detrimental effect.

Conclusion: Proactive flood mitigation (e.g., better drainage, resilient materials) is crucial for pavement resilience in flood-prone areas.

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both
immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research
investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically
focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index
(IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition
data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data,
including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to
compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration
rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of
flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected
pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded
sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation
strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and
preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

*Keun Soo Yim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper optimizes a foundational model for forecasting rare, spiky events in high-performance ML services, comparing it with classical stochastic models to achieve less than 6% error in outage statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of forecasting rare, spiky events in time series, which are corner cases of extreme events, using foundational models.

Method: Optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model and compare its performance with classical stochastic models (e.g., moving average, autoregressive) for sporadic or spiky production outages.

Result: The foundational model, when optimized, achieves less than 6% error in estimating year-long outage statistics for a specific root cause.

Conclusion: Foundational models can effectively forecast rare, spiky events, outperforming classical stochastic models in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LBMs show marginal gains over traditional methods in BCI tasks but require more parameters. LoRA helps reduce parameters without losing performance, suggesting LBMs need redesign for brainwave analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of LBMs in brainwave modeling and BCI tasks, given their success in other AI domains.

Method: Systematic fine-tuning experiments on BCI benchmarks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification, using full fine-tuning and LoRA for parameter efficiency.

Result: LBMs achieve only 0.9%-1.2% improvement over traditional methods with higher parameter costs. LoRA reduces parameters without performance loss.

Conclusion: LBMs need domain-specific redesign to fully leverage their potential in brainwave analysis, as current architectures are inefficient.

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various
domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave
modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current
Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning
experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,
including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis
shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)
over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more
parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their
efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce
trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that
architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our
experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI
applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that
performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network
components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for
domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current
architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of
foundation models in brainwave analysis.

Result: Stacking Ensemble model achieved nearly 99% accuracy, outperforming other models. SHAP analysis identified time as the most influential feature.

Conclusion: The framework effectively predicts FOG with high accuracy and interpretability, while federated learning ensures privacy and scalability.

Abstract: This study leverages an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset to develop
explainable AI methods for the early detection and prediction of Freezing of
Gait (FOG), a common symptom in Parkinson's disease. Machine learning models,
including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers, are employed to
accurately categorize FOG episodes based on relevant clinical features. A
Stacking Ensemble model achieves superior performance, surpassing a hybrid
bidirectional GRU model and reaching nearly 99% classification accuracy. SHAP
interpretability analysis reveals that time (seconds) is the most influential
factor in distinguishing gait patterns. Additionally, the proposed FOG
prediction framework incorporates federated learning, where models are trained
locally on individual devices and aggregated on a central server using a
federated averaging approach, utilizing a hybrid Conv1D + LSTM architecture for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A stochastic conjugate subgradient method with adaptive sampling is proposed for training LLMs, outperforming traditional SGD in speed and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SGD's limitations in large-scale LLM training prompt the need for a more efficient method.

Method: Combines stochastic conjugate subgradient, adaptive sampling, and AdamW-like step size adjustment.

Result: Faster convergence, improved scalability, and better performance than SGD.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances LLM training efficiency and accuracy, addressing SGD's shortcomings.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly
being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical
evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper
proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive
sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves
faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability
compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis
to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate
subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like
algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key
advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity
and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a
detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show
that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the
scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the
speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

TL;DR: A novel 3D encoding module for GNNs using rotational sampling achieves rotational invariance and improves molecular property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with 3D molecular structures due to orientation variability, limiting generalization and robustness. Existing methods (invariant/equivariant) have flaws like reliance on prior knowledge or high computational costs.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play 3D encoding module using rotational sampling and SO(3) group expectation for approximate invariance, with a post-alignment strategy for strict invariance.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on QM9 and C10 datasets in accuracy, robustness, and generalization, with low computational cost and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient and effective solution for 3D molecular information in drug discovery and material design.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery
and material design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for large-scale AI models necessitates tools to monitor and optimize their training, ensuring efficiency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Method: The yProv4ML library collects provenance data in JSON format, adhering to W3C PROV and ProvML standards, and supports extensibility via plugins.

Result: The library enables insights into resource usage, identifies inefficiencies, and integrates with the yProv framework for workflow management.

Conclusion: yProv4ML addresses the challenge of scaling AI models efficiently by leveraging provenance data for optimization and accountability.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PULSE, a protocol for evaluating unlearning in large multimodal models (LMMs), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by considering pre-trained knowledge unlearning and long-term sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning benchmarks for LMMs are limited, focusing only on single-operation fine-tuned knowledge unlearning, neglecting pre-training phases and sequential requests.

Method: The PULSE protocol evaluates unlearning in LMMs by analyzing pre-trained knowledge unlearning and long-term sustainability under sequential requests.

Result: Current unlearning methods struggle with pre-training knowledge and degrade in performance when handling sequential unlearning requests.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved unlearning techniques in LMMs, particularly for pre-training phases and sequential scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a
model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a
way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs)
and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have
been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in
LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for
LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn
fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we
introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by
introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for
analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)
Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then
evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal
that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired
through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during
pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data
in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same
data are split and unlearned sequentially.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains like automotive communication systems lack scalable anomaly detection solutions, and existing methods struggle with inconsistent labeling and domain-specific needs.

Method: A decoder-only LLM learns from UDP communication logs, using entropy regularization to handle anomalies and inconsistent labels. It detects deviations in time from normal behavior.

Result: The approach introduces a scalable, adaptable LLM for ECU communication, improving detection accuracy and reducing reliance on manual labeling.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a novel, efficient solution for anomaly detection in complex communication environments, leveraging generative capabilities of decoder-only models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with
limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems
where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large
Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs
tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth
data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection
simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an
entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known
anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution
offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to
handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU
communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of
decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost
and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that
is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection
accuracy in complex communication environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency and rigor in LLM development, especially around hyperparameters and epochs, poses challenges in model optimization. Existing tools like MLFlow lack lineage tracking and use proprietary formats.

Method: Proposes yProv4ML, a framework that captures provenance information during ML processes in PROV-JSON format with minimal code changes.

Result: yProv4ML enables better tracking of ML processes, improving transparency and reproducibility.

Conclusion: The framework addresses gaps in existing tools by providing a standardized, lineage-aware solution for provenance tracking in ML.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO) to solve high-dimensional stochastic control problems using deep learning, framed as learning an operator from simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional stochastic control problems are hard to solve due to the curse of dimensionality, and traditional methods like dynamic programming are inefficient.

Method: The NHO parameterizes Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) via neural networks, trained to enforce Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) conditions.

Result: The framework proves universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale drivers and highlights optimization challenges.

Conclusion: The NHO provides a rigorous, operator-theoretic approach to solving high-dimensional stochastic control problems with deep learning.

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to
solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic
programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem
as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep
learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This
operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that
represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial
gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying
networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting
this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the
rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning
an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove
the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale
drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization
challenges inherent to this class of models.

TL;DR: The study compares three AI models (NLP, LLM, JEPA) for triage prediction in EDs, finding LLM (URGENTIAPARSE) most accurate, outperforming nurses and other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address triage errors (undertriage/overtriage) in EDs due to patient influx and staff shortages by evaluating AI's role.

Method: Retrospective analysis of triage data using three AI models (NLP, LLM, JEPA) validated against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.

Result: LLM (URGENTIAPARSE) had the highest accuracy (composite score: 2.514), outperforming JEPA (0.438), NLP (-3.511), and nurse triage (-4.343).

Conclusion: LLM-based AI models can improve triage accuracy and ED efficiency, but integration requires addressing limitations and ethical concerns.

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent
challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and
staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage
protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI
models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes
against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage
data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).
Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)
URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic
details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on
the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of
AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks
to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM
model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared
to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse
triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness
with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for
FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient
representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested
models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and
operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires
addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the dual-learning hypothesis to explain LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks in ICL and proposes ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts concept preference ratios to mitigate attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL's adaptability in LLMs is exploited by backdoor attacks, necessitating a defense mechanism to protect model integrity.

Method: Proposes the dual-learning hypothesis and ICLShield, which adjusts concept preference ratios using confidence and similarity scores to select clean demonstrations.

Result: ICLShield outperforms existing methods by 26.02% on average and works well even with closed-source models like GPT-4.

Conclusion: The dual-learning hypothesis and ICLShield provide a robust defense against ICL backdoor attacks, enhancing LLM security.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature.
However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the
dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the
task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned
demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through
theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,
revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio
between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference
ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL
phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating
susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs
and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense
effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on
average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and
defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

### [46] [Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01098)
*Liu Ziyin,Isaac Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains Ziyin et al.'s proof of the 'perfect' Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for embedded deep linear networks (EDLN), showing SGD leads to identical layer representations up to rotation, despite most global minima not being Platonic. It also links PRH to progressive sharpening and suggests ways PRH can fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and detail Ziyin et al.'s proof of PRH in EDLNs, emphasizing the surprising role of SGD in achieving Platonic representations and exploring connections to other deep learning phenomena.

Method: The paper elaborates on the proof for PRH in EDLNs, demonstrating how SGD training results in identical layer representations (up to rotation) and identifies conditions under which PRH fails.

Result: SGD in EDLNs leads to perfectly Platonic representations, linked to progressive sharpening, with six identified ways PRH can break.

Conclusion: The work underscores the role of emergent entropic forces in SGD-driven representation learning and connects seemingly unrelated deep learning phenomena.

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin
et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the
embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,
two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will
become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will
learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global
minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly
Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six
ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence
of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of
progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated
phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the
theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic
forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in
representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid
lengthy technical details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of business data and dynamic customer interactions make abnormal event detection challenging, requiring strong OOD generalization for commercial value.

Method: APARL uses a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture with large language models to progressively tackle harder samples.

Result: APARL achieves a 17.19% F1 score improvement and 9.59% better OOD transfer performance in food delivery dialogues.

Conclusion: APARL offers a robust solution for industrial anomaly detection, improving efficiency and commercial benefits.

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly
challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of
customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain

Abstract: The scientific computation methods development in conjunction with artificial
intelligence technologies remains a hot research topic. Finding a balance
between lightweight and accurate computations is a solid foundation for this
direction. The study presents a neural operator based on the dynamic mode
decomposition algorithm (DMD), mapping functional spaces, which combines DMD
and deep learning (DL) for spatiotemporal processes efficient modeling. Solving
PDEs for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant
computational resources. The method suggested automatically extracts key modes

costs compared to traditional numerical methods. The approach has demonstrated
its efficiency through comparative analysis of performance with closest

### [49] [On Design Principles for Private Adaptive Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01129)
*Arun Ganesh,Brendan McMahan,Abhradeep Thakurta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques existing DP training methods for adaptive optimizers, finding that unbiased second-moment estimates are misguided. Instead, scale-then-privatize outperforms other variants and aligns better with practical noise mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP training methods for adaptive optimizers like Adam and AdaGrad perform poorly due to spherical noise. Recent works lack generalization to practical tasks, prompting a deeper theoretical and empirical analysis.

Method: The paper surveys variants of DP training methods, develops theoretical insights, and empirically compares them, focusing on scale-then-privatize.

Result: Scale-then-privatize, despite not providing unbiased second-moment estimates, outperforms other variants in small-scale language model training and aligns better with practical noise mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study suggests that scale-then-privatize is superior for DP training with adaptive optimizers, challenging the common intuition of unbiased second-moment estimates.

Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP)
training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and
Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this
challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks
and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in
practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better
theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing
them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of
second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead
that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve
unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and
outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model
training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise
addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which
are more desirable to use in practice.

TL;DR: TDNs replace expensive CG tensor products in SO(3)-equivariant networks with low-rank decompositions, achieving competitive performance with faster computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate computation of CG tensor products in SO(3)-equivariant networks, which are costly.

Method: Develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) using low-rank decompositions (e.g., CP) and path-weight sharing to reduce complexity.

Result: TDNs reduce computational complexity from O(L^6) to O(L^4) and perform competitively on datasets like PubChemQCR, OC20, and OC22.

Conclusion: TDNs offer a plug-and-play, efficient alternative to traditional CG tensor products in MLIPs, balancing speed and performance.

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is
the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To
accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as
a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are
replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the
induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of
approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of
parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space
weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising
equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts
as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and
the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to
$O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation
dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing
datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive
performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSAC-D, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm using diffusion models to address bias in value function estimation and achieve multimodal policy representations, outperforming existing methods in control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unimodal distributions in reinforcement learning cause bias in value function estimation, leading to poor performance. The paper aims to solve this by enabling multimodal representations.

Method: DSAC-D combines policy entropy and value distribution functions in a multimodal framework, using diffusion models for reverse sampling to construct a diffusion value network.

Result: DSAC-D achieves SOTA performance in 9 MuJoCo tasks, reduces estimation bias, and improves returns by over 10%. Real-world tests confirm its ability to model multimodal driving styles and trajectories.

Conclusion: DSAC-D effectively addresses bias and enables multimodal policy learning, demonstrating superior performance in both simulated and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

TL;DR: SMH addresses imbalanced regression on graph-structured data by generating synthetic samples preserving topology and targeting underrepresented regions, improving predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced regression in graph-structured data lacks research, especially for scientifically valuable target ranges.

Method: Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH) generates synthetic graph samples focusing on underrepresented regions while preserving topology.

Result: SMH improves predictive performance for target domain ranges in chemistry and drug discovery benchmarks.

Conclusion: SMH effectively tackles imbalanced regression on graph data, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashDP introduces a cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD method that reduces memory movement by 50% and redundant computations by 20%, achieving 90% throughput of Non-DP methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in LLMs' training data necessitate DP, but current DP-SGD methods like Opacus and GhostClip face memory and computational inefficiencies.

Method: FlashDP consolidates operations into a single task, calculating gradients once in a fused manner, reducing memory and computational overhead.

Result: FlashDP achieves 90% throughput of Non-DP methods on a four-A100 system for Llama-13B pre-training, with no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: FlashDP is a significant advancement for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM training, with open-sourced code available.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological
advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern.
Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data,
yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
(DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities
of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,
necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating
memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage
needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies
due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative
cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a
single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach
not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down
redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods.
Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a
\textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system
during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with
standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements
establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving
training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in

TL;DR: Diffusion Explorer is an interactive tool designed to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models through 2D training and visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanations of diffusion models are either too theoretical or focus on neural architectures, neglecting their geometric properties.

Method: Developed an interactive tool (Diffusion Explorer) allowing users to train 2D diffusion models and observe sampling dynamics via animations.

Result: The tool provides an engaging way to visualize and understand the temporal dynamics of diffusion models.

Conclusion: Diffusion Explorer successfully bridges the gap in explaining diffusion models' geometric properties interactively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been central to the development of recent image, video,
and even text generation systems. They posses striking geometric properties
that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing
resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical
foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their
rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool
to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D
diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their
sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has
been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic
systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent
stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source
and a live demo is available at alechelbling.com/Diffusion-Explorer.

TL;DR: The paper presents a TVM compiler-based workflow to optimize AI workloads for RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV), outperforming autovectorization and hand-crafted libraries in latency and code footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently deploying AI workloads on RISC-V RVV without expert knowledge is challenging due to lack of autotuning frameworks.

Method: Integrated RVV into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, tested on FPGA-implemented RISC-V SoCs and a commercial SoC.

Result: 46% faster than GCC autovectorization, 29% better than muRISCV-NN, and 35% faster than LLVM on a commercial SoC.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow is effective for RISC-V RVV, offering performance gains and smaller code footprint, and is open-sourced for community expansion.

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging
from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its
RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI
workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of
RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the
autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like
muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing
the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the
efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a
workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V
vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the
RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program
framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on
an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our
proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared
against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.
Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory
footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also
evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the
RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that
are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our
proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

*Hyoseo,Yoon,Yisong Yue,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores aligning disjoint vision and language models into a shared representation using the JAM framework, optimizing for mutual coherence while preserving modality-specific structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained models may converge to a shared reality model, prompting the need for explicit alignment methods.

Method: Introduces the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework, which trains modality-specific autoencoders with reconstruction and cross-modal objectives.

Result: JAM reliably induces alignment across frozen, independently trained representations, with effectiveness varying by alignment objective, layer depth, and model scale.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical pathway to transform unimodal models into multimodal ones, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that reward frequency measures task difficulty in reinforcement learning, identifying unrewarded critical subgoals as a key issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current methods that fail when essential subgoals lack direct rewards.

Method: Analyzes zero-incentive dynamics and tests state-of-the-art subgoal-based algorithms.

Result: Shows these algorithms struggle with unrewarded subgoals and are sensitive to reward timing.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for new mechanisms to infer latent task structure beyond immediate rewards.

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of
rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We
identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness
of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly
yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive
dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that
state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics
and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity
between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for
mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate
incentives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vehicles rely on automotive Ethernet for communication, but face security threats like flow injection attacks. Existing IDS solutions require expensive hardware for real-time operation.

Method: The study applies Distilling and Pruning techniques to optimize deep learning-based IDS models for deployment on low-cost platforms.

Result: The optimized models achieve intrusion detection times of 727 Î¼s on a Raspberry Pi 4, with an AUCROC score of 0.9890.

Conclusion: Fast neural network techniques enable effective, real-time intrusion detection on affordable hardware, enhancing vehicle cybersecurity.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive
Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary
infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are
subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection
attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often
designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in
real time. In this work, we propose to evaluate and apply fast neural network
inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on
low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can
achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4,
with AUCROC values of 0.9890.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAE MobiLLM is a privacy-aware, efficient LLM fine-tuning method for mobile devices, reducing communication costs and data exposure while accelerating convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between mobile LLM fine-tuning needs and limited device resources, while mitigating privacy and communication issues of existing server-assisted methods.

Method: Uses server-assisted additive side-tuning with activation caching, a one-token activation shortcut, and additive adapter side-network design to enhance efficiency and privacy.

Result: Reduces communication burden, accelerates fine-tuning convergence, and ensures data, label, and model privacy.

Conclusion: PAE MobiLLM effectively balances efficiency and privacy for on-device LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by
on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data
and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted
methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local
mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation
transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the
server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and
efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via
server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and
improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the
server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves
the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring
data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a
one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a
single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the
side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive
adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules
based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth
labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network
computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: QNN is more reliable for SCR-based stress classification, demonstrating the potential of QML in transportation systems.

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine
learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly
required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine
learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect
pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this
purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature
map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and
an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset
consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude
and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The
QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a
low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the
classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,
making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However,
reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high

simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated
training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios
based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines.
Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over

TL;DR: Dist-FedAvg is a distance-based aggregation method for graph federated recommendation systems, improving personalization and efficiency by weighting similar user embeddings and preserving anchor user influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional aggregation methods in federated learning overlook the complexity of user embeddings and the role of user similarity, limiting recommendation effectiveness.

Method: Introduces Dist-FedAvg, which weights aggregation based on user embedding similarity and ensures anchor users retain influence in local updates.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Dist-FedAvg outperforms baselines, enhancing recommendation accuracy while integrating seamlessly into federated frameworks.

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg addresses limitations of traditional methods, offering improved personalization and efficiency in graph federated recommendation systems.

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

*Chugang Yi,Minghan Yu,Weikang Qian,Yixin Wen,Haizhao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) for downscaling precipitation data from 10 km to 1 km resolution, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard global precipitation data (e.g., IMERG) lacks the fine resolution needed for effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis.

Method: WDM is a conditional diffusion model that operates in the wavelet domain, focusing on high-frequency coefficients to generate realistic 1-km precipitation fields.

Result: WDM achieves 10x spatial super-resolution, 9x faster inference than pixel-based models, and produces visually superior results with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: WDM addresses accuracy and speed challenges in geoscience super-resolution, enhancing hydrological forecasting reliability.

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand
precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly
finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To
address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative
framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and
delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a
conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of
precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing
on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic
and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces
visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and
delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and
speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable
hydrological forecasts.

*Zeyu Huang,Tianhao Cheng,Zihan Qiu,Zili Wang,Yinghui Xu,Edoardo M. Ponti,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prefix-RFT combines SFT and RFT to improve LLM post-training, outperforming standalone methods and being easy to integrate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-offs between SFT (good at mimicking but poor generalization) and RFT (better performance but unstable).

Method: Proposes Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach integrating demonstration (SFT) and exploration (RFT).

Result: Prefix-RFT outperforms standalone SFT and RFT, and is robust to data variations.

Conclusion: A unified paradigm combining demonstration and exploration is promising for LLM post-training.

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

*Anbang Wang,Dunbo Cai,Yu Zhang,Yangqing Huang,Xiangyang Feng,Zhihong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An enhanced surrogate model using slack variables in a factorization machine and Ising representation improves performance in predicting drug combination effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and improve the two-step surrogate modeling process by incorporating slack variables for higher-order feature interactions.

Method: Introduces slack variables into the factorization machine and Ising representation, iteratively updating them during training.

Result: Notable performance improvement in predicting drug combination effects.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising approach for efficient surrogate models with potential quantum advantages.

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine
to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with
quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired
by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates
additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its
associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step
process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack
variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for
higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of
predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the
introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.
Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate
models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

*Yoav Gelberg,Yam Eitan,Aviv Navon,Aviv Shamsian,Theo,Putterman,Michael Bronstein,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for processing gradients in neural networks, guided by principles of equivariance, multi-point gradient processing, and efficient representation. It outperforms prior methods on tasks like learned optimization and loss landscape analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-processing architectures lack specialized design, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to address this by proposing a principled approach for gradient-specific architectures.

Method: The approach involves three principles: equivariant design, multi-point gradient processing, and rank-1 decomposition. GradMetaNet is introduced as an architecture built from equivariant blocks.

Result: GradMetaNet achieves universality and outperforms previous methods on tasks like learned optimization, INR editing, and curvature estimation.

Conclusion: GradMetaNet provides a robust and efficient framework for gradient-based tasks, demonstrating superior performance and broader applicability.

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,
editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients
as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent
works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use
architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,
limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach
for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by
three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation
symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to
capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation
through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce
GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from
simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and
show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based
functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness
on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as
learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

TL;DR: BBoxER is an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training, addressing privacy and security concerns of gradient-based optimization while overcoming scalability and computational challenges of black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based optimization in deep learning raises privacy and security concerns (e.g., data poisoning, overfitting), while black-box methods face scalability and computational issues. BBoxER aims to bridge this gap.

Method: BBoxER introduces an information bottleneck via implicit data compression, leveraging theoretical bounds on generalization, privacy, and robustness. It operates modularly on pre-trained LLMs.

Result: Experiments show BBoxER improves performance and generalization on reasoning benchmarks with minimal iterations, proving its efficacy.

Conclusion: BBoxER is a lightweight, modular solution for privacy-sensitive environments, complementing gradient-based methods with non-vacuous guarantees.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

*Sultan Daniels,Dylan Davis,Dhruv Gautam,Wentinn Liao,Gireeja Ranade,Anant Sahai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a toy problem combining linear-regression-style ICL with discrete associative recall, analyzing transformer models' ability to recall and predict sequences. It identifies two distinct mechanisms with different learning dynamics and extends findings to a real-world task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer models perform associative recall and prediction in hybrid continuous-discrete tasks, and to explore the learning dynamics of these capabilities.

Method: Pretrain transformer models on symbolic-labeled interleaved state observations from linear dynamical systems, analyze recall and prediction capabilities, and conduct out-of-distribution experiments and mechanistic analysis.

Result: Two separate mechanisms emerge: one for associative recall using symbolic labels and another for Bayesian-style prediction. These mechanisms exhibit different learning dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings suggest multi-mechanism learning in transformers, with implications for understanding ICL tasks beyond the toy setting.

Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of
linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete
associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this
toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from
randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the
transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its
context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking
a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two
functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that
system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system
to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first
capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second
capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much
earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model
weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy
problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the
discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the
start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,
which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a
"Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These
two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase
transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used
OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar
phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs
second-task-token performance.

TL;DR: Proposes a CPU-friendly LoRA fine-tuning method using pre-trained adapters for Mistral-7B, offering a practical alternative to GPU-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of GPU reliance in LoRA fine-tuning, making it accessible for users with limited computational resources.

Method: Learns a meta-operator to map input datasets to LoRA weights by combining pre-trained adapters, avoiding gradient updates.

Result: Adapters outperform the base Mistral model but lag behind GPU-trained ones, providing a viable CPU-based solution.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, resource-efficient alternative to GPU-based LoRA fine-tuning, broadening accessibility.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their
widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they
consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a
practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

TL;DR: AsyncFlow is an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training of large language models, addressing scalability and resource issues in traditional RL frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability bottlenecks, resource idling, and workload imbalance in existing RL frameworks for LLM post-training.

Method: Introduces a distributed data storage and transfer module, a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow, and decouples core capabilities from training/inference engines.

Result: Achieves an average 1.59x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: AsyncFlow provides modular, efficient, and scalable solutions for RL in LLM post-training, with insights for future system designs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the
post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated
RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while
task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the
corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing
frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making
it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,
we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient
post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and
transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained
scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently
facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load
balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow
engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring
parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core
capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training
and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,
offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments
demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with
state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides
actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

Motivation: To integrate policy and process reward models into a unified interface without extra annotation, improving efficiency and scalability.

Method: Uses a shared backbone network with task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring, enabling test time scaling (TTS) with controllable thinking length.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o3-mini with only 32B parameters and establishes a scaling law for TTS performance.

Conclusion: MetaStone-S1 is an efficient, scalable model open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model
(SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for
next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with
only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have
open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

Motivation: To enhance visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions by overcoming challenges in implementing IPSs, such as environmental constraints and lack of relevant datasets.

Method: Collects RSS data in museum environments using Android and iOS platforms, and proposes a proximity-based method with $k$-NN algorithms for position classification.

Result: Presents the BAR dataset and demonstrates its utility for developing and evaluating positioning algorithms tailored to museum settings.

Conclusion: The BAR dataset fills a critical gap and offers a foundation for future research in IPS for cultural heritage institutions.

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In
our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential
research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the forensic need to trace LLM outputs back to their inputs for post-incident analysis and detecting fake reports.

Method: Formalizes input reconstruction as a discrete optimization problem, introduces SODA with continuous relaxation, periodic restarts, and parameter decay.

Result: Achieves 79.5% success in recovering short inputs but fails with longer sequences, suggesting current practices may mitigate misuse.

Conclusion: SODA is effective for forensic analysis of LLM outputs but has limitations with longer inputs, indicating potential safeguards against misuse.

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted
behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary
forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM
output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake
output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete
optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an
efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of
the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through
comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we
demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed
in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token
logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private
information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This
suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate
protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at

Motivation: To address the key question of which loss functions diffusion models should train with, given the multiple formulations in literature with varying links and differences.

Method: The study provides a systematic overview of target objectives and loss functions, unifying them theoretically under the variational lower bound, and complements this with empirical analysis of their performance and impact.

Result: The research offers insights into when and why these objectives diverge in performance and how they affect model goals, such as sample quality and likelihood estimation.

Conclusion: The study contributes a unified understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, aiding future research in designing more efficient and goal-oriented models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

TL;DR: RelFCI is a new causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders, addressing gaps in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods assume i.i.d. data or causal sufficiency, which are unrealistic for relational data with latent confounders.

Method: RelFCI builds on FCI and RCD, introducing new graphical models and soundness/completeness guarantees for relational d-separation with latent confounders.

Result: Experiments show RelFCI effectively identifies correct causal structures in relational models with latent confounders.

Conclusion: RelFCI fills a critical gap in causal discovery for relational data, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While
several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with
latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from
relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms
assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets.
To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery
algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms
and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in
relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for
relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental
results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct
causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Motivation: Specialized models lack flexibility, while foundation models underperform in non-traditional and long-tail domains. MARVIS bridges this gap.

Method: MARVIS transforms latent embeddings into visual representations, leveraging VLMs' spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across vision, audio, biological, and tabular domains with a single 3B parameter model.

Conclusion: MARVIS offers a versatile, training-free solution that avoids P.I.I. exposure and domain-specific training, with open-sourced code and datasets.

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized
models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent
performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but
typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional
modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive
Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small
vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS
transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then
leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully
interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision,
audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model,
achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of resampling weights ("zapping") in neural networks during continual learning, revealing faster recovery in domain transfer and complex task interactions influenced by optimizer choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of zapping in continual learning and how it affects learning and forgetting in neural networks.

Method: Experiments with convolutional neural networks in continual learning and few-shot transfer learning settings, using handwritten characters and natural images.

Result: Zapping accelerates recovery in domain transfer, and optimizer choice significantly influences learning/forgetting dynamics and task interactions.

Conclusion: Zapping and optimizer selection play critical roles in continual learning, affecting task synergy and interference during sequential learning.

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.

*Nicolas Salvy,Hugues Talbot,Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage metrics to reliably evaluate generative model sample quality, addressing fidelity and coverage issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quality metrics for generative models lack reliability and interpretability due to calibration and robustness issues.

Method: Proposes Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage by clipping sample contributions and nearest neighbor radii to prevent bias from outliers.

Result: Metrics show linear score degradation with poor samples, outperforming existing methods in robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage provide reliable, interpretable evaluation of generative model quality.

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years,
their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to
reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary
concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,
interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient
robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel
metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample
contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our
metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.
Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear
score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can
be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of
robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

### [80] [A Privacy-Preserving Indoor Localization System based on Hierarchical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01581)
*Masood Jan,Wafa Njima,Xun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for indoor localization using DNN, addressing privacy and efficiency issues of centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional indoor localization has high errors and privacy concerns; centralized ML methods also face privacy, bandwidth, and reliability issues.

Method: Uses Federated Learning (FL) with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to enable dynamic indoor localization without centralized data aggregation.

Result: FL achieves performance close to centralized models while ensuring data privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and server reliability.

Conclusion: The FL approach is a viable, privacy-enhanced solution for indoor localization, advancing secure and efficient systems.

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet
of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often
produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data
collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising
solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically
require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server
reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the
nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy,
bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that
our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor
localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor
localization systems.

*Dalia RodrÃ­guez-Salas,Christian Riess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BranchNet is a neuro-symbolic framework converting decision tree ensembles into sparse neural networks, outperforming XGBoost in accuracy while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge symbolic and neural approaches, enabling gradient-based optimization without losing interpretability.

Method: Maps decision tree branches to hidden neurons, preserving symbolic structure, and uses gradient-based optimization.

Result: Outperforms XGBoost in accuracy on multi-class benchmarks, with compact and interpretable models.

Conclusion: BranchNet offers a promising balance of interpretability and performance, though it may need improvements for binary tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms
decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each
branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped
to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based
optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no
manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class
classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in
accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture,
training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in
symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on
binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze Muon, a novel optimizer leveraging neural network parameter structure, and explore its practical variants and properties.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Muon's convergence for four variants (with/without Nesterov momentum and weight decay), derivation of bounds, and validation via experiments.

Result: Weight decay tightens bounds on parameter and gradient norms; critical batch size for minimizing computational cost is derived.

Conclusion: Muon's theoretical properties are validated, with weight decay improving performance and critical batch size optimizing computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that
leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters. We
provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and
without Nesterov momentum, and with and without weight decay. We then show that
adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and
gradient norms, and we clarify the relationship between the weight decay
coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive Muon's critical batch
size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is
the stochastic computational cost, and validate our theoretical findings with
experiments.

TL;DR: An efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based sparse representations, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve online kernel dictionary learning by addressing computational complexity and accuracy limitations.

Method: Uses a recursive least squares (RLS)-based algorithm for dictionary updates, working with single samples or mini-batches.

Result: Outperforms existing online methods and achieves batch-trained model accuracy with higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and efficient for online kernel dictionary learning.

Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based
sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped
to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual
dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel
algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update
mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low
computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains
show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary
learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of
batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method uses GNNs to solve SAT problems by mapping k-CNF formulae to MILP problems, encoding them as bipartite graphs, and training GNNs. Theoretical results include invariance properties, limitations for foldable formulae, and universal approximation guarantees. Experiments show promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage GNNs for solving SAT problems by adapting techniques from MILP, addressing the need for efficient and scalable SAT solvers.

Method: Map k-CNF formulae to MILP problems, encode as weighted bipartite graphs, and train GNNs. Theoretical analysis includes invariance, limitations, and approximation guarantees.

Result: The method achieves permutation and equivalence invariance, identifies limitations for foldable formulae, and proves universal approximation with RNI. Experiments show promising performance.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based method effectively solves SAT problems with theoretical guarantees and practical promise, though limitations exist for certain formula classes.

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve
SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into
MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and
subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical
perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,
demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering
of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing
that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot
always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a
universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node
Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary
precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and
complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,
the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.
Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show
that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves
promising results.

### [86] [mGRADE: Minimal Recurrent Gating Meets Delay Convolutions for Lightweight Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01829)
*Tristan Torchet,Christian Metzner,Laura Kriener,Melika Payvand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mGRADE is a hybrid-memory system combining temporal 1D-convolution and minGRU for efficient multi-scale temporal processing on edge devices, outperforming pure models with lower memory use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for models capturing short- and long-range dynamics under tight memory constraints, where Transformers, RNNs, and TCNs fall short.

Method: Proposes mGRADE, integrating temporal 1D-convolution with learnable spacings and a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU) for flexible delay embedding and global context.

Result: Validated on synthetic tasks and pixel-by-pixel image classification, mGRADE outperforms pure models with 20% less memory.

Conclusion: mGRADE is an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal processing at the edge.

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short-
and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers
excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length
makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address
this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay
Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution
with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).
This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay
embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module
efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate
our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively
separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on
challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently
outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using
approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for
memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's
promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal
processing at the edge.

*Omkar Shende,Gayathri Ananthanarayanan,Marcello Traiola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PERTINENCE is an online method that dynamically selects the most suitable pre-trained DNN model for a given input, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency using a genetic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large DNNs are resource-intensive, but their high computational cost is often unnecessary for simpler inputs. Combining models dynamically can improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: PERTINENCE uses a genetic algorithm to train an ML-based dispatcher, selecting models from a pre-trained set based on input complexity.

Result: Tested on CNNs and ViTs, PERTINENCE achieves comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Conclusion: Dynamic model selection via PERTINENCE offers a practical way to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable
ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer
vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often
more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and
energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on
such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high
computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of
challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,
carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based
way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to
analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most
suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To
achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an
ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the
solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers
(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's
ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in
terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By
opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE
achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Motivation: To leverage large pretrained foundation models for accurate time-series modeling and anomaly detection across diverse datasets.

Method: Combines Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to create a generic model for univariate time-series.

Result: Preliminary results show effectiveness on multi-dimensional datasets, including a real mobile ISP dataset and KDD 2021.

Conclusion: FAE demonstrates potential for zero-shot anomaly detection in unseen time-series data.

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the
successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation
Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in
time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we
mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn
complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and
detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for
univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in
out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main
concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional
time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an
operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the explainability of Graph Convolutional Networks and model accuracy by estimating uncertainty, which can also aid in verifying results in critical applications.

Method: Introduces Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks, estimating uncertainty in outputs and layer-wise attentions.

Result: Demonstrates improved model accuracy and uncertainty estimation on datasets like Finnish board membership, NTU-60, NTU-120, and Kinetics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances model explainability and accuracy through uncertainty estimation, validated on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph

Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of
the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose
Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph

improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

*Kevin Innerebner,Franz M. Rohrhofer,Bernhard C. Geiger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing ensemble-based PINNs with a Bayesian PINN, using posterior variance for evaluation, showing improved performance over ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address convergence issues in PINNs for forward problems by ensuring effective information propagation from initial conditions.

Method: Replace ensemble approach with Bayesian PINN, evaluating posterior variance instead of consensus.

Result: Outperforms ensemble methods on benchmarks and competes with Adam/LBFGS-trained ensembles.

Conclusion: Bayesian PINNs offer a mathematically principled and effective alternative to ensemble methods.

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often
suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of
information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined.
Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the
active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii)
vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from
the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the
computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and
consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments
show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a
set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with
combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning approach combining LSTM and Transformers with pseudo-labeling (iForest and Autoencoders) is proposed for detecting anomalies in mental healthcare billing, addressing class imbalance and label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of mental healthcare billing leads to anomalies like fraud, and existing machine learning methods struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and sequential patterns.

Method: A hybrid model using LSTM and Transformers, trained on pseudo-labeled data via iForest and Autoencoders, is evaluated on two real-world billing datasets.

Result: The iForest LSTM baseline achieves high recall (0.963) on declaration-level data, while the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest recall (0.744) on operation-level data, albeit with lower precision.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning for complex, imbalanced anomaly detection in healthcare billing.

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including
fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection,
they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex
sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach
combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with
pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior
work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the
context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world
billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline
achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the
operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest
recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight
the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in
complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates learning rate control methods in deep learning, finding current approaches inconsistent across tasks and advocating for algorithm selection and new research directions like meta-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the state of learning rate control in deep learning, identifying gaps in reliability and the need for better algorithm selection.

Method: Comparison of paradigms like multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization, fixed schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning across tasks.

Result: Current methods perform well in specific tasks but lack reliability across settings; hyperparameter optimization becomes less effective with complex models.

Conclusion: Algorithm selection and new approaches like meta-learning are needed to improve learning rate control in deep learning.

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep
learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep
learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic
optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper
compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We
find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization,
fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform
very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.
This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate
control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning
communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches
becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when
combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A
focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable
methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly
strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate parameter estimation in physiological models is crucial for reliable digital twins, especially in Type 1 Diabetes due to complex glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional methods like MCMC are slow and computationally expensive.

Method: Uses Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation to model relationships between meal intake, insulin, and glucose levels, enabling faster, amortized inference.

Result: SBI outperforms traditional methods in parameter estimation, generalizes better to unseen conditions, and provides real-time posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The proposed SBI approach is efficient, scalable, and superior to traditional methods for parameter estimation in Type 1 Diabetes models.

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to knowledge transfer in model-based
reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large
world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently
distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact

*Yucen Lily Li,Daohan Lu,Polina Kirichenko,Shikai Qiu,Tim G. J. Rudner,C. Bayan Bruss,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current OOD detection methods, highlighting their fundamental misalignment with the task of identifying out-of-distribution data, and explores limitations of alternative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment in objectives of existing OOD detection methods, which rely on predictive uncertainty or features of supervised models, and to explore their limitations.

Method: Critically re-examines uncertainty-based and feature-based OOD detection methods, identifies their irreducible errors, and evaluates interventions like hybrid methods, scaling, and outlier exposure.

Result: Current methods conflate high uncertainty or far feature-space distance with OOD, leading to ineffective detection in common settings. Alternative approaches like unsupervised density estimation also have limitations.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for fundamentally new approaches to OOD detection, as existing methods and interventions fail to address the core misalignment.

Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty
or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this
paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection
procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the
wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,
since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected
to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently
misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from
dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based
methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while
feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with
being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD
detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.
Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit
hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty
representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental
misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density
estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their
own fundamental limitations.

### [97] [Automatic Rank Determination for Low-Rank Adaptation via Submodular Function Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01841)
*Yihang Gao,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SubLoRA introduces a second-order rank determination method for LoRA using submodular optimization, outperforming prior linearized approaches like AdaLoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods (e.g., AdaLoRA) rely on inaccurate linearized approximations of the loss function, especially when LoRA parameters are well-optimized. SubLoRA addresses this by leveraging second-order information (Hessian matrix) for better accuracy.

Method: Reformulates rank determination as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. Uses submodular function maximization and a greedy algorithm for efficient approximation. Includes a closed-form Hessian projection for computational efficiency.

Result: SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in rank determination and joint training, validated on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for PDEs.

Conclusion: SubLoRA combines theoretical rigor, second-order accuracy, and practical efficiency, proving superior to linearized approaches in LoRA rank determination.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

*Zeyi Liu,Shuang Li,Eric Cousineau,Siyuan Feng,Benjamin Burchfiel,Shuran Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 4D video generation model is proposed to ensure multi-view 3D consistency in videos, improving robotic planning and interaction by predicting future sequences from novel viewpoints without requiring camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing robots' ability to plan and interact in complex environments by understanding and predicting physical world dynamics.

Method: The model enforces multi-view 3D consistency using cross-view pointmap alignment during training, learning a shared 3D representation from RGB-D observations.

Result: Produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across simulated and real-world datasets, and enables trajectory recovery for robot manipulation.

Conclusion: The method supports robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Result: cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler and integrate seamlessly with the scientific Python ecosystem, as shown in 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics applications.

Conclusion: cp_measure enables scalable, reproducible, and automated image-based profiling pipelines for machine learning in computational biology.

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes efficient CNN-based models (SDNet for images, STDNet for videos) using Pixel Difference Convolutions (PDCs) and a reparameterization strategy (DCR) to achieve real-time salient object detection on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational expense of existing SOD models for deployment on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance.

Method: Combines traditional SOD contrast cues with CNNs via PDCs and DCR for efficiency. Introduces STDC for video SOD.

Result: Models achieve 46 FPS (images) and 150 FPS (videos) on Jetson Orin, outperforming lightweight models in speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed models offer superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for real-time SOD on constrained devices.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust single-modality framework for brain tumor segmentation handles missing MRI modalities using Holder divergence and mutual information, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods fail with missing MRI modalities due to issues like image quality or patient allergies.

Method: Uses Holder divergence and mutual information to maintain modality-specific features and dynamically adjust network parameters.

Result: Superior performance on BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets, especially with missing modalities.

Conclusion: The framework achieves accurate segmentation even with incomplete MRI data, proving its robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

TL;DR: AIGVE-MACS is a unified model for AI-generated video evaluation, providing numerical scores and multi-aspect comments. It uses a large benchmark (AIGVE-BENCH 2) and outperforms prior methods like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics lack interpretability and alignment with human evaluation, necessitating a robust framework.

Method: Leverages Vision-Language Models with token-wise weighted loss and dynamic frame sampling, trained on AIGVE-BENCH 2.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in scoring and comment quality, with a 53.5% quality improvement in video generation.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for human-aligned AI-generated video evaluation, releasing benchmarks and models publicly.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews weed mapping methods, focusing on data acquisition, processing, and mapping techniques to improve precision management and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in comprehensive literature reviews on weed mapping and enhance the field's progress by analyzing the entire mapping pipeline.

Method: Systematically examines state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensors/platforms), processing (annotation/modeling), and mapping (spatiotemporal analysis/decision tools) following PRISMA guidelines.

Result: Provides a holistic understanding of weed mapping, synthesizing key findings to guide future research and sustainable management systems.

Conclusion: The review serves as a foundational reference for developing efficient and scalable weed management solutions.

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

### [105] [Frequency Domain-Based Diffusion Model for Unpaired Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01275)
*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel frequency domain-based diffusion model (\ours) is proposed for unpaired image dehazing, leveraging amplitude spectrum reconstruction and phase correction to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for unpaired image dehazing introduce irrelevant content and ignore haze-specific frequency domain properties, particularly amplitude spectrum degradation.

Method: The proposed model uses a Diffusion Model (DM) for amplitude spectrum reconstruction, an Amplitude Residual Encoder (ARE) to bridge the gap between hazy and clear domains, and a Phase Correction Module (PCM) to refine the phase spectrum.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The frequency domain approach, combined with DMs and ARE/PCM modules, effectively addresses unpaired image dehazing challenges.

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: ET-Fuser introduces a novel method for unified feature representation in facial analysis using ensemble tokens and attention mechanisms, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack unified feature representation in single-task learning for facial analysis, despite advancements in CNNs and ViTs.

Method: ET-Fuser leverages task priors from pre-trained models to generate ensemble tokens via self-attention, sharing mutual information across encoders.

Result: The method shows statistically significant improvements in feature representations across various facial analysis tasks.

Conclusion: ET-Fuser efficiently enhances facial analysis by unifying feature representation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A technique called DiffusionLight uses a diffusion model to estimate lighting from a single LDR image by treating it as a chrome ball inpainting problem, with an improved faster version, DiffusionLight-Turbo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lighting estimation rely on limited HDR datasets, leading to generalization failures. This work aims to overcome this by leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model.

Method: The approach involves iterative inpainting to create a stable lighting prior (chrome ball) and fine-tuning an Exposure LoRA for HDR light probes. DiffusionLight-Turbo speeds up the process using a Turbo LoRA and LoRA swapping.

Result: The method produces high-quality lighting estimates and generalizes well to diverse scenarios, with DiffusionLight-Turbo achieving a 60x speedup.

Conclusion: DiffusionLight and its faster variant, DiffusionLight-Turbo, effectively estimate lighting from LDR images, addressing generalization and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel physics-based method estimates ground reaction forces from motion capture data, outperforming traditional deep learning models by integrating Euler's integration and PD algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Force plates, used to measure body dynamics, are limited to lab settings. This restricts learning human dynamics, prompting a need for a more accessible method using motion capture data.

Method: The approach combines physics laws and computational simulation, using Euler's integration and PD algorithms to compute ground reaction forces from motion capture data.

Result: Tested on the GroundLink dataset, the method outperformed baseline models in ground reaction force estimation accuracy and simulated root trajectory precision.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-based method offers a robust and accurate alternative to lab-dependent force plates, enhancing human dynamics analysis.

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

*Luxi Zhao,Mahmoud Afifi,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight method to transform neutral white balance corrections into aesthetically preferred ones, ensuring consistency across different cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial auto white balance (AWB) systems prioritize aesthetics over accuracy, and learning-based methods struggle with generalization across camera sensors. This paper aims to achieve aesthetic consistency in AWB.

Method: The proposed method learns a post-illuminant-estimation mapping to convert neutral corrections into aesthetic ones in a camera-agnostic space. It is lightweight (~500 parameters) and fast (0.024 ms on mobile CPU).

Result: Evaluated on 771 smartphone images from three cameras, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The approach enables consistent and stylized color rendering across unseen cameras while remaining compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques.

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

TL;DR: GTTA is a versatile method for enhancing trained models by perturbing PCA subspace projections of test inputs, forming robust ensembles, and using self-supervised learning to reduce computational costs without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general, off-the-shelf solution for improving model performance across diverse tasks like classification, regression, and object detection, addressing structural and systematic noise in data.

Method: GTTA applies random perturbations to PCA subspace projections of test inputs, forms ensembles to filter noise, and uses a self-supervised learning stage to refine the model.

Result: GTTA outperforms existing TTA methods and SoTA models on various datasets and tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and speech recognition.

Conclusion: GTTA is a highly effective, general-purpose method validated across multiple tasks, including specialized applications like salmon detection in underwater videos.

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

Conclusion: LTDR improves TER in vision-language models by addressing modality-specific routing challenges.

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [112] [3D Gaussian Splatting Driven Multi-View Robust Physical Adversarial Camouflage Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01367)
*Tianrui Lou,Xiaojun Jia,Siyuan Liang,Jiawei Liang,Ming Zhang,Yanjun Xiao,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGA is a physical attack framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust adversarial camouflage, improving cross-view effectiveness and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of prior camouflage-based attacks, which rely on unrealistic mesh priors and simulators, and lack robustness across viewpoints.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering, with min-max optimization to enhance robustness.

Result: Demonstrates superior adversarial effectiveness and cross-view robustness in experiments.

Conclusion: PGA offers a practical and robust solution for physical adversarial attacks, validated by extensive testing.

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

*Tianning Chai,Chancharik Mitra,Brandon Huang,Gautam Rajendrakumar Gare,Zhiqiu Lin,Assaf Arbelle,Leonid Karlinsky,Rogerio Feris,Trevor Darrell,Deva Ramanan,Roei Herzig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) introduce a few-shot reward modeling method using activation steering, outperforming existing approaches and mitigating reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs and LMMs to human preferences is challenging, and traditional reward modeling lacks adaptability to new preferences.

Method: Activation RMs leverage activation steering for reward signals with minimal supervision, avoiding additional finetuning.

Result: Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot methods and mitigate reward hacking, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PreferenceHack benchmark.

Conclusion: Activation RMs offer a scalable and effective solution for aligning models to human preferences, with potential for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

TL;DR: Active measurement is a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific measurement, combining AI predictions with human labeling via importance sampling to improve accuracy and reduce human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI workflows lack accuracy and statistical guarantees for scientific discovery, necessitating a more reliable method.

Method: Uses an AI model to predict measurements, samples units for human labeling with importance sampling, and iteratively refines the model and Monte Carlo estimates.

Result: Active measurement provides precise estimates even with imperfect AI models, reduces estimation error, and minimizes human effort when the AI is accurate.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust solution for scientific measurement, balancing AI efficiency with human oversight.

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

*Langyu Wang,Bingke Zhu,Yingying Chen,Yiyuan Zhang,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MUG, an audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo-label augmentation, to improve segment- and event-level predictions in weakly-supervised AVVP tasks. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the LLP dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for weakly-supervised AVVP struggle with improving both segment- and event-level predictions due to model limitations and weak supervision.

Method: MUG uses pseudo-label augmentation and an audio-visual Mamba network to enhance segment uniqueness and reduce noise from alternate modalities.

Result: MUG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLP dataset, with gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in visual and audio segment-level metrics.

Conclusion: MUG effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, improving performance in weakly-supervised AVVP tasks.

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

*Shuai Tan,Bill Gong,Bin Ji,Ye Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixTalk is a novel framework addressing identity leakage and rendering artifacts in talking head generation by decoupling identity from motion and using leaked identity to fix details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for talking head generation suffer from identity leakage and rendering artifacts, especially in extreme cases, limiting quality.

Method: FixTalk introduces Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to decouple identity from motion and Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI) to use leaked identity for fixing artifacts.

Result: Experiments show FixTalk effectively mitigates identity leakage and rendering artifacts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FixTalk successfully resolves key issues in talking head generation, improving quality and performance.

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Khanh Son Pham,Christian Witte,Jens Behley,Johannes Betz,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for coherent online HD map construction by predicting lane segments and road boundaries using prior SD map information, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous cars rely on HD maps, but constructing them online is challenging due to road topology complexity. The paper aims to address this by leveraging prior SD map data.

Method: A network architecture uses hybrid lane segment encodings (prior info + denoising) and temporal consistency from past frames to predict lane segments, topology, and road boundaries.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms previous methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the modeling scheme.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of coherent HD map construction, leveraging prior SD maps for improved performance.

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

TL;DR: A case-level MIL-based method for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound, using MoAE, MFS, and PPL, outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis of fetal abdominal malformations is critical for pregnancy management, but AI applications in this area are limited, especially for case-level diagnosis.

Method: Proposes a MIL-based method with MoAE for attention weighting, MFS for medical-knowledge-aligned feature selection, and PPL for enhanced MFS.

Result: Validated on 2,419 cases (24,748 images), the method outperforms competitors.

Conclusion: The approach advances case-level diagnosis of fetal abdominal anomalies without standard plane localization.

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

*Kuniaki Saito,Donghyun Kim,Kwanyong Park,Atsushi Hashimoto,Yoshitaka Ushiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaptionSmiths enables fine-grained control over caption properties (length, descriptiveness, uniqueness) in image captioning models without human annotation, outperforming baselines in lexical alignment and control accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing captioning models lack fine-grained control over caption properties (e.g., length, descriptiveness) and smooth transitions between language patterns.

Method: Quantifies caption properties as continuous scalar values and conditions the model via interpolation between extreme states (e.g., short vs. long captions).

Result: The model smoothly adjusts caption properties and achieves better lexical alignment, reducing length control error by 506%.

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths provides a flexible, annotation-free solution for diverse captioning needs, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

*Jiawei Gu,Ziyue Qiao,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight inference-stage technique for OOD detection by analyzing gradient consistency around ID and OOD samples, improving robustness without major pipeline changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is crucial for safe deep model deployment in open-world environments, where inputs may deviate from the training distribution. The paper leverages observed gradient behavior differences between ID and OOD samples.

Method: The proposed method short-circuits spurious gradient-exploiting features in OOD samples while preserving ID classification. A local first-order approximation avoids recomputing logits.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in OOD detection on standard benchmarks. The method is lightweight and minimally invasive to standard inference.

Conclusion: The technique offers a practical and effective solution for robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

*Wenjie Liu,Bingshu Wang,Ze Wang,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocShaDiffusion is a latent space diffusion model for document shadow removal, addressing color shadows with SSGM and SMGDM, and validated on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle color shadows in document images, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses DocShaDiffusion (latent space diffusion), SSGM for shadow masks, and SMGDM for guided denoising, with a perceptual feature loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively removes color shadows and preserves document details, supported by a new synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Chen Sun,Haiyang Sun,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Liejun Wang,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffMark is a robust watermarking framework using diffusion models to embed watermarks in facial images, enhancing resistance against Deepfake manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes threaten security and privacy, and existing watermarking methods lack robustness against such manipulations.

Method: DiffMark modifies diffusion model training and sampling, using facial images and watermarks as conditions, with a cross information fusion module and Deepfake-resistant guidance.

Result: Experiments show DiffMark effectively resists typical Deepfake manipulations.

Conclusion: DiffMark offers a robust solution for watermarking in the face of Deepfake threats.

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

TL;DR: TurboReg is a fast and robust estimator for Point Cloud Registration, using TurboClique and Pivot-Guided Search to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robust estimation in PCR are slow due to exponential time complexity, limiting their practicality.

Method: Proposes TurboClique (a 3-clique in a constrained graph) and Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) for efficient parallel searching.

Result: TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant speed improvements, e.g., 208.22Ã faster than 3DMAC.

Conclusion: TurboReg offers a scalable and efficient solution for robust PCR, outperforming existing methods in speed and recall.

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

*Yuxing Liu,Ji Zhang,Zhou Xuchuan,Jingzhong Xiao,Huimin Yang,Jiaxin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OoDDINO introduces a multi-level anomaly segmentation framework to address fragmented segmentation and global thresholding issues in anomaly detection, using a two-stage cascade architecture with uncertainty-guided detection and adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-wise anomaly segmentation methods neglect spatial correlations and struggle with variability in anomaly score distributions, leading to fragmented results and poor thresholding.

Method: OoDDINO combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level segmentation model, using Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) and Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net) for dynamic thresholding.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show OoDDINO's superiority and compatibility with other anomaly detection models.

Conclusion: OoDDINO effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved accuracy and flexibility in anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: NOCTIS is a novel framework for instance segmentation of unseen objects, leveraging Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2, outperforming existing methods without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of segmenting novel objects without retraining prompts the development of a generalizable model.

Method: Uses Grounded-SAM 2 for proposals and DINOv2 for embeddings, with cyclic patch filtering and confidence weighting for matching.

Result: Outperforms top RGB and RGB-D methods on BOP 2023 datasets for unseen object segmentation.

Conclusion: NOCTIS offers a powerful, training-free solution for instance segmentation of novel objects.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

Motivation: Existing methods like REPA fail to fully utilize discriminative representations during denoising inference, limiting their potential.

Method: REG entangles image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained models, enabling coherent image-class pair generation from noise.

Result: REG achieves significant training acceleration (63x faster than baseline) and outperforms REPA with 10x fewer iterations.

Conclusion: REG effectively leverages semantic knowledge to enhance image generation, offering a lightweight yet powerful solution for diffusion models.

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

### [127] [Optimizing Methane Detection On Board Satellites: Speed, Accuracy, and Low-Power Solutions for Resource-Constrained Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01472)
*JonÃ¡Å¡ Herec,VÃ­t RÅ¯Å¾iÄka,Rado PitoÅÃ¡k*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes efficient, low-power algorithms for onboard methane detection using hyperspectral satellite imagery, introducing Mag1c-SAS and testing fast methods like ACE and CEM. It integrates these with machine learning and evaluates band selection strategies, achieving significant speed improvements (up to ~230x faster) while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane leaks are a critical climate change concern, but current satellite missions rely on manual tasking, missing potential leaks. Onboard detection is needed, but traditional methods are too computationally intensive for limited hardware.

Method: The study tests fast target detection methods (ACE, CEM) and introduces Mag1c-SAS, a faster variant of Mag1c. These are integrated with U-Net and LinkNet models. Three band selection strategies are also evaluated.

Result: Mag1c-SAS and CEM are identified as promising, with ~100x and ~230x speed improvements over Mag1c, respectively. One band selection strategy outperforms traditional methods using fewer channels.

Conclusion: The work advances onboard methane detection with minimal hardware requirements, enabling timely leak detection. All code, data, and models are open-sourced.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose tracking for industrial metal objects is challenging due to their reflective surfaces, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The method employs active control points to generate edge features for optimization, avoiding 6DoF pose-based rendering, and includes an optimal control point regression for robustness.

Result: Effective performance in both dataset evaluation and real-world tasks, enabling real-time tracking of industrial metal objects.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a viable solution for real-time pose tracking of reflective metal objects in industrial settings.

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve the robustness of multi-modal fusion for HD map construction, focusing on data augmentation, a novel fusion module, and modality dropout training, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods prioritize accuracy over robustness, which is critical for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Method: The approach includes data augmentation, a new multi-modal fusion module, and modality dropout training, tested on 10 days of NuScenes data.

Result: The methods enhance robustness significantly and achieve top performance on the NuScenes clean validation set.

Conclusion: The findings advance robust and reliable HD map construction for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adjusting video captions to human preferences is challenging; AVC-DPO aims to improve this by aligning captions with what humans prioritize (temporal dynamics and spatial information).

Method: Post-training framework using direct preference optimization and enhanced prompts focusing on temporal and spatial details. Uses the same foundation model for preference-aware training.

Result: Achieved first place in the LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A, excelling in the Video Detailed Captioning benchmark (VDCSCORE metric).

Conclusion: AVC-DPO effectively aligns video captions with human preferences, demonstrating superior performance in detailed captioning tasks.

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the

TL;DR: A new training-free method for real-image editing with ReFlow models improves editability and text alignment without masks or source prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting ReFlow for real-image editing is challenging despite its superiority in image quality and text alignment.

Method: Analyzes intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks, leverages mid-step latent inversion, and adapts attention during injection.

Result: Outperforms nine baselines on two benchmarks, with human evaluations showing strong user preference.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for real-image editing with ReFlow, offering superior performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rule-based approach combining traditional and deep learning methods to improve tree crown detection for forest monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing global environmental issues like deforestation and biodiversity loss requires better forest monitoring, which can be automated using remote sensing and computer vision.

Method: Integrates traditional methods for feature extraction and segmentation with deep learning for tree crown detection, followed by rule-based post-processing to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Result: The proposed method increases the number of detected tree crowns by leveraging neighboring trees and localized operations, with comparative analysis provided.

Conclusion: The rule-based approach improves tree crown detection, though it has limitations and areas for improvement, offering a promising direction for automated forest monitoring.

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street-level datasets for autonomous driving and AI research contain PII, posing privacy risks. Current methods overlook non-biometric PII.

Method: Uses Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect and leverage interpretable PII features.

Result: Improved cross-dataset Re-ID performance, demonstrated from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np.

Conclusion: cRID effectively detects and mitigates PII risks, enhancing privacy while maintaining Re-ID utility.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

TL;DR: SAM-MaGuP enhances polyp segmentation by integrating boundary distillation and a 1D-2D Mamba adapter into SAM, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with weak or blurry polyp boundaries and lack generalizability for clinical use.

Method: Proposes SAM-MaGuP, combining boundary distillation and a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within SAM to improve feature learning and boundary resolution.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five datasets, demonstrating unmatched accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP sets a new benchmark in polyp segmentation, addressing key challenges like weak boundaries and generalizability.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Conclusion: Pose-based preprocessing and architectural tweaks like a register token significantly boost SLT performance, with code and data shared publicly.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can
improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub

Method: Proposes TrackingMiM, a nested Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, to independently process temporal and spatial patch tokens while encoding the template frame as a query token.

Result: TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision and higher speed on five UAV tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: TrackingMiM effectively addresses temporal inconsistency and computational inefficiency in UAV tracking, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Result: The dataset includes 1378 image series from 13 scanners, with baseline results for liver tissue classification and harmonization.

Conclusion: The work supports AI harmonization development by offering a standardized dataset and tools for evaluating stability and classification.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,

problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline

TL;DR: Proposes four IIR filter-based algorithms to remove ~99% of noise from event camera data while preserving valid signals, suitable for embedded devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras in neuromorphic vision produce noisy data streams, necessitating effective noise removal methods.

Method: Four algorithms based on IIR filters are developed and tested on noisy event datasets.

Result: The methods remove ~99% of noise, use only 30KB memory for 1280x720 resolution, and are embeddable.

Conclusion: The proposed IIR filter-based methods effectively denoise event data with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are
finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream
from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we
propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\%
of noise while preserving the majority of the valid signal. We have proposed
four algorithms based on the matrix of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters
method. We compared them on several event datasets that were further modified
by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision
sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a
resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in
embedded devices.

### [140] [A Gift from the Integration of Discriminative and Diffusion-based Generative Learning: Boundary Refinement Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01573)
*Hao Wang,Keyan Hu,Xin Guo,Haifeng Li,Chao Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IDGBR, a framework combining discriminative and generative learning to refine boundaries in remote sensing semantic segmentation, improving both low- and high-frequency feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models focus on low-frequency features (semantic correctness) but struggle with high-frequency details (boundary precision). Diffusion models excel at high-frequency details but lack semantic inference for low-frequency features.

Method: IDGBR integrates discriminative learning (for coarse segmentation) and diffusion-based generative learning (for boundary refinement). A conditioning guidance network combines the coarse map and original image to guide the diffusion process.

Result: Experiments on five datasets show IDGBR consistently refines boundaries in coarse segmentation results from various discriminative models.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach of IDGBR effectively addresses the limitations of purely discriminative or generative methods, enhancing both semantic and boundary precision in segmentation.

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchColour introduces a diffusion transformer-based pipeline for 2D animation colourization, reducing labor and computational costs while outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual colourization in 2D animation is labor-intensive; SketchColour aims to automate this process efficiently.

Method: Uses a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone with lightweight adapters and LoRA finetuning, avoiding ControlNet's inefficiencies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the SAKUGA dataset with fewer training data, producing coherent animations with minimal artifacts.

Conclusion: SketchColour offers a scalable, efficient solution for 2D animation colourization, with open-source availability.

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A controllable denoising framework adapts to noise levels using camera parameters (ISO, shutter speed, F-number) to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning denoising methods lack flexibility to adjust denoising strength based on noise levels and user preferences.

Method: Converts camera parameters into a vector to control and enhance a denoising network.

Result: Improves performance and adds controllability to standard denoising networks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates camera parameters for adaptive denoising, offering better flexibility and performance.

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper explores backdoor attacks in deep learning-based face recognition systems, demonstrating their feasibility and impact, and suggests countermeasures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the security blind spot of DNN backdoor attacks in real-life, unconstrained face recognition systems.

Method: Conducts a system-level study, demonstrating two backdoor attacks (face generation and landmark shift) and testing 20 pipeline configurations with 15 attack cases.

Result: Shows that a single backdoor can bypass entire system functions, even in feature extractors trained with large margin losses.

Conclusion: Provides best practices and countermeasures for stakeholders to mitigate backdoor vulnerabilities in face recognition systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

*Yue-Jiang Dong,Wang Zhao,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Song-Hai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthSync is a training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos, addressing issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video depth estimation suffer from scale discrepancies and geometric inconsistencies, especially in long videos, due to reliance on 2D priors and sliding windows.

Method: DepthSync introduces scale guidance to synchronize depth scales across windows and geometry guidance to enforce 3D geometric alignment within windows, leveraging diffusion guidance.

Result: Experiments show DepthSync improves scale and geometry consistency in depth predictions, particularly for long videos.

Conclusion: DepthSync effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a robust solution for consistent depth estimation in long videos.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

### [146] [Prompt Guidance and Human Proximal Perception for HOT Prediction with Regional Joint Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01630)
*Yuxiao Wang,Yu Lei,Zhenao Wei,Weiying Xue,Xinyu Jiang,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P3HOT is a framework for Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection, combining prompt guidance and human proximal perception to improve accuracy and category consistency. It introduces a new loss function and evaluation metric, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOT detection models are limited to single image types, causing oversegmentation and inconsistent categorization. P3HOT aims to address these issues.

Method: P3HOT uses semantic-driven prompts and human proximal perception to focus on relevant regions and dynamic depth perception. It introduces RJLoss for category consistency and AD-Acc. for better evaluation.

Result: P3HOT outperforms existing methods, with improvements of 0.7, 2.0, 1.6, and 11.0 in SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively.

Conclusion: P3HOT effectively enhances HOT detection by integrating prompt guidance, depth perception, and novel loss/metrics, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF scales NeRF for large scenes by tiling and out-of-core training, ensuring quality and efficiency on a single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory constraints of NeRF in large-scale 3D reconstruction from satellite imagery.

Method: Divides scenes into non-overlapping 3D tiles, crops images with overlap, and uses a 2x2 tile progression strategy with a segmented sampler.

Result: Achieves linear time complexity on a single GPU without quality loss.

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF effectively processes large satellite images efficiently and scalably.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

*Xu Zhang,Ming Lu,Yan Chen,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POLC introduces a perception-oriented latent coding method to enhance semantic richness in compressed domain inference, reducing fine-tuning overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MSE-optimized latent spaces lack semantic richness, and fine-tuning large models is computationally intensive.

Method: POLC enriches latent features semantically, requiring only a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning.

Result: POLC matches state-of-the-art generative coding in rate-perception and improves vision task performance with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: POLC offers a computationally efficient solution for high-performance semantic inference in compressed domains.

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation MDE models struggle in complex open-world environments with conditions like illumination changes, adverse weather, and sensor distortions.

Method: Proposes unsupervised consistency regularization finetuning and Spatial Distance Constraint for patch-level relative relationships.

Result: Demonstrates zero-shot capabilities across diverse benchmarks, including adverse weather, synthetic corruption, and general scenes.

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC effectively handles diverse environmental conditions, outperforming previous models in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

TL;DR: LASADGen introduces a linear attention mechanism (LASAD) for autoregressive image generation, addressing computational inefficiency and spatial dependency issues in transformers while maintaining high-quality output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR models using transformers face high computational complexity and memory overhead, and linear attention degrades image quality due to poor long-range dependency capture.

Method: Proposes LASAD, a linear attention mechanism with spatial-aware decay, preserving 2D spatial relationships in flattened sequences, and implements it in LASADGen for efficient, high-quality image generation.

Result: LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, balancing computational efficiency and spatial understanding.

Conclusion: LASADGen bridges the gap between efficiency and quality in autoregressive image generation, offering a viable alternative to transformer-based models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

TL;DR: SAILViT is a Vision Transformer designed to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by addressing parameter conflicts and semantic gaps through gradual feature refinement, improving performance in complex multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs struggle with direct co-training with LLMs due to initialization conflicts and modality gaps, limiting MLLM performance.

Method: SAILViT employs gradual feature learning for coarse-to-fine alignment and knowledge infusion, adaptable across various model sizes and architectures.

Result: SAILViT boosts MLLM performance significantly on the OpenCompass benchmark, demonstrating robustness across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: SAILViT effectively bridges ViTs and LLMs, enhancing MLLM capabilities in multimodal interactions.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuSTereo improves stereo matching in adverse weather by using synthetic data and a robust feature encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo matching models fail in adverse weather due to data scarcity and degraded feature extraction.

Method: Uses diffusion-based simulation for synthetic data and a hybrid ConvNet-transformer feature encoder.

Result: Enhances robustness and generalization in adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: RobuSTereo effectively addresses weather-related challenges in stereo matching.

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPoT introduces continuous token placement in Vision Transformers, bypassing grid constraints and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenization limits Vision Transformers by confining features to grids, hindering sparsity exploitation.

Method: Proposes Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT) with oracle-guided search for optimal token positioning.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains with fewer tokens, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: SPoT redefines sparsity as an advantage, enabling flexible and interpretable ViT architectures.

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

*Gianluca Monaci,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether image goal navigation can be efficiently solved with end-to-end RL training, investigating architectural choices and simulator impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if end-to-end RL training can replace dedicated methods for image goal navigation, impacting broader AI applications.

Method: Large study on architectural choices (late fusion, channel stacking, etc.) and their role in emergent relative pose estimators from RL training.

Result: Simulator settings influence recent methods, but capabilities can transfer to realistic settings. Navigation performance correlates with emerging relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: End-to-end RL training shows promise for image goal navigation, though simulator shortcuts exist. Transferability and skill correlations highlight potential.

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Motivation: Advancing human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer interaction by addressing the complexity of 3D/4D facial dynamics.

Method: Combines Cross-View Semantic Aggregation, Multiview Text-Guided Fusion, and a multiview consistency loss for coherent facial emotion recognition.

Result: Achieves top accuracy on benchmarks like BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous, and excels in 4D micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: FACET-VLM provides a robust, extensible solution for multimodal facial expression recognition in posed and spontaneous settings.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

TL;DR: AdaGCD introduces adaptive slot attention for generalized category discovery, dynamically clustering unlabeled images into known and novel classes without predefined class counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GCD methods rely on rigid assumptions like predefined class counts, limiting adaptability to real-world data variability.

Method: AdaGCD uses Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) to dynamically determine optimal slots, integrating adaptive representation and dynamic slot allocation for flexible clustering.

Result: Extensive experiments show AdaGCD's effectiveness in discovering categories in unlabeled datasets, leveraging spatial local information.

Conclusion: AdaGCD advances GCD by removing rigid assumptions, enabling flexible and adaptive category discovery in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

*Xinle Tian,Matthew Nunes,Emiko Dupont,Shaunagh Downing,Freddie Lichtenstein,Matt Burns*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a wavelet domain fingerprint for SPN extraction, improving accuracy and speed by avoiding inversion steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance source identification and image forensics by streamlining SPN extraction and comparison.

Method: Modifies wavelet-based SPN extraction by using wavelet domain fingerprints, eliminating the inversion step.

Result: Higher detection accuracy and significantly improved processing speed on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The wavelet domain fingerprint method is more efficient and effective for SPN extraction and comparison.

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

### [159] [Soft Self-labeling and Potts Relaxations for Weakly-Supervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01721)
*Zhongwen Zhang,Yuri Boykov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces soft self-labeling for weakly supervised segmentation, improving scribble-based training and outperforming complex systems, even full supervision in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of hard pseudo-labels in weakly supervised segmentation (WSSS) by introducing soft self-labeling to better represent class uncertainty and errors.

Method: Derives a principled auxiliary loss, evaluates CRF relaxations (convex/non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms linking network predictions to soft pseudo-labels. Proposes a continuous sub-problem solver.

Result: Soft self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training, outperforms complex WSSS systems, and can surpass full pixel-precise supervision.

Conclusion: Soft self-labeling is effective for WSSS, with broader applicability to other weakly-supervised problems.

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

### [160] [When Does Pruning Benefit Vision Representations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01722)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Andrea Bragagnolo,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how pruning affects vision models in interpretability, unsupervised object discovery, and alignment with human perception, identifying 'sweet spots' where sparsity improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of pruning on interpretability, representation learning, and human-aligned features in vision models.

Method: Analyzes different vision network architectures under varying sparsity levels, examining feature attribution, unsupervised object discovery, and human perception alignment.

Result: Identifies 'sweet spots' where sparse models show higher interpretability, generalization, and human alignment, though results vary by architecture and size.

Conclusion: Pruning's effects are complex and architecture-dependent, emphasizing the need for tailored investigation of its benefits for vision models.

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

### [161] [Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01788)
*Montasir Shams,Chashi Mahiul Islam,Shaeke Salman,Phat Tran,Xiuwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (ViTs) in medical imaging lack semantic meaningfulness in representations, making them vulnerable to small changes and unreliable for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether ViT representations are semantically meaningful and robust for medical imaging tasks.

Method: A projected gradient-based algorithm is used to analyze ViT representations.

Result: ViT representations are not semantically meaningful; small changes cause significant accuracy drops (over 60%).

Conclusion: ViTs pose a critical challenge for safety-critical medical systems due to their unreliable representations.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

### [162] [HOI-Dyn: Learning Interaction Dynamics for Human-Object Motion Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01737)
*Lin Wu,Zhixiang Chen,Jianglin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOI-Dyn is a framework for generating realistic 3D human-object interactions by modeling them as a driver-responder system, using a transformer-based dynamics model and a residual-based loss for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model detailed interaction dynamics, leading to implausible behaviors.

Method: Uses a transformer-based interaction dynamics model to predict object responses to human motion, with a residual-based dynamics loss for consistency.

Result: Improves the quality of HOI generation and provides a feasible evaluation metric.

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn effectively enhances interaction realism and consistency.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

### [163] [DeRIS: Decoupling Perception and Cognition for Enhanced Referring Image Segmentation through Loopback Synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01738)
*Ming Dai,Wenxuan Cheng,Jiang-jiang Liu,Sen Yang,Wenxiao Cai,Yanpeng Sun,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRIS decomposes Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) into perception and cognition modules, identifying cognitive capacity as the main bottleneck. It introduces a Loopback Synergy mechanism and data augmentation to improve performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RIS studies lack systematic analysis of bottlenecks. DeRIS aims to address this by decomposing RIS into perception and cognition for better understanding and performance.

Method: DeRIS splits RIS into perception and cognition, uses Loopback Synergy for module interaction, and employs non-referent sample conversion for data augmentation.

Result: DeRIS improves segmentation precision and image-text comprehension, showing adaptability to non- and multi-referent scenarios without architectural changes.

Conclusion: DeRIS effectively addresses RIS bottlenecks by enhancing cognitive capacity and synergy, offering a versatile solution for diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at
https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DeRIS.

### [164] [Calibrated Self-supervised Vision Transformers Improve Intracranial Arterial Calcification Segmentation from Clinical CT Head Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01744)
*Benjamin Jin,Grant Mair,Joanna M. Wardlaw,Maria del C. ValdÃ©s HernÃ¡ndez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs pre-trained with MAE outperform supervised nnU-Net in 3D medical image segmentation for IAC, showing robustness and clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs are underutilized in 3D medical imaging despite their potential for self-supervised training, which avoids costly annotations. IAC quantification can aid in large-scale risk assessment for neurovascular diseases.

Method: Pre-train ViTs using MAE on heterogeneous clinical trial data (IST-3), then fine-tune for IAC segmentation. Key evaluations include patch size, upsampling methods, and clinical robustness.

Result: MAE pre-trained ViTs surpass nnU-Net by 3.2 Dice points, perform better with low patch sizes, and improve robustness to slice thickness. Clinical risk classification improves by 46%.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ViTs are effective for 3D medical image segmentation, offering superior performance and clinical applicability for IAC quantification.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

*Nora Gourmelon,Marcel Dreier,Martin Mayr,Thorsten Seehaus,Dakota Pyles,Matthias Braun,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces self-supervised pretraining techniques and a hybrid model for tracking glacier calving fronts using SAR imagery, achieving improved accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate monitoring of glacier ice loss is critical, but current deep learning models using ImageNet-pretrained weights are suboptimal for SAR imagery due to domain differences.

Method: Proposes two self-supervised pretraining techniques and a hybrid Swin Transformer-CNN model, pretrained on the SSL4SAR dataset.

Result: The model achieves a mean distance error of 293 m on the CaFFe benchmark, outperforming prior methods by 67 m, and an ensemble reaches 75 m, close to human performance (38 m).

Conclusion: The advancements enable precise seasonal monitoring of glacier calving fronts, addressing the limitations of current models.

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

*Peng Zheng,Junke Wang,Yi Chang,Yizhou Yu,Rui Ma,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCon introduces a novel autoregressive framework for visual generation by conditioning continuous tokens on discrete signals, avoiding quantization loss and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the information loss in AR-based visual generation due to quantization and the challenges of continuous token modeling.

Method: DisCon models conditional probability of continuous representations on discrete tokens, avoiding direct continuous token prediction.

Result: Achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256Ã256 generation, surpassing state-of-the-art AR methods.

Conclusion: DisCon effectively balances fidelity and optimization challenges in visual generation by leveraging discrete-conditioned continuous modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

*Zihong Guo,Chen Wan,Yayin Zheng,Hailing Kuang,Xiaohai Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Segmented Gaussian Pyramid (SGP) attack method to improve adversarial example transferability, especially against defense models, using multi-scale transformations and gradient averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the security challenge posed by transferable adversarial examples in deep neural networks, particularly when attacking unknown models.

Method: The SGP method employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling to create multi-scale examples, computes gradients for each scale, and averages them to determine adversarial perturbations.

Result: SGP significantly boosts attack success rates against black-box defense models, with improvements ranging from 2.3% to 32.6%.

Conclusion: The SGP method is highly extensible and effective for enhancing adversarial attack transferability, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

### [168] [FreeLoRA: Enabling Training-Free LoRA Fusion for Autoregressive Multi-Subject Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01792)
*Peng Zheng,Ye Wang,Rui Ma,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeLoRA is a framework for multi-subject personalization in image generation without training, using subject-specific LoRA modules and Subject-Aware Inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-subject personalization, requiring complex tuning or optimization. FreeLoRA aims to simplify this process.

Method: Uses Full Token Tuning for subject-specific LoRA modules and Subject-Aware Inference for training-free fusion of multiple subjects.

Result: Achieves strong performance in subject fidelity and prompt consistency.

Conclusion: FreeLoRA provides a simple, effective solution for multi-subject personalization in image generation.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

*Shengli Zhou,Jianuo Zhu,Qilin Huang,Fangjing Wang,Yanfu Zhang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCNQA, a 3D VQA model using hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision to ensure rational reasoning pathways, outperforming answer-centric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of answer-centric supervision in 3D VQA, which lacks reasoning pathway oversight and risks superficial shortcuts, and underthinking in slow-thinking methods.

Method: Proposes HCNQA, which mimics human gradual focus by hierarchically supervising three phases of concentration narrowing to guide rational reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates better performance and ensures development of effective reasoning pathways compared to answer-centric methods.

Conclusion: HCNQA effectively addresses reasoning pathway supervision, improving 3D VQA model performance and rationality.

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

*Bin Rao,Haicheng Liao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Bonan Wang,Jiaxun Zhang,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMD framework improves trajectory prediction by addressing long-tail data imbalance using adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore diversity and uncertainty in long-tail trajectory patterns, crucial for autonomous driving safety.

Method: Combines MoCo-DT and DCL modules, trajectory augmentation, and online clustering for dynamic adaptation.

Result: AMD outperforms in long-tail prediction and overall accuracy on nuScenes and ETH/UCY datasets.

Conclusion: AMD effectively handles complex scenarios and enhances prediction robustness.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

*Rahul Ramachandran,Ali Garjani,Roman Bachmann,Andrei Atanov,OÄuzhan Fatih Kar,Amir Zamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks multimodal foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) on standard computer vision tasks, revealing their strengths and limitations compared to specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the vision understanding capabilities of multimodal foundation models, which are primarily trained for text tasks, and address challenges like task translation and API limitations.

Method: Translate standard vision tasks into text-promptable and API-compatible tasks using prompt chaining for benchmarking.

Result: Models lag behind specialist models but are respectable generalists, perform better on semantic than geometric tasks, and vary in sensitivity to prompts. GPT-4o leads in non-reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Multimodal foundation models show promise as generalists but have limitations, with performance gaps in geometric tasks and quirks in image generation.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

TL;DR: A novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework using a triple-camera smartphone system improves accuracy by 30% over single-camera methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral reconstruction from RGB images is ill-posed due to spectral information loss; existing single-image methods are limited in accuracy.

Method: Proposes MI-HSR with a triple-camera smartphone system (two lenses with spectral filters) and introduces the Doomer dataset for validation.

Result: Achieves 30% more accurate spectra estimation compared to single-camera setups.

Conclusion: Multi-view spectral filtering with commodity hardware enables more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging.

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

*Zhuoyang Zhang,Luke J. Huang,Chengyue Wu,Shang Yang,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) accelerates autoregressive image generation by enabling flexible parallelization and locality-aware ordering, reducing steps significantly without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive image generation is memory-bound and slow; existing parallelization methods are limited. LPD aims to achieve high parallelization while maintaining quality.

Method: Introduces Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling (learnable position queries) and Locality-aware Generation Ordering (minimizes dependencies, maximizes context).

Result: Reduces generation steps from 256 to 20 (256x256) and 1024 to 48 (512x512), with 3.4x lower latency than prior methods.

Conclusion: LPD effectively balances speed and quality in autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained platforms like mobile devices is challenging due to high computation and memory demands.

Method: The approach uses reparameterization, Incremental Weight Optimization, a Feature Self-Transform module, and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism, optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses deployment challenges for mobile IE, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress
in image enhancement (IE). However, deploying deep learning models on
resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices, remains challenging due
to high computation and memory demands. To address these challenges and
facilitate real-time IE on mobile, we introduce an extremely lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with around 4K parameters. Our
approach integrates reparameterization with an Incremental Weight Optimization
strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a
Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism,
optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework,
we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per
second (FPS) while delivering competitive image quality, achieving the best
trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will
be available at https://github.com/AVC2-UESTC/MobileIE.git.

*Guiqiu Liao,Matjaz Jogan,Marcel Hussing,Edward Zhang,Eric Eaton,Daniel A. Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module to improve object-centric slot attention for surgical videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous scenes in real-world applications like surgery are hard to parse into meaningful slots, and current adaptive slot count methods perform poorly on surgical videos.

Method: Proposes a DTST module trained for temporal reasoning and predicting optimal future slot initialization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surgical databases.

Conclusion: Unsupervised object-centric methods can be effectively applied to real-world healthcare data, such as surgical videos.

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

### [176] [Self-Reinforcing Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation for Semi-Supervised Lifelong Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01884)
*Kunlun Xu,Fan Zhuo,Jiangmeng Li,Xu Zou,Jiahuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPRED, a framework for Semi-Supervised Lifelong Person Re-Identification (Semi-LReID), addressing performance degradation in unlabeled data scenarios by combining dynamic prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and dual-knowledge purification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often have limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, causing performance issues in existing LReID methods. The paper aims to improve long-term adaptation in Semi-LReID.

Method: SPRED uses learnable identity prototypes for pseudo-label generation and a dual-knowledge cooperation scheme to refine noisy labels, creating a self-reinforcing cycle for better unlabeled data utilization.

Result: Experiments on Semi-LReID benchmarks show SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SPRED effectively enhances Semi-LReID by improving pseudo-label quality and knowledge propagation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

*Qingdong He,Xueqin Chen,Chaoyi Wang,Yanjie Pan,Xiaobin Hu,Zhenye Gan,Yabiao Wang,Chengjie Wang,Xiangtai Li,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reason50K, a dataset for hypothetical instruction reasoning in image editing, and ReasonBrain, a framework leveraging MLLMs and diffusion models for complex implicit instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex implicit instructions and lack datasets for reasoning-aware editing.

Method: Proposes ReasonBrain with a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction module and Cross-Modal Enhancer for detailed reasoning and execution.

Result: ReasonBrain outperforms baselines in reasoning scenarios and shows zero-shot generalization to conventional tasks.

Conclusion: The work advances instruction-based image editing by addressing reasoning gaps and provides a public dataset and framework.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for creating patient-specific digital twins (DTs) to assess deformable image registration (DIR) accuracy in gastrointestinal (GI) organs, validated against real patient data and applied to evaluate DIR methods and dose warping errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical DIR implementation lacks reliable voxel-based accuracy metrics for highly mobile GI organs, necessitating a robust validation method.

Method: Generated 21 motion phases simulating GI motion from static 3D scans using analytical models, validated against real 4D MRI data, and assessed six DIR methods with metrics like target registration error and Hausdorff distance.

Result: DTs matched real-patient gastric motion closely (mean motion amplitude within 0.8 mm) and provided detailed DIR performance metrics and dose warping validation.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a rigorous tool for testing DIR accuracy in dynamic, complex regions, enhancing spatial and dosimetric precision.

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

*Ranjan Sapkota,Zhichao Meng,Martin Churuvija,Xiaoqiang Du,Zenghong Ma,Manoj Karkee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework fuses multi-seasonal tree structure data using RGB-D imagery, YOLOv9-Seg, Kinect Fusion, and Fast GICP to improve robotic orchard automation despite foliage occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense foliage in the canopy season occludes tree structures, limiting machine vision, while dormant season offers better visibility. Integrating multi-seasonal data can enhance robotic crop management.

Method: Combines RGB-D imagery from dormant and canopy seasons using YOLOv9-Seg for segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D reconstruction, and Fast GICP for model alignment.

Result: Achieved high accuracy: MSE 0.0047, mAP@50 0.78 for trunks; RMSE 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter; Fast GICP fitness score 0.00197.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise robotic operations by overcoming occlusion challenges, improving pruning and thinning in orchards.

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

TL;DR: IC-Custom is a unified framework for image customization, integrating position-aware and position-free paradigms via in-context learning, outperforming existing methods with minimal parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image customization methods lack a universal framework, limiting their versatility across scenarios.

Method: IC-Custom uses in-context learning with DiT's attention mechanism, introducing ICMA for task handling and boundary-aware embeddings.

Result: IC-Custom achieves 73% higher human preference in identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment, training only 0.4% of original parameters.

Conclusion: IC-Custom offers a versatile, efficient solution for industrial image customization, supported by extensive evaluations.

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

*Zhentan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces evMLP, a model using MLPs with an event-driven local update mechanism for efficient processing of image patches, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency in vision tasks by selectively processing only changed patches (events) in sequential data like videos.

Method: Proposes evMLP with an event-driven local update mechanism, where MLPs independently process patches and only update those with changes (events).

Result: evMLP achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet and reduces computational costs on video datasets while maintaining output consistency.

Conclusion: evMLP offers a computationally efficient alternative for vision tasks, especially in sequential data processing, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

TL;DR: CI-VID is a new dataset for text-and-video-to-video (TV2V) generation, addressing the lack of coherent multi-clip sequences in existing datasets. It enables models to produce story-driven content with smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for text-to-video (T2V) generation lack support for coherent multi-clip sequences, limiting the creation of story-driven content.

Method: Introduces CI-VID, a dataset with 340,000 samples of coherent video sequences and captions, and validates it with a multi-dimensional benchmark.

Result: Models trained on CI-VID show improved accuracy and content consistency in generating video sequences.

Conclusion: CI-VID enhances the quality and utility of video generation, enabling story-driven content with strong temporal coherence.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

TL;DR: The paper introduces LongAnimation, a framework for automated long animation colorization using a dynamic global-local paradigm to maintain color consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating long animation colorization reduces labor costs, but existing methods lack long-term color consistency.

Method: Proposes LongAnimation with SketchDiT, Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and Color Consistency Reward for global-local feature fusion.

Result: Effective in maintaining color consistency for both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (500 frames) animations.

Conclusion: LongAnimation achieves superior long-term color consistency, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

TL;DR: Kwai Keye-VL is an 8B-parameter MLLM designed for short-video understanding, leveraging a large dataset and innovative training to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with dynamic, information-dense short videos, a key digital medium. Keye-VL aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a 600B-token dataset and a four-stage pre-training plus two-phase post-training process, including a five-mode data mixture and RL alignment.

Result: Achieves SOTA on video benchmarks and remains competitive on image tasks. Introduces KC-MMBench for real-world video scenarios.

Conclusion: Keye-VL successfully addresses short-video comprehension while maintaining general vision-language capabilities, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeMorph is a tuning-free image morphing method that handles inputs with different semantics/layouts, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on finetuning, which is time-consuming and limited by semantic/layout discrepancies. FreeMorph aims to eliminate per-instance training while maintaining high fidelity.

Method: FreeMorph integrates guidance-aware spherical interpolation and step-oriented variation trends to modify self-attention modules, ensuring controlled transitions and identity preservation.

Result: FreeMorph is 10x ~ 50x faster than existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in image morphing.

Conclusion: FreeMorph sets a new benchmark for tuning-free image morphing by addressing key challenges in non-linear denoising and pre-trained model biases.

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

*Imran Mirza,Cole Huang,Ishwara Vasista,Rohan Patil,Asli Akalin,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALIBU is a benchmark to assess bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems, revealing biases and the need for nuanced fairness strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address implicit biases in LLM-based multi-agent systems to ensure fairness and equitable representation.

Method: MALIBU uses scenario-based assessments with two-phase evaluation: scoring responses by demographic personas and comparing paired responses.

Result: Quantified biases in LLM outputs, showing bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over neutrality.

Conclusion: Nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and transparent benchmarks are needed for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

*Huiling You,Samia Touileb,Erik Velldal,Lilja Ãvrelid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating abstractive summaries by comparing overlapping events in generated summaries, reference summaries, and original news articles, using a Norwegian dataset with expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods rely on human-authored summaries as gold references, focusing on overlapping units or similarity scores, but lack insight into event coverage.

Method: The approach calculates overlapping events between generated summaries, reference summaries, and original articles, tested on a richly annotated Norwegian dataset.

Result: The method offers deeper insight into event information in summaries compared to traditional evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Event-based evaluation provides a more meaningful measure of summary quality, especially for news articles.

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

*Simon BÃ¶rjesson,Erik Ersmark,Pierre Nugues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes geographic entry shifts in the Nordisk familjebok encyclopedia between its first (1876-1899) and second (1904-1926) editions, revealing a trend away from Europe towards other regions, influenced by global events like WWI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study intellectual shifts in Sweden by examining changes in geographic entries across editions of the Nordisk familjebok encyclopedia.

Method: Digitized texts were resegmented, entries matched using semantic embeddings, and geographic entries classified and linked to Wikidata for analysis.

Result: A significant shift in geographic focus from Europe to North America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and northern Scandinavia was observed, reflecting global changes like WWI.

Conclusion: The study confirms the encyclopedia's reflection of intellectual and geopolitical shifts, with data and code available for further research.

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The

*Adamu Lawan,Juhua Pu,Haruna Yunusa,Jawad Muhammad,Muhammad Lawan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA) for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), addressing the trade-off between computational efficiency and performance by combining bi-directional mLSTM with a novel fusion mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABSA methods struggle with balancing efficiency and performance, lacking global context or demanding high resources. The untapped potential of xLSTM in ABSA inspired this work.

Method: The proposed MEGA framework integrates bi-directional mLSTM with forward and partially flipped backward streams (PF-mLSTM) and a multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) to optimize short-range and global context.

Result: MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The MEGA framework effectively addresses ABSA challenges, offering a balanced solution for performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A debiasing algorithm reduces biases in text embeddings caused by confounders like source or language, improving similarity and clustering metrics without degrading out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text embeddings can be biased by spurious attributes (e.g., source or language), affecting applications that pool texts from different corpora.

Method: A debiasing algorithm removes information about observed confounders from encoder representations.

Result: Substantial reduction in biases, improved similarity and clustering metrics across tasks, with no degradation in out-of-distribution performance.

Conclusion: The debiasing algorithm effectively mitigates biases in embeddings while maintaining performance, making it useful for diverse applications.

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

TL;DR: The paper introduces gAIus, an LLM-based agent for legal tasks in non-English/Chinese contexts, focusing on Polish Civil Code. It proposes a retrieval mechanism outperforming embedding-based methods, improving GPT-3.5-turbo by 419% and GPT-4o-mini from 31% to 86%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in LLMs' ability to reference legal acts accurately for non-English/Chinese legal systems, particularly Poland.

Method: Introduces gAIus with a retrieval mechanism for explainable, human-friendly legal knowledge retrieval from the Polish Civil Code. Evaluated using a dataset from Polish law apprenticeship exams.

Result: Significant performance improvements: GPT-3.5-turbo boosted by 419%, GPT-4o-mini's score rose from 31% to 86%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of specialized LLM architectures for legal tasks and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base
their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of
non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.
At the end of our paper we show the possible future path of research and
potential applications of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4 shows moderate performance in simulating clinical decisions for diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma screening but lacks precision for complex tasks. Metadata inclusion had no significant impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in ophthalmology, specifically for interpreting retinal fundus images and simulating clinical decisions.

Method: A retrospective diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 was given structured prompts with or without patient metadata to assign ICDR severity scores, recommend DR referrals, and estimate cup-to-disc ratios for glaucoma.

Result: GPT-4 performed moderately for DR classification (accuracy 67.5%) and better for binary DR referral (accuracy 82.3%). Performance for glaucoma referral was poor (accuracy ~78%). Metadata did not significantly affect outcomes.

Conclusion: GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making but is not suitable for clinical use. It may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE-RAG improves RAG systems by rethinking evidence, addressing conflicts, and refining retrieved content for reliable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge conflicts in RAG systems can undermine reliability, necessitating a framework to rethink and synthesize evidence.

Method: CARE-RAG derives parameter-aware and context-aware evidence, uses conflict-driven summarization, and includes QA Repair for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms RAG baselines, especially with noisy or conflicting evidence.

Conclusion: CARE-RAG enhances trustworthiness in RAG systems by systematically addressing evidence conflicts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompactDS, a web-scale datastore for Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), improving accuracy on reasoning-intensive benchmarks like MMLU and MATH by combining high-quality, diverse data sources with efficient retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RAG systems struggled with reasoning-intensive tasks due to limited datastores. The authors aim to address this by creating a compact, high-quality, and diverse datastore aligned with pretraining data.

Method: Developed CompactDS, filtering most web content to retain a high-quality subset. Used in-memory approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) and on-disk exact search for efficient retrieval.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements (10-33%) across benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, MATH) and model sizes (8B-70B), outperforming web search engines and complex RAG systems.

Conclusion: CompactDS demonstrates the importance of diverse, high-quality data for RAG, offering simplicity and reproducibility while matching or surpassing existing solutions.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

*Kai Liu,Bowen Xu,Shaoyu Wu,Xin Chen,Hao Zhou,Yongliang Tao,Lulu Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaRoSA introduces layerwise rotated sparse activation for LLM inference, improving efficiency without extra training or magnitude-based pruning, achieving consistent sparsity and speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for activation sparsity in LLMs either require recovery training or rely on unstable magnitude-based pruning, limiting real-world adoption.

Method: LaRoSA uses layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform activations for sparsification, employing Top-K selection for consistent sparsity and speed-up.

Result: For LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA shows minimal performance loss (0.17 perplexity gap), 1.30x speed-up, and reduces accuracy gaps in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: LaRoSA is a robust method for activation sparsification, offering stable efficiency gains across LLMs without additional training.

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

Abstract: Navigating the complexities of physics reasoning has long been a difficult

conceptual understanding and adept problem-solving techniques. In this study,
we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models,
such as Deepseek-R1, to address a diverse spectrum of physics problems curated
from the challenging SciBench benchmark. Our comprehensive experimental
evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do
they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynPref-40M, a large-scale preference dataset, and Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of reward models, to address limitations in current reward models by improving data quality and scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models perform poorly due to limitations in preference datasets, which are narrow, synthetic, or lack quality control.

Method: A human-AI synergistic pipeline curates a large-scale dataset (SynPref-40M), and Skywork-Reward-V2 models are trained on a subset of this data.

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks, demonstrating versatility and high-quality alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the importance of data quality and human-AI synergy in advancing reward models, unlocking potential in existing datasets.

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

TL;DR: A deep learning method using attention mechanisms is proposed for unified modeling of information extraction and multi-label disease prediction in EHR texts, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unstructured nature and high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts.

Method: Transformer-based architecture with multi-layer self-attention for representation learning and a Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier, enhanced by context-aware semantic alignment.

Result: The model consistently outperforms existing methods across metrics and generalizes well under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient foundation for clinical text processing and practical value for multi-label medical tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling
tasks.

*Tianyu Liu,Qitan Lv,Hao Li,Xing Gao,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitSpec improves speculative decoding by using the last token's logit to predict and retrieve draft tokens, achieving significant speedup in LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-based speculative decoding often fails to find accurate draft tokens. LogitSpec addresses this by leveraging the predictive power of the last token's logit.

Method: LogitSpec generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) using the last logit to predict the next next token, and (2) retrieving references for both the next and next next tokens.

Result: Achieves up to 2.61Ã speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens per decoding step.

Conclusion: LogitSpec is a training-free, plug-and-play solution that enhances speculative decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes using direct preference optimization (DPO) to personalize LLM-based automatic text simplification (ATS) for individuals with intellectual disabilities, incorporating their feedback to improve alignment with their needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based ATS systems lack personalization for target groups like individuals with intellectual disabilities, as they don't incorporate preference feedback during training.

Method: Extends supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with DPO, using human feedback from the target group to post-train LLM-based ATS models. A pipeline for personalized ATS development is also proposed.

Result: Demonstrates the importance of involving target group members in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions, improving alignment with human expectations.

Conclusion: This work advances personalized inclusive AI by integrating feedback from both experts and target group individuals, enhancing text simplification for accessibility.

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

*Ãlvaro Zaera,Diana Nicoleta Popa,Ivan Sekulic,Paolo Rosso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A modular framework combining uncertainty modeling and fine-tuned LLMs for efficient and accurate OOS intent detection in TODS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of OOS intent detection to enhance robustness in TODS for unseen and ambiguous queries.

Method: Uses uncertainty estimation on in-scope intent detection outputs, followed by a fine-tuned LLM for high-uncertainty cases.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OOS benchmarks, including real-world TODS data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, integrating traditional methods with LLMs.

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

### [203] [Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01543)
*Quang Minh Nguyen,Taegyoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: External information like Wikipedia and web search often degrades stance detection performance in large language models (LLMs), contrary to prior findings with BERT-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the impact of external information on stance detection in LLMs, given its known benefits in BERT-based systems.

Method: Systematic evaluation across eight LLMs and three datasets with 12 targets, using Wikipedia and web search external information.

Result: External information degrades performance (macro F1 drops up to 27.9%), as LLMs align predictions with the provided information's stance/sentiment rather than ground truth.

Conclusion: LLMs are prone to information biases in stance detection, and fine-tuning only partially mitigates this issue, highlighting risks in their use.

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

TL;DR: The paper introduces LUSTER, an LLM-based unified system for task-oriented dialogue with end-to-end reinforcement learning, optimizing for task success and emotional responsiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building effective and emotionally intelligent task-oriented dialogue systems remains challenging despite advances in LLMs.

Method: Proposes LUSTER, combining LLMs with structured reward modeling for short-term (user sentiment) and long-term (task success) rewards.

Result: LUSTER demonstrates more resilient and emotionally responsive dialogue systems.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical path for next-generation conversational agents.

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

### [206] [Confidence and Stability of Global and Pairwise Scores in NLP Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01633)
*Georgii Levtsov,Dmitry Ustalov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares global scores and pairwise comparisons for evaluating NLP models, finding global scores reliable for overall rankings but weak in detecting rare errors, while pairwise comparisons excel in identifying strong models with low global scores but require more comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strengths and weaknesses of global scores and pairwise comparisons in NLP model evaluation for better decision-making.

Method: Computational experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets using global metrics and the Bradley-Terry model for pairwise comparisons.

Result: Global scores provide reliable overall rankings but miss rare errors; pairwise comparisons identify strong models with low global scores but need more comparisons for convergence.

Conclusion: Both evaluation strategies have trade-offs; the choice depends on the context, with global scores for overall rankings and pairwise comparisons for nuanced model strengths.

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

### [207] [Adapting Language Models to Indonesian Local Languages: An Empirical Study of Language Transferability on Zero-Shot Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01645)
*Rifki Afina Putri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how pre-trained language models transfer to low-resource Indonesian local languages for sentiment analysis, comparing zero-shot and adapter-based methods. Performance varies by language exposure, with MAD-X improving results, especially for seen and partially seen languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the transferability of pre-trained models to low-resource Indonesian local languages and identify factors influencing performance.

Method: Evaluated zero-shot and adapter-based transfer (MAD-X) on ten local languages using monolingual and multilingual models. Languages were grouped by pre-training exposure: seen, partially seen, and unseen.

Result: Multilingual models perform best on seen languages, moderately on partially seen, and poorly on unseen. MAD-X improves performance without target-language labels. Tokenization analysis shows prior language exposure is the strongest predictor of success.

Conclusion: Model performance on low-resource languages depends heavily on prior exposure. MAD-X is effective for seen and partially seen languages, suggesting adapter-based methods can enhance transferability.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

### [208] [AdamMeme: Adaptively Probe the Reasoning Capacity of Multimodal Large Language Models on Harmfulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01702)
*Zixin Chen,Hongzhan Lin,Kaixin Li,Ziyang Luo,Zhen Ye,Guang Chen,Zhiyong Huang,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdamMeme is an adaptive, agent-based framework for evaluating multimodal LLMs' understanding of harmful memes, addressing limitations of static benchmarks by dynamically updating data and probing model reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for harmful meme understanding in mLLMs are static and lack adaptability to evolving online content, necessitating a more dynamic evaluation approach.

Method: Proposes AdamMeme, a multi-agent framework that iteratively updates meme data with challenging samples to assess mLLMs' reasoning and harmfulness interpretation.

Result: AdamMeme systematically identifies performance variations and specific weaknesses in mLLMs, providing fine-grained analyses.

Conclusion: AdamMeme offers a flexible, thorough evaluation method for mLLMs, enhancing understanding of their limitations in harmful meme interpretation.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StereoBias, a dataset for bias and stereotype detection, showing joint training improves bias detection in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing harm caused by bias and stereotypes in language models, especially in sensitive applications like content moderation.

Method: Joint learning of bias and stereotype detection using StereoBias dataset, comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models with QLoRA.

Result: Joint training significantly improves bias detection; decoder-only models perform competitively.

Conclusion: Leveraging stereotype information enhances fairness and effectiveness in AI systems.

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

*Oliver Wardas,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs and in-context learning to classify clauses in German employment contracts, finding that examination guidelines significantly improve recall for void clauses, though performance remains below human lawyers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal work is text-heavy and resource-intensive, but current NLP approaches lack interpretability and trustworthiness, limiting their use in dynamic legal environments.

Method: Collaborated with legal experts to extend a dataset and evaluated LLMs' ability to classify clauses as 'valid,' 'unfair,' or 'void' under three legal context variants: no context, full-text sources, and distilled examination guidelines.

Result: Examination guidelines significantly improved recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score (80%), but LLMs' performance with full-text sources was below human lawyers.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential to assist lawyers in contract legality review, but current methods have limitations, as evidenced by the gap between model and human performance.

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in tokenisation, particularly with emojis and homoglyphs, and their impact on corpus fidelity and linguistic analysis.

Method: Examines preprocessing techniques for digital texts to maintain accuracy in corpora and ensure repeatable linguistic interpretations.

Result: Highlights the need for detailed understanding of linguistic and technical aspects in tokenisation to improve corpus analysis accuracy.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of accurate tokenisation for reliable corpus-based research, affecting both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

Abstract: Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina &
Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides
the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,

TL;DR: MuRating is a scalable framework for multilingual data-quality assessment, improving LLM performance by transferring English quality signals to 17 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-quality methods are English-centric, limiting multilingual model performance.

Method: MuRating aggregates English raters via pairwise comparisons, projects judgments through translation, and trains a multilingual evaluator.

Result: MuRating outperforms baselines, enhancing accuracy on English and multilingual tasks, especially knowledge-intensive ones.

Conclusion: MuRating advances multilingual data selection, with future work needed on translation fidelity and bias.

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate evaluation awareness in models and its implications for AI safety and governance, given the potential for deceptive capabilities.

Method: Use linear probes on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct to separate evaluation and deployment prompts, analyzing model internals.

Result: Probes successfully distinguish between evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting models internally recognize this distinction. Safety evaluations are also classified as artificial.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for reliable evaluations and understanding deceptive model behaviors, proposing model internals as a tool for safety audits.

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

*Tianze Hua,Tian Yun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how vision-language AI models handle conflicting multimodal inputs, revealing biases towards specific modalities and identifying mechanisms like attention heads that influence modality preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal AI models behave when faced with conflicting inputs (e.g., mismatched image-caption pairs) and to explore the internal mechanisms driving their responses.

Method: The study tests vision-language models with inconsistent inputs (e.g., an image of a dog labeled as a cat) and analyzes their responses to identify modality biases and internal representational structures.

Result: Models often favor one modality over another, with preferences evident in their internal structures. Specific attention heads and "router heads" influence modality selection and can be manipulated to improve performance.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of how multimodal models detect and resolve conflicts, offering insights for controlling their behavior in complex environments.

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the MDACE dataset for explainable medical coding, evaluating plausibility of current systems and proposing match measures and recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency in automatic medical coding by evaluating explainability methods and understanding evidence alignment with code descriptions.

Method: In-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset, plausibility evaluation of explainable medical coding systems, and proposal of match measures.

Result: Ground truth evidence aligns partially with code descriptions; state-of-the-art approaches show high overlap with ground truth.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for developing and evaluating explainable medical coding systems based on findings.

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

TL;DR: JSON outperforms YAML and XML in parseability for clinical note attribute-value extraction, with structural robustness improving via targeted prompting and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the parseability of structured outputs (JSON, YAML, XML) from small language models for clinical note attribute-value extraction.

Method: Comparative analysis of JSON, YAML, and XML serialization formats, assessing parseability, structural robustness, and failure patterns.

Result: JSON consistently yields the highest parseability. Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models but declines for longer documents and certain note types.

Conclusion: JSON is recommended for clinical settings due to higher parseability, with practical guidance provided for format selection and prompt design.

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from
clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON,
YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability.
Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

*Arthur Wuhrmann,Anastasiia Kucherenko,Andrei Kucharavy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to analyze how LLMs replicate training data by focusing on low-perplexity sequences, revealing unexpected gaps in traceability and quantifying verbatim recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs' training data influences their outputs is critical for transparency, accountability, privacy, and fairness.

Method: A systematic pipeline extracts and traces low-perplexity sequences (high-probability text spans) back to their training data sources.

Result: Many low-perplexity sequences cannot be mapped to the training corpus; for those that match, the distribution of verbatim recall is quantified.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how training data impacts LLM behavior, highlighting gaps in traceability and the nature of verbatim recall.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

*Kenan Tang,Yanhong Li,Yao Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIY-MKG is an open-source system for polyglot language learning, addressing limitations of existing tools by enabling personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, adaptive quizzes, and user feedback for prompt refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools lack support for polyglot learners, customization, and suffer from cognitive offloading. DIY-MKG aims to solve these issues.

Method: DIY-MKG uses LLMs to build personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, offers rich annotations, and generates adaptive quizzes. User feedback refines prompts.

Result: Evaluation shows reliable vocabulary expansion and highly accurate quizzes across multiple languages.

Conclusion: DIY-MKG is robust and effective for polyglot language learning, leveraging LLMs for personalization and accuracy.

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

*Dongyi Ding,Tiannan Wang,Chenghao Zhu,Meiling Tao,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiCoTA improves small language models' reasoning by using intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and intermediate-length reasoning sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'SLMs Learnability Gap' where small models struggle with long-form reasoning due to limited capacity.

Method: Introduces MiCoTA, a framework using intermediate-sized models and sequences to bridge capacity and reasoning gaps.

Result: SLMs show significant reasoning improvements, e.g., Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B models achieve 3.47 and 3.93 score boosts.

Conclusion: MiCoTA effectively bridges reasoning gaps for SLMs, paving the way for future research in long-CoT distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

### [221] [High-Layer Attention Pruning with Rescaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01900)
*Songtao Liu,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel pruning algorithm for LLMs strategically prunes attention heads in higher layers and uses adaptive rescaling to maintain performance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pruning methods remove attention heads indiscriminately, ignoring their positions in the network, which can harm performance.

Method: Proposes a pruning algorithm targeting higher-layer attention heads and introduces adaptive rescaling to adjust token representation scales post-pruning.

Result: Outperforms existing structured pruning methods, especially in generation tasks, across 27 datasets and multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: The method improves pruning efficiency and maintains model performance, particularly in generation tasks.

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor
and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3)
Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

*Chengao Li,Hanyu Zhang,Yunkun Xu,Hongyan Xue,Xiang Ao,Qing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAPO, a new RLHF method, aligns LLMs with diverse human preferences using multi-objective optimization, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with conflicting human preferences is challenging.

Method: GAPO uses multi-gradient descent to balance conflicting objectives; P-GAPO incorporates user preferences for Pareto solutions.

Result: GAPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better helpfulness and harmlessness.

Conclusion: GAPO effectively aligns LLMs with diverse preferences, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

### [224] [NaturalThoughts: Selecting and Distilling Reasoning Traces for General Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01921)
*Yang Li,Youssef Emad,Karthik Padthe,Jack Lanchantin,Weizhe Yuan,Thao Nguyen,Jason Weston,Shang-Wen Li,Dong Wang,Ilia Kulikov,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies effective reasoning traces for distilling teacher model capabilities into student models, introducing 'NaturalThoughts' for improved reasoning transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze what reasoning demonstrations from a teacher model best enhance student model reasoning, addressing gaps in prior work.

Method: Curate 'NaturalThoughts' by selecting reasoning traces from a teacher model using a large question pool, analyzing factors like sample efficiency and scalability.

Result: Scaling data size helps, but selecting difficult examples with diverse reasoning strategies is more efficient. 'NaturalThoughts' outperforms existing datasets on STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-quality reasoning traces, especially challenging ones, significantly improve student model reasoning, with 'NaturalThoughts' proving superior.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

*Yu-Shiang Huang,Chuan-Ju Wang,Chung-Chi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision-oriented framework to evaluate NLG by measuring its impact on human and LLM decision outcomes, showing richer analytical texts improve collaborative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLG evaluation methods (e.g., n-gram overlap) poorly correlate with decision-making efficacy, necessitating a more practical approach.

Method: The framework evaluates generated texts (market digests) by assessing financial performance of trades by humans and LLMs using these texts.

Result: Neither humans nor LLMs outperform random baselines with summaries alone, but human-LLM collaboration excels with richer analyses.

Conclusion: Decision-oriented evaluation is crucial, revealing limitations of intrinsic metrics and the potential of human-LLM synergy.

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

TL;DR: The study compares OpenAI's Whisper and Facebook's Wav2Vec-BERT for Bangla ASR, finding Wav2Vec-BERT superior in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate state-of-the-art ASR models for low-resource languages like Bangla.

Method: Experiments with fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization on Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR datasets, measuring WER, CER, training time, and computational efficiency.

Result: Wav2Vec-BERT outperformed Whisper in all metrics, requiring fewer resources.

Conclusion: Wav2Vec-BERT is more effective for low-resource ASR, offering insights for robust system development.

Abstract: In recent years, neural models trained on large multilingual text and speech
datasets have shown great potential for supporting low-resource languages. This
study investigates the performances of two state-of-the-art Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) models, OpenAI's Whisper (Small & Large-V2) and Facebook's
Wav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments
using two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to
evaluate model performances. Through systematic fine-tuning and hyperparameter
optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection,
we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error
Rate (CER), Training Time, and Computational Efficiency. The Wav2Vec-BERT model
outperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior
performance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable
insights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource
linguistic settings.

### [227] [The Thin Line Between Comprehension and Persuasion in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01936)
*Adrian de Wynter,Tangming Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs excel in persuasive debates but lack deeper comprehension of dialogue structures and context, impacting their reliability as evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine LLMs' debate capabilities and their understanding of dialogue, given their increasing use in sensitive applications.

Method: Evaluate LLMs' debate performance and measure their comprehension of dialogical structures and pragmatic context.

Result: LLMs can debate persuasively but fail to demonstrate deeper understanding of dialogue. Awareness of AI involvement makes people more critical.

Conclusion: Persuasive dialogue does not require deep comprehension, suggesting pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.
