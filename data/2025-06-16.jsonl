Telecommunications\noperation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications\nindustry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,\nand human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified\nservice control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of\nOS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have\nhindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical\nfield. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications\nOperation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this\nbenchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating\nfour key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket\nhandling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To\nsystematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,\nwe categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling\ninto four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic\nNLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we\nleverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10\nopen-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)\nacross diverse scenarios.

As retrieval complexity\nincreases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,\ncurrent RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is\npresented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,\nparticularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled\nexperiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe\na consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify\nposition bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases\nlogarithmically with retrieval range.

In contrast,\nTversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a\nrepresentation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a\nfunction of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our\nwork offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in\ndeep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an\nestablished theory of psychological similarity."}

To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss\nduring the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the\npredictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient\ninformation for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,\nthe predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)\nmodules, which take up more than $5 \\times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this\nend, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM\nwithout obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive\nzero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nexisting pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive\nperformance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained\nweights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune."}

Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art.

Moreover, we extend our\nexploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.\nWe demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot\nperformance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,\nand resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is\nenabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the\nmulti-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual\nrepresentation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal\nperspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic\nambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.\nCode and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower."}

However, existing\napproaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as\nforecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred\nto as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This\nposition paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series\nreasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic\nprimitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This\nrealignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning\napproaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by\nsystematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task\nengineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective\nAlignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by\nprioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,\ncharacteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient\nreasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented\nmethod to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.\nAdditionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms\nand outline promising research directions."}

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

Even under this restrictive\nself-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of\nteams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\\ F_1$\nscores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and\nthe winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in\nTrack 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the\nminimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum\ndifference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\\ F_1$ score, we find that\nmodels with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,\nall of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a\nGPU."}

For each\n(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user\nclaims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it\nis incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired\noutcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth\nevaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree\nwith the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the\nmodel's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the\nmodel's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this\nbenchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to \"stick to its guns\" when\npresented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact.

These branches are\nconnected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers\nanatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,\nenabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained\nsemantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning\nfetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized\nvideo anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in\nzero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation\ntransfer."}

We have shown that\ntransformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible\nand carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we\npropose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based\nmodulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient\narchitecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or\noperation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a\ncompact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust\ntraining such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in\ncompact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact\ntransformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.\nThe new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the\nrobustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer.

We systematically evaluate leading LLMs\non diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,\nmarket report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques.

We introduce a\nmethodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language\nmodel (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training\na linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental\nto our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains\nits original language representations without adaptation to visual data.\nConsequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the\nLLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model\nto develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our\nexperimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes.
