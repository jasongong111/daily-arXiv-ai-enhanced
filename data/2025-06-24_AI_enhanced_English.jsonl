In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded\nvideos: infrared and microscope videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel FBS method using CSR for foreground modeling is proposed to handle degraded videos with low frame rates and noise, outperforming existing methods.", "motivation": "Existing FBS methods fail to accurately separate foreground and background in degraded videos due to limited feature capture and lack of explicit noise models.", "method": "Proposes a CSR-based foreground model and formulates FBS as a multiconvex optimization problem incorporating CSR, general features, and noise characterization.", "result": "The method effectively separates components in degraded videos (infrared and microscope) and outperforms existing techniques.", "conclusion": "The CSR-based FBS method is robust, capturing both specific and general features while handling noise, making it superior for degraded video analysis."}}

To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector.

In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios.

This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation.
