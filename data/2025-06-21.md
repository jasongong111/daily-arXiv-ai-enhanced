### [1] [CALM: Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14936)
*Maxwell J. Jacobson,Corey J. Maley,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks for context-sensitive decisions in multi-modal data, outperforming classical logic and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic logic systems lack nuance and grounding in multi-modal environments, while neural networks lack interpretable reasoning. CALM bridges this gap.

Method: CALM uses domain trees for predicates, refining analog truth values via neural networks and symbolic reasoning to ensure constraints.

Result: CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy in object placement tasks, surpassing classical logic (86.3%) and LLMs (59.4%).

Conclusion: CALM combines logic precision with neural multi-modal processing, paving the way for robust, interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

### [2] [MEAL: A Benchmark for Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14990)
*Tristan Tomilin,Luka van den Boogaard,Samuel Garcin,Bram Grooten,Meng Fang,Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEAL is a new benchmark for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), leveraging GPU acceleration for efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for continual learning (CL) in multi-agent settings are limited by CPU-based computation, hindering research progress.

Method: MEAL uses JAX for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient continual learning across 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC.

Result: Naive combinations of CL and MARL methods perform well in simple environments but fail in complex settings requiring coordination and adaptation.

Conclusion: MEAL identifies key architectural and algorithmic features necessary for effective CMARL, advancing research in this underexplored area.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

### [3] [Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15050)
*Tiantian Fan,Lingjun Liu,Yu Yue,Jiaze Chen,Chengyi Wang,Qiying Yu,Chi Zhang,Zhiqi Lin,Ruofei Zhu,Yufeng Yuan,Xiaochen Zuo,Bole Ma,Mofan Zhang,Gaohong Liu,Ru Zhang,Haotian Zhou,Cong Xie,Ruidong Zhu,Zhi Zhang,Xin Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Lin Yan,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-PPO improves PPO's efficiency for training LLMs by optimizing policy updates and response generation, achieving 2.5x faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's inefficiency in long-response generation due to on-policy nature and low hardware utilization motivates the need for a more efficient method.

Method: Proposes T-PPO with Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) and a mechanism for independent optimization of policy and value models, reducing redundant computations.

Result: T-PPO achieves up to 2.5x training efficiency improvement and outperforms competitors on AIME 2024 with a 32B model.

Conclusion: T-PPO is an effective and efficient alternative to PPO for training reasoning LLMs, addressing key limitations while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

### [4] [HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15196)
*Xianliang Yang,Ling Zhang,Haolong Qian,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework using LLMs to evolve and select heuristics for combinatorial optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic designs rely on manual expertise and lack generalization across diverse problem instances.

Method: HeurAgenix uses LLMs to evolve heuristics and dynamically select the best one for each problem state, with a dual-reward mechanism for fine-tuning.

Result: The framework outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating heuristic design for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

### [5] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207)
*Mohamad A. Hady,Siyi Hu,Mahardhika Pratama,Jimmy Cao,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores RL and MARL for autonomous Earth Observation (EO) mission planning in multi-satellite systems, addressing challenges like energy limits and coordination. It evaluates MARL algorithms in a realistic simulation, showing effective resource management and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LEO satellites for EO missions requires autonomous coordination, but traditional methods fail in real-time decision-making, prompting the use of RL and MARL.

Method: The study models single-satellite operations and extends to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks (PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, HAPPO) in a near-realistic simulation environment.

Result: MARL effectively balances imaging and resource management, addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and guidelines for autonomous satellite operations, advancing policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

### [6] [Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15225)
*Jiahao You,Ziye Jia,Chao Dong,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cooperative MEC framework using UAVs and vessels to address computation offloading and resource allocation challenges in MIoT, leveraging Lyapunov optimization and a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of MIoT demands efficient computation offloading and resource allocation, complicated by uncertain maritime tasks.

Method: A cooperative MEC framework is introduced, using Lyapunov optimization for task unpredictability and a Markov game approach with a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic for optimization.

Result: Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness in minimizing execution time and handling uncertain tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed solution efficiently addresses MIoT computation challenges through UAV-vessel cooperation and advanced optimization techniques.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

### [7] [Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377)
*Ruoyu Wang,Xinshu Li,Chen Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), a framework that improves visual navigation by modeling causal relationships in sequential data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods process historical observations without considering internal causal structures, limiting performance improvements.

Method: Proposes CAN with a Causal Understanding Module to enhance environmental understanding by leveraging causality.

Result: CAN consistently outperforms baselines in various tasks and environments, with gains attributed to the Causal Understanding Module.

Conclusion: The CAN framework generalizes well in Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without added computational cost.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

### [8] [Managing Complex Failure Analysis Workflows with LLM-based Reasoning and Acting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15567)
*Aline Dobrovsky,Konstantin Schekotihin,Christian Burmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores an LLM-based Planning Agent (LPA) to streamline Failure Analysis (FA) tasks by automating complex workflows, data retrieval, and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FA is complex and knowledge-intensive; integrating AI can automate tasks but requires efficient orchestration of models.

Method: Design and implementation of an LPA combining LLMs with planning capabilities and external tools for autonomous query processing.

Result: The LPA effectively supports FA tasks, demonstrating operational reliability.

Conclusion: The LPA successfully integrates AI into FA workflows, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### [9] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for constructing natural language state representations for LLM agents in multi-agent games, showing that summarized history, regret info, and limited action details improve alignment with game theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of systematic state representation methods for LLM agents in games, which hinders comparability and obscures behavioral impacts.

Method: Propose a framework categorizing state representation along action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style. Tested in a dynamic selfish routing game.

Result: Summarized history, regret-based rewards, and limited action info lead to behavior closer to game theory equilibrium and more stable play.

Conclusion: State representation significantly impacts LLM agent behavior, with specific methods improving alignment with theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

### [10] [The AI Policy Module: Developing Computer Science Student Competency in AI Ethics and Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639)
*James Weichert,Daniel Dunlap,Mohammed Farghally,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI Policy Module for CS students to address gaps in AI ethics and policy education, showing positive results in student attitudes and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CS curricula lack preparation for AI practitioners to integrate ethical principles and policy into AI development, necessitating educational interventions.

Method: Developed and piloted an AI Policy Module, including a technical assignment on AI regulation, and evaluated student attitudes via pre- and post-module surveys.

Result: Students reported increased concern about AI ethics and greater confidence in discussing AI regulation after the module.

Conclusion: The AI Policy Module effectively bridges the gap in AI policy education, with the AI Regulation Assignment being a key tool for engaging students.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

### [11] [Exploring and Exploiting the Inherent Efficiency within Large Reasoning Models for Self-Guided Efficiency Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15647)
*Weixiang Zhao,Jiahe Guo,Yang Deng,Xingyu Sui,Yulin Hu,Yanyan Zhao,Wanxiang Che,Bing Qin,Tat-Seng Chua,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiency in large reasoning models (LRMs) due to overthinking and proposes two methods to enhance efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often generate verbose and redundant content, increasing inference costs and reducing efficiency. The study aims to uncover and exploit the models' inherent capacity for concise reasoning.

Method: Two methods are introduced: Efficiency Steering (a training-free activation technique) and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL (a reinforcement learning framework). Both aim to balance brevity and accuracy.

Result: Experiments on seven LRM backbones show significant reduction in reasoning length while maintaining or improving task performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LRMs' intrinsic capabilities can be leveraged to improve reasoning efficiency through self-guided methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

### [12] [SwarmAgentic: Towards Fully Automated Agentic System Generation via Swarm Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15672)
*Yao Zhang,Chenyang Lin,Shijie Tang,Haokun Chen,Shijie Zhou,Yunpu Ma,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmAgentic is a fully automated framework for generating and optimizing agentic systems, outperforming baselines by 261.8% on tasks like TravelPlanner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack full autonomy, limiting adaptability and scalability. SwarmAgentic aims to bridge this gap by enabling from-scratch agent generation and self-optimization.

Method: SwarmAgentic uses language-driven exploration and evolves candidate systems via feedback-guided updates, inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving a +261.8% improvement on TravelPlanner, demonstrating effectiveness in unconstrained tasks.

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic advances scalable, autonomous agentic system design by combining swarm intelligence with automated multi-agent generation.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

*Yining Hong,Rui Sun,Bingxuan Li,Xingcheng Yao,Maxine Wu,Alexander Chien,Da Yin,Ying Nian Wu,Zhecan James Wang,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a paradigm integrating physical and digital intelligence for tasks like cooking and navigation, along with a benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are siloed, limiting their ability to solve tasks requiring integrated physical and digital intelligence.

Method: Developed a unified simulation platform (Embodied Web Agents task environments) and benchmark for tasks like cooking and navigation.

Result: Revealed performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI and humans, highlighting challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for cross-domain AI intelligence, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

*Burcu Sayin,Ipek Baris Schlicht,Ngoc Vo Hong,Sara Allievi,Jacopo Staiano,Pasquale Minervini,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedSyn is a hybrid human-AI framework for clinical decision-making, enabling interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs to refine diagnoses and treatments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making is complex and influenced by biases and incomplete information. Current LLM usage lacks interaction depth, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes MedSyn, a framework for multi-step, interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs, allowing dynamic exchanges and challenge of suggestions.

Result: Open-source LLMs show promise as physician assistants in simulated interactions.

Conclusion: Future work will validate MedSyn's effectiveness in real physician interactions for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

### [15] [Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781)
*Corentin Delacour,M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb,Joao P. Hespanha,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 2D parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) is introduced to improve mixing in constrained Ising problems by interpolating penalty strengths, eliminating the need for manual tuning and achieving faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of soft constraints in Ising machines hinders practical implementations, either slowing mixing or failing to enforce feasibility.

Method: Extends parallel tempering (PT) by adding a second dimension of replicas that interpolate penalty strengths, ensuring constraint satisfaction in final replicas.

Result: 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing (KL divergence decays as O(1/t)) and significant speedup over conventional PT in graph sparsification and Wishart instances.

Conclusion: 2D-PT broadly improves constrained Ising problem solving and is compatible with existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

*Joseph Geraci,Bessi Qorri,Christian Cumbaa,Mike Tsay,Paul Leonczyk,Luca Pani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two AI approaches: DeepSeek-V3, a large-scale generalist LLM, and NetraAI, a specialized framework for clinical data. NetraAI combines dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient subgroups, aided by an LLM Strategist for meta-evolutionary guidance. Case studies show significant improvements in classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between large-scale generalist AI models and specialized, interpretable frameworks for clinical applications, focusing on stability and explainability.

Method: NetraAI integrates contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify stable patient subgroups. An LLM Strategist acts as a meta-evolutionary layer to guide discovery.

Result: NetraAI transformed weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers in case studies (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer) using few features.

Conclusion: NetraAI represents a new generation of adaptive, explainable AI for clinical discovery, aligning with emerging paradigms like JEPA.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

*Mohamed Masry,Mohamed Amen,Mohamed Elzyat,Mohamed Hamed,Norhan Magdy,Maram Khaled*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ETS, a framework integrating EEG and eye-tracking data for open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of decoding natural language from EEG in open-vocabulary scenarios, where noise and variability hinder performance.

Method: ETS integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data for text generation and sentiment classification.

Result: Superior performance in BLEU/Rouge scores for EEG-to-text and 10% F1 score improvement in sentiment classification.

Conclusion: ETS shows potential for high-performance open-vocabulary EEG-to-text systems across diverse subjects and data sources.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

### [18] [Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14784)
*Emre Yilmaz,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transfer learning method using ConvNet is proposed to predict onflow parameters (angle of attack and speed) from surface pressure data, addressing challenges of sensor faults and data distribution changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional direct measurements of onflow parameters face challenges like sensor faults. Data-driven models need real-time learning for practical applications like wind tunnel monitoring.

Method: Train a ConvNet offline, freeze most weights, and retrain select layers for transfer learning. Demonstrated with CFD data for domain and task adaptation.

Result: Successful adaptation to changing data distributions, domain extension, and task updates, but less effective with noisy data.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for adapting to dynamic conditions but struggles with noisy data.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

### [19] [PIPE: Physics-Informed Position Encoding for Alignment of Satellite Images and Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14786)
*Haobo Li,Eunseo Jung,Zixin Chen,Zhaowei Wang,Yueya Wang,Huamin Qu,Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIPE, a physics-informed positional encoding method, enhances multimodal time series forecasting by embedding physical data into vision language models, improving accuracy by 12% in typhoon intensity forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches neglect visual data in time series, missing critical physical information like geospatial context in satellite imagery.

Method: PIPE introduces physics-informed positional indexing and variant-frequency positional encoding to embed physical and sequential order information.

Result: PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior methods.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively bridges the gap in utilizing visual data for multimodal forecasting, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

### [20] [Topology-Aware and Highly Generalizable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Retrieval in Multi-Deep Storage Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14787)
*Funing Li,Yuan Tian,Ruben Noortwyck,Jifeng Zhou,Liming Kuang,Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework using GNN and Transformer is proposed to optimize retrieval in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous items, minimizing tardiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of fast delivery services demands efficient, dense storage systems, but multi-deep AVS/RS face retrieval challenges due to lane blockages. Current homogeneous storage strategies limit flexibility.

Method: A graph-based state representation captures system topology and item attributes. A neural network combines GNN for local item embeddings and Transformer for global priority assignments.

Result: The framework outperforms heuristic methods, effectively minimizing retrieval tardiness and generalizing to diverse storage layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances retrieval efficiency in multi-deep storage systems, offering adaptability and superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

TL;DR: AZT1D is a new dataset addressing the lack of detailed T1D patient data, offering comprehensive metrics like CGM, insulin delivery, and carbohydrate intake for AI/ML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, publicly available T1D datasets limits advancements in personalized therapy and glucose prediction.

Method: AZT1D collects data from 25 T1D patients on AID systems, including CGM, insulin pump data, carbohydrate intake, and device modes over 6-8 weeks.

Result: The dataset provides rare granular details on bolus insulin delivery, supporting diverse AI/ML applications.

Conclusion: AZT1D fills a critical gap, enabling improved clinical decision-making and individualized T1D care.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [22] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) to address recurring concept drift in time series by retaining and reusing learned knowledge, improving prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift causes forgetting of past patterns, reducing prediction accuracy. Existing methods update parameters but fail to retain or reuse knowledge effectively.

Method: CEP stores forecasters for different concepts, retrieves the nearest forecaster for a test sample, and evolves new models for emerging concepts while clearing outdated knowledge.

Result: CEP effectively retains knowledge of different concepts and significantly improves prediction accuracy in recurring concept drift scenarios.

Conclusion: CEP is a robust solution for handling recurring concept drift, enhancing prediction performance by retaining and utilizing past knowledge.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding dropout at inference time improves zero-shot protein property prediction without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance zero-shot prediction performance of Protein Language Models (PLMs) like ESM2 without additional training.

Method: Inject a dropout layer (0.1 rate) between the PLM's embedding and transformer layers during inference, averaging outputs like Monte-Carlo dropout.

Result: Improved zero-shot performance on ProteinGym dataset, even without prior dropout training.

Conclusion: Dropout at inference boosts PLM performance without retraining, suggesting a simple, effective enhancement.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Assembly-of-Experts' (AoE), a method to efficiently create capable child models from Mixture-of-Experts parents by interpolating weights, reducing costs and maintaining functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of pretraining large language models (LLMs) motivates the development of AoE to leverage existing models more efficiently.

Method: AoE interpolates individual weight tensors of parent models to create child variants, enabling gradual or sharp trait changes without fine-tuning.

Result: The method produces functional child models, like the DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera', which achieves parent-level intelligence with fewer tokens and faster speed.

Conclusion: AoE offers a cost-effective way to explore model variants, demonstrating that child models can inherit and enhance parent traits without additional training.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the tradeoff between structured and selective internal representations in intelligent systems, deriving universal limits on generalization and identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental constraints on how models balance generalization and input identity preservation.

Method: Theoretical analysis of representational similarity decay with finite semantic resolution, extended to noisy and heterogeneous spaces, and validated with minimal ReLU networks and complex models like CNNs and vision-language models.

Result: Closed-form expressions reveal a universal Pareto front for generalization and identification, predicting a sharp collapse in multi-input capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for generalization. Empirical results align with theory.

Conclusion: Finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental constraint, shaping representational capacity in both deep networks and biological systems.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

Motivation: To improve time series forecasting by addressing computational inefficiency and lack of interpretability in Transformer models.

Method: Integrates semantic-aware embeddings (from pretrained language models) and spline-based temporal encoding (KAN) within a selective state-space framework (Mamba).

Result: Achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba is a versatile, efficient alternative to Transformer-based models for time-series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continuous-time approximation for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, explicitly accounting for discretization error, and applies it to study implicit regularization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete optimization methods and their continuous-time approximations by focusing on discretization error, providing new theoretical tools.

Method: Designs a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation with counter terms to explicitly control discretization error.

Result: A continuous-time model for the HB method with controlled discretization error, applied to study implicit regularization in deep learning.

Conclusion: The work offers theoretical insights and tools for analyzing momentum methods, supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the sensitivity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to prompt variations, introducing PARC, a framework for analyzing this sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs integrate visual and language modalities but inherit prompt sensitivity from LLMs. Understanding this sensitivity is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: PARC evaluates prompt sensitivity using plausible variations, a novel reliability score, and calibration for cross-dataset analysis.

Result: VLMs show language-like prompt sensitivity, with InternVL2 models being the most robust. Training data may influence sensitivity.

Conclusion: PARC provides insights into VLM prompt sensitivity, highlighting robust models and linking sensitivity to training data.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Motivation: Traditional models struggle with frequent zero-demand periods, impacting inventory management.

Method: Proposes a Model-Router framework using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers to assign forecasting strategies based on demand patterns.

Result: InceptionTime router improves accuracy by 11.8% (NWRMSLE) and speeds up inference by 4.67x on the Favorita dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enhances forecasting precision, reducing stockouts and excess inventory, highlighting adaptive AI's role in supply chain optimization.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning while maintaining scalability and plasticity.

Method: Introduces a modular neural network where modules selectively combine previous policies with internal policies, enabling linear parameter growth with task count.

Result: Outperforms alternatives in benchmark tests, showing better knowledge transfer and performance in continuous control and visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively balances scalability, plasticity, and performance in continual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that
naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual
reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective
combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating
the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed

sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

Method: TRAINCHECK automatically infers invariants for DL training and uses them to detect errors proactively.

Result: It detected 18 out of 20 real-world silent errors in one iteration and found 6 unknown bugs in training libraries.

Conclusion: TRAINCHECK effectively addresses silent training errors with high detection accuracy.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models is a complex process, making it prone to
silent errors that are challenging to detect and diagnose. This paper presents
TRAINCHECK, a framework that takes a proactive checking approach to address
silent training errors. TRAINCHECK automatically infers invariants tailored for
DL training. It uses these invariants to proactively detect silent errors
during the training process while providing debugging help. To evaluate
TRAINCHECK, we reproduce 20 real-world silent training errors with diverse root
causes. TRAINCHECK successfully detects 18 errors within a single training
iteration. It also uncovers 6 unknown bugs in popular training libraries that
lead to silent errors.

### [32] [Predicting Anthropometric Body Composition Variables Using 3D Optical Imaging and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14815)
*Gyaneshwar Agrahari,Kiran Bist,Monika Pandey,Jacob Kapita,Zachary James,Jackson Knox,Steven Heymsfield,Sophia Ramirez,Peter Wolenski,Nadejda Drenska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model to predict body composition variables (ALM, BFP, BMD) using 3D optical images, achieving competitive errors compared to supervised methods like SVR, especially in data-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA scans for body composition measurement are costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for an alternative using 3D optical images and machine learning.

Method: A semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model was applied to biomarkers from 3D optical images, alongside supervised methods like SVR, tested on a dataset of 847 patients.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model achieved errors of ~13% (ALM), ~10% (BMD), and ~20% (BFP) with 10% training data, while SVR yielded ~8% (ALM, BMD) and ~11% (BFP) with 80% data.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian model is promising for healthcare applications in data-limited scenarios, offering a viable alternative to DXA scans.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

*Sunil Kumar,Bowen Zhao,Leo Dirac,Paulina Varshavskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smaller-scale VLMs trained with GRPO and external tools (like zoom) improve detailed visual reasoning, outperforming baselines on VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning under limited compute.

Method: Train smaller models using GRPO, a simple reward structure, tool-calling interface, extra tokens for tool results, and data favoring hard visual examples.

Result: Better performance on VQA tasks due to detailed visual info from tools.

Conclusion: GRPO and tool integration enhance VLMs' visual reasoning efficiently.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

*Yao Zhang,Hewei Gao,Haokun Chen,Weiguo Li,Yunpu Ma,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano is a federated learning framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that centralizes the LLM on the server and uses lightweight NanoEdge modules for client adaptation, reducing storage and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face deployment challenges due to distributed data and privacy constraints. Federated Learning (FL) is promising but struggles with MLLMs' size and resource demands.

Method: FedNano centralizes the LLM on the server and introduces NanoEdge, a lightweight module with modality-specific encoders, connectors, and low-rank NanoAdapters, minimizing client-side storage and communication.

Result: FedNano reduces client storage by 95% and communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters, outperforming prior FL methods while handling data heterogeneity and privacy.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: The study evaluates four surrogate models for predicting material properties in high-entropy alloys, finding Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) with ML-based priors most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate HEA discovery by integrating computational and experimental data using surrogate models.

Method: Systematic comparison of cGP, DGP, encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost on hybrid datasets.

Result: DGP outperforms others in capturing correlations and uncertainty, enhancing predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Advanced surrogate models like DGP are robust tools for efficient materials design.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

*Zhizhao Wen,Ruoxin Zhang,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid BiGRU-MHA model is proposed for SSD health state prediction, combining temporal feature extraction and dynamic feature weighting to improve accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance data reliability and address the generalization bottleneck of traditional SSD health prediction models.

Method: The model integrates bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) for temporal feature extraction and multi-head attention (MHA) for dynamic feature weighting.

Result: Achieves 92.70% training and 92.44% test accuracy, with a 0.94 AUC, demonstrating strong generalization and binary classification performance.

Conclusion: The model offers a practical solution for preventive maintenance, reducing data loss risks and optimizing costs in storage systems.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

TL;DR: CACTUS, a tool for AMD stage classification, improves ML model performance by addressing data limitations, explainability, and bias, outperforming standard models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data is often incomplete or limited, hindering ML model performance and trustworthiness, especially for critical conditions like AMD.

Method: Introduced CACTUS, a tool combining genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors for AMD classification, ensuring explainability and flexibility.

Result: CACTUS outperforms standard ML models, identifies key features, and provides confidence in results, aligning with medical knowledge.

Conclusion: CACTUS enhances decision-making in AMD diagnosis by addressing data and transparency issues, offering a reliable tool for clinicians.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GRKneg for OC-SVM, improving kernel with negative samples without labels. Outperforms standard OC-SVM and binary SVM with few negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address small-scale one-class classification with limited negative samples, enhancing OC-SVM performance.

Method: Introduces GRKneg, improving OC-SVM kernel using negative samples without label optimization. Compares with standard OC-SVM and binary SVM.

Result: GRKneg outperforms standard OC-SVM with RBF kernel and binary SVM with few negative samples.

Conclusion: GRKneg is effective for one-class classification with limited negative samples, outperforming alternatives in such scenarios.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

### [39] [Event-Driven Online Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14911)
*Ganyu Wang,Boyu Wang,Bin Gu,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an event-driven online Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) framework to address asynchronous data streaming challenges, incorporating dynamic local regret for stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning in VFL faces challenges due to asynchronous data streaming and non-intersecting feature sets among clients, which prior research overlooked.

Method: Proposed an event-driven online VFL framework where only a subset of clients are activated per event, and incorporated dynamic local regret for non-convex models in non-stationary environments.

Result: The framework outperformed existing online VFL methods in stability under non-stationary data and reduced communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: The event-driven approach with dynamic local regret effectively addresses online VFL challenges, offering practical benefits in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

*Ganyu Wang,Jinjie Fang,Maxwell J. Ying,Bin Gu,Xi Chen,Boyu Wang,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOne framework optimizes query efficiency in federated black-box discrete prompt learning by activating one client per round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous federated black-box prompt tuning ignored query costs of cloud-based LLMs.

Method: Proposed FedOne framework, activating one client per round for optimal query efficiency.

Result: Numerical experiments confirmed significant improvement in query efficiency.

Conclusion: FedOne effectively enhances query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning algorithms (KNN, K-Means, SVM) to automatically define the threshold for anomaly detection in Autoencoders, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoencoders lack standardized thresholds for anomaly detection, impacting performance. Automating this threshold definition can enhance detection accuracy.

Method: Evaluated three machine learning algorithms (KNN, K-Means, SVM) to automatically set the reconstruction error threshold in Autoencoders.

Result: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using these algorithms to improve anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: Automating threshold definition in Autoencoders with machine learning can address data imbalance issues and enhance detection efficiency.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and characterizes channels in neural network loss landscapes where loss decreases slowly, weights diverge to infinity, and neurons form gated linear units. These channels resemble flat minima but reveal deeper computational insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of loss landscapes in neural networks, particularly quasi-flat regions and their impact on optimization and model behavior.

Method: Analyzes gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation of channels where weights diverge and neurons form gated linear units. Uses gradient flow solvers, SGD, and ADAM in regression settings.

Result: Identifies channels to infinity as asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced critical points. Shows these regions are often mistaken for flat minima but reveal gated linear units at convergence.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed understanding of quasi-flat regions in loss landscapes, highlighting the emergence of gated linear units and their computational implications in fully connected layers.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains and expand understanding beyond math and code.

Method: Developed Guru, a corpus of 92K verifiable examples across six domains, with domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering. Evaluated RL's impact on pretrained models.

Result: RL's effectiveness varies by domain; in-domain training is crucial for less pretrained domains. Guru-7B and Guru-32B outperform baselines by 7.9% and 6.7%.

Conclusion: RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in less pretrained domains, and Guru models advance state-of-the-art performance in general reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) to improve error estimation of ML models in unseen test domains by focusing on non-overlapping regions, outperforming prior DIS² methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate error estimation in unseen test domains is crucial for safe ML systems, but prior methods like DIS² compete in overlapping regions, limiting reliability.

Method: Proposes ODD, which maximizes disagreement only in non-overlapping target domains using domain-classifiers to estimate overlap, avoiding competition in overlapping regions.

Result: ODD-based bounds outperform DIS² in predicting target performance, validated across multiple benchmarks with improved accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: ODD provides a more reliable and accurate error estimation method for ML models under distribution shifts, addressing limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper predicts MS disability progression using sparse clinical data and digital Floodlight data, showing improved performance with multimodal transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of MS disability progression is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. The study aims to leverage digital and clinical data for better prognostics.

Method: Used tabular and time-series foundation models, a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods on baseline clinical and 12-week digital data.

Result: Integration of digital data improved prediction performance. A transformer model with unimodal embeddings performed best, but multimodal transformers consistently outperformed unimodal ones.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal approaches for accurate prognostics in MS and other complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing system performance in multi-agent settings with limited information about arm rewards.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-MAB framework effectively balances fairness and performance, with both offline and online algorithms demonstrating strong results.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

### [47] [Stable CDE Autoencoders with Acuity Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Sepsis Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15019)
*Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stable CDE state representations improve RL for sepsis treatment by addressing training instability and enforcing acuity-aware features, leading to superior policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the overlooked challenge of training instability in sequential representations for sepsis treatment RL, which degrades policy performance.

Method: Uses Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) with early stopping/stabilization and acuity-aware regularization (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS) to learn stable state representations.

Result: Stable CDE representations correlate with clinical scores and enable high-performance RL policies (WIS return > 0.9), while unstable training fails (WIS return ~ 0).

Conclusion: Training stability is critical for CDEs in clinical RL; stable representations capture meaningful patterns and improve policy outcomes.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim,Sumiran Singh Thakur,Su Min Park,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT-GO improves supervised fine-tuning by grouping tokens based on importance and optimizing with a weighted loss, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT methods treat all tokens uniformly, ignoring critical task-specific information in subsets of tokens.

Method: SFT-GO groups tokens by importance, using a weighted combination of worst-group loss and cross-entropy loss.

Result: Models with SFT-GO outperform baselines across benchmarks, datasets, and base models.

Conclusion: SFT-GO is robust and effective, improving learning dynamics and performance in LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

TL;DR: SPG introduces a lightweight online hyperparameter optimization method using sequential policy gradient modeling, outperforming conventional methods with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reinforcement learning for hyperparameter optimization is time and computationally expensive, limiting widespread use.

Method: SPG extends the base model with temporary modules to generate state-action trajectories in a single forward pass, enabling efficient hyperparameter optimization.

Result: SPG improves model performance by +0.2∼7% across diverse datasets (ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, SUPERB) with low computational costs.

Conclusion: SPG is a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional hyperparameter optimization methods, demonstrating consistent performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiPreNets, a progressive framework for training high-precision neural networks by refining residuals and optimizing loss functions and data sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training highly accurate neural networks is challenging due to non-convex optimization and hyperparameter tuning, with traditional methods often neglecting critical L∞ error.

Method: The approach refines staged training by sequentially learning prediction residuals using additional networks, optimizing loss functions, parameters, and adaptive data sampling.

Result: The framework is validated through benchmark problems, demonstrating improved accuracy.

Conclusion: HiPreNets effectively addresses training challenges and enhances neural network precision by focusing on residuals and adaptive techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents, revealing high hallucination rates under scene-task inconsistencies and offering insights for improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent and triggers of hallucinations in LLMs when used in embodied agents, especially in long-horizon tasks with scene-task inconsistencies.

Method: Constructed a hallucination probing set from an existing benchmark, evaluated 12 models across two simulation environments, and analyzed their responses to infeasible tasks.

Result: Models showed reasoning but failed to resolve inconsistencies, with hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations in handling infeasible tasks and provides actionable insights for developing more reliable planning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model for robust traffic data imputation by combining low-rank tensor algebra and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in traffic systems hinders reliable modeling, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: NCPF integrates CP decomposition into neural networks with learnable embeddings and hierarchical feature fusion.

Result: NCPF outperforms six baselines on six urban traffic datasets.

Conclusion: NCPF unifies interpretable factor analysis with neural networks, supporting advanced transportation systems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

TL;DR: This paper surveys machine unlearning verification methods, proposing a taxonomy and analyzing their strengths, limitations, and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of unified taxonomy and systematic evaluation for verifying machine unlearning operations.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing techniques into behavioral and parametric verification, analyzing assumptions and vulnerabilities.

Result: Identifies gaps and open problems in verification research, aiming to improve robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Calls for more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

*Bing Liu,Chengcheng Zhao,Li Chai,Peng Cheng,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ImprovDML, a decentralized DML framework that balances high model accuracy, privacy preservation, and Byzantine resilience using resilient vector consensus and Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between Byzantine resilience, privacy, and model accuracy in distributed machine learning.

Method: Uses resilient vector consensus for aggregation and multivariate Gaussian noise for privacy, with convergence guarantees and error bounds.

Result: Achieves tighter error bounds and better privacy-accuracy trade-off than existing methods.

Conclusion: ImprovDML effectively combines resilience, privacy, and accuracy, validated by simulations.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

TL;DR: SKIL introduces a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework to infer interpretable skill sets and parameterize policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills, outperforming traditional discrete models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify animal behavior by imposing discrete syllables, failing to reflect the dynamic recombination of motor primitives.

Method: SKIL leverages representation learning on transition probabilities to infer latent basis functions (skills) and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills.

Result: The method identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving policies, and generates realistic trajectories, validated on grid worlds, labyrinths, and animal videos.

Conclusion: SKIL provides a principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ML techniques for solving the 1D Poisson equation, emphasizing quantitative accuracy and generalization under finite data. It identifies critical factors like function space and provides theoretical and empirical bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously assess ML's accuracy in scientific applications, particularly differential equations, by quantifying generalization and convergence rates.

Method: Analyzes training dynamics, derives optimal parameters, and tests generalization for white-box and black-box models (e.g., deep linear models, neural networks).

Result: Generalization to the true equation is not guaranteed; different models show opposing behaviors. Green's function representations are extracted from black-box models.

Conclusion: Proposes a new cross-validation technique for generalization in physical systems, suggesting the Poisson equation as a benchmark for future methods.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method combining Kronecker-product factorization, SVD-driven initialization, and dynamic rank selection to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of full fine-tuning and limitations of existing PEFT methods (e.g., latency, suboptimal convergence, fixed ranks).

Method: Uses Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) for compact factorization and adaptive rank selection based on energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance with 0.99M parameters (25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA), faster convergence, and stable gradients on tasks like GSM8K, MATH, and MBPP.

Conclusion: SoKA is a robust and efficient PEFT method for large-scale model adaptation, balancing parameter efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of federated learning against Byzantine behavior, revealing a tradeoff between averaging and validity conditions. It provides theoretical bounds on centroid approximation and introduces a new algorithm with tight bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether federated learning is resilient to Byzantine faults and to understand the tradeoff between averaging and validity conditions in distributed computing.

Method: The study uses theoretical analysis to derive lower and upper bounds on centroid approximation under validity conditions. It also introduces a new algorithm for convex validity and validates findings empirically in federated learning settings.

Result: The paper establishes a lower bound of min{(n-t)/t, √d} and an upper bound of 2min{n, √d} for centroid approximation. A new algorithm achieves a √(2d)-approximation under convex validity, proving tightness of existing bounds.

Conclusion: Federated learning's robustness to Byzantine behavior is limited by tradeoffs between averaging and validity. Theoretical bounds and a new algorithm provide insights, with empirical validation supporting the findings.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

*Bihe Zhao,Pratyush Maini,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate synthetic data for Dataset Inference (DI) to detect unauthorized use of training datasets, overcoming the need for in-distribution held-out data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DI methods require in-distribution held-out data, which is rarely available, limiting their practicality. The paper aims to address this by synthetically generating such data.

Method: The approach involves (1) training a data generator on a suffix-based completion task to create diverse synthetic data, and (2) post-hoc calibration to bridge likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data.

Result: Experiments show the synthetic data enables DI to detect original training sets with high confidence and low false positives.

Conclusion: The method empowers copyright owners to verify data usage and is reliable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM is a geo-computational framework for optimizing EV charging infrastructure, balancing urban, suburban, and rural needs with scalable, data-rich methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable infrastructure planning tools to address the diverse requirements of metropolitan, suburban, and rural areas for EV charging.

Method: Uses a hierarchical H3 grid, graph neural network centrality, Voronoi tessellation, and M/M/c queue modeling to optimize charger placement and sizing.

Result: In Georgia, USA, it improved coverage, reduced travel distance for low-income residents, and met power constraints, remaining scalable for national use.

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM bridges academic optimization with practical infrastructure policy, demonstrating effectiveness for large-scale EV charging deployment.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

### [63] [Conditional Generative Modeling for Enhanced Credit Risk Management in Supply Chain Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15305)
*Qingkai Zhang,L. Jeff Hong,Houmin Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a credit risk management framework for 3PL-led SCF in CBEC, using generative AI (QRGMM and DeepFM) to assess risk and determine loan sizes, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financing challenges for SMEs in CBEC due to limited credit histories necessitate innovative solutions like 3PL-led SCF, which requires robust risk assessment.

Method: The framework combines QRGMM for risk estimation and DeepFM for covariate interactions, enabling flexible risk measures and loan size determination.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the model's effectiveness in credit risk assessment and loan sizing.

Conclusion: The study pioneers generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, improving SME access to capital and credit practices.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

*Jinglong Luo,Zhuo Zhang,Yehong Zhang,Shiyu Liu,Ye Dong,Xun Zhou,Hui Wang,Yue Yu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SecFwT is an MPC-based framework for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs, addressing computational overhead and inefficiency in MPC settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance is hindered by data scarcity and privacy concerns, with existing MPC methods limited to inference.

Method: SecFwT introduces forward-only tuning to avoid backward/optimizer computations and uses MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to replace softmax attention.

Result: SecFwT significantly improves efficiency and privacy, enabling scalable and secure LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SecFwT provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

*Júlia Vilalta-Mor,Alexis Molina,Laura Ortega Varga,Isaac Filella-Merce,Victor Guallar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A structured active learning method integrates Seq2Seq VAE to optimize multi-target drug design, demonstrated with pan-inhibitors for coronaviruses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sparse rewards and conflicting constraints in multi-target drug discovery.

Method: Combines Seq2Seq VAE with iterative loops balancing diversity, quality, and affinity, using strategic chemical filters.

Result: Generated diverse pan-inhibitor candidates for three coronavirus proteases, improving exploration of chemical space.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable approach for navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

*Yingcong Li,Xiangyu Chang,Muti Kara,Xiaofeng Liu,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) works with missing or incorrect labels, showing that multilayer transformers outperform single-layer models by leveraging unlabeled data through implicit polynomial estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ICL remains effective despite imperfect labels and to theoretically analyze how different model architectures handle unlabeled data.

Method: Theoretical study using binary Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and partially observed labels, comparing one-layer linear attention models with multilayer/looped transformers.

Result: Multilayer transformers implicitly construct polynomial estimators, with performance improving exponentially with depth, outperforming single-layer models.

Conclusion: Looping or deepening transformers enhances semi-supervised learning, validated by improved performance on real-world tabular datasets.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to predict abnormal lab test values using a set translation approach, improving prediction accuracy by up to 8% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early diagnosis by predicting abnormal values of unprescribed tests based on performed tests, leveraging the ubiquity of clinical lab results.

Method: Formulates tabular data as a set translation problem, using GPT-like embeddings for labels and values, handling missing values without estimation.

Result: Achieves up to 8% AUC improvement for predicting high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges LLM and tabular data, enhancing clinical lab result predictions.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

*Naoki Matsumura,Yuta Yoshimoto,Yuto Iwasaki,Meguru Yamazaki,Yasufumi Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework for neural network potentials (NNPs) avoids fine-tuning the teacher model, enabling better exploration of high-energy structures and reducing DFT calculations by 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods for NNPs increase energy barriers, limiting the generation of high-energy structures needed for stable MD simulations.

Method: Proposes a two-stage training: first, train the student NNP with data from a non-fine-tuned teacher; then fine-tune with a small DFT dataset.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties for organic and inorganic materials while reducing DFT calculations by 10x.

Conclusion: The framework offers a more efficient and accurate approach for NNP training, particularly for material-specific models.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

*A. S. Stankevich,I. B. Petrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI²SB) framework to improve deep learning-based Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) by addressing limitations of diffusion models, such as iterative sampling and output control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of diffusion models in FWI, particularly the unclear integration of approximate velocity models and the stochastic nature of sampling.

Method: Extends the Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I²SB) to conditional sampling (cI²SB) for interpolating between ground truth and smoothed velocity models, leveraging observed seismic signals.

Result: The proposed cI²SB framework outperforms existing conditional diffusion models, achieving higher sample fidelity with fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs).

Conclusion: The cI²SB framework is a promising solution for improving FWI by efficiently integrating prior knowledge and observed data, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

*Terrance Liu,Matteo Boglioni,Yiwei Fu,Shengyuan Hu,Pratiksha Thaker,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve one-run DP auditing in black-box settings using stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) with quantile regression, achieving tighter bounds while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-run DP auditing methods in black-box settings show a gap between empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging stronger MIA techniques.

Method: The approach incorporates quantile regression for MIA to enhance one-run auditing in black-box settings, evaluated on DP-SGD-trained CIFAR-10 image classification models.

Result: The proposed method achieves tighter empirical lower bounds on privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Using stronger MIA techniques like quantile regression improves one-run DP auditing in black-box settings, closing the gap between empirical and theoretical bounds.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

TL;DR: DiTMC adapts Diffusion Transformers for molecular conformer generation, addressing challenges like integrating graph data with 3D geometry and handling symmetries, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to molecular conformer generation, overcoming challenges like combining discrete graph info with continuous geometry and managing Euclidean symmetries.

Method: DiTMC uses a modular architecture separating 3D coordinate processing from atomic connectivity conditioning, with graph-based strategies and varied attention mechanisms (non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant).

Result: DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity on benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL).

Conclusion: Architectural choices and symmetry priors significantly impact sample quality and efficiency, offering promising directions for large-scale molecular structure modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

*Damin Kühn,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for learning ground metrics in optimal transport to improve comparisons of probability distributions, addressing limitations of predefined and supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predefined metrics lack adaptability to data structure, while supervised methods often fail to generalize across classes or handle distributions with shared supports.

Method: The approach learns a global ground metric using only class labels on a distribution-level, enabling accurate optimal transport distances.

Result: The method enhances performance in embedding, clustering, and classification tasks, validated on scRNA-seq data across multiple diseases.

Conclusion: The proposed metric learning framework offers interpretability and effectiveness for comparing arbitrary distributions in a shared metric space.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for exploration using diffusion models, leveraging entropy maximization and density estimation without explicit uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of using generative models for exploration in real-world decision-making, like scientific discovery, without relying on uncertainty quantification.

Method: Proposes a framework based on entropy maximization over a diffusion model's data manifold, using density estimation and mirror descent for scalable exploration.

Result: Develops an algorithm that converges to the optimal exploratory diffusion model, validated on synthetic and text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for scalable exploration in high-dimensional spaces using pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses minimizing disease extinction time in an SIS model with an unknown graph, proposing a learning algorithm for graph recovery and efficient vaccination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SIS model is widely used for disease spread, but prior work assumes known graphs, which is impractical. This work tackles the challenge of unknown graphs and observed infection states.

Method: The approach splits into graph learning (using a novel inclusion-exclusion algorithm) and vaccination strategy (optimal SRM algorithm for bounded treewidth graphs and a greedy heuristic for general graphs).

Result: The learning algorithm's sample complexity is established, and the SRM algorithm runs in polynomial time for bounded treewidth graphs. Experiments validate the methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the unknown graph scenario, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for Explainable AI (XAI) by proposing a unified framework (VXAI) through a systematic literature review, categorizing metrics and providing a structured overview.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of black-box AI models like Deep Neural Networks undermines trustworthiness, necessitating rigorous evaluation of XAI explanations.

Method: A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 362 publications and aggregating metrics into 41 groups, with a three-dimensional categorization scheme.

Result: The VXAI framework offers a comprehensive, structured overview of XAI evaluation metrics, enhancing comparability and systematic selection.

Conclusion: The framework supports future XAI research by standardizing evaluation, improving transparency, and fostering trust in AI systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and categorize reward modeling techniques in deep RL, addressing the lack of a comprehensive survey in current literature.

Method: Categorizes reward modeling approaches by source, mechanism, and learning paradigm, and reviews evaluation methods.

Result: Provides a structured overview of established and emerging reward modeling techniques.

Conclusion: Highlights promising research directions and fills the gap in systematic reviews of reward models in RL.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework for identifying and scoring polysemantic features in neural networks, improving interpretability by capturing multiple concepts per feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature description methods are limited by assumptions of monosemanticity and lack robustness, restricting their ability to fully explain model behavior.

Method: PRISM provides nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features, unlike single-description approaches.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in accuracy and faithfulness, enhancing description quality and polysemanticity capture.

Conclusion: PRISM advances automated interpretability by better reflecting the complexity of neural network features.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

### [78] [Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15446)
*Scott Jeen,Tom Bewley,Jonathan M. Cullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memory-based architectures improve zero-shot RL performance under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot RL assumes Markov states, but real-world applications often involve partial observability. This work investigates performance degradation and solutions.

Method: Memory-based architectures are introduced to address partial observability in zero-shot RL. Evaluated in domains with partially observed states, rewards, and dynamics.

Result: Memory-based methods outperform memory-free baselines in partially observable settings.

Conclusion: Memory-based architectures effectively mitigate performance degradation in zero-shot RL under partial observability.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoX, a training-free method to enhance LLM safety by extrapolating low-rank subspaces, reducing attack success rates by 11-54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of aligned LLMs to safety breaches during fine-tuning, even with benign data.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) to robustify safety-critical subspaces in LLM parameters.

Result: LoX reduces attack success rates significantly (11-54%) and moves parameters to a flatter, less sensitive zone.

Conclusion: LoX effectively improves LLM safety robustness without compromising adaptability, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

### [80] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHO introduces adaptive homophily learning for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods by capturing diverse homophily patterns in normal nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume uniform homophily in normal nodes, which fails in real-world datasets where homophily varies. RHO addresses this limitation.

Method: RHO uses adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA) to learn and align homophily patterns from labeled normal nodes.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show RHO effectively learns diverse homophily and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RHO robustly learns varying homophily patterns, improving anomaly detection in graphs with diverse normal node behaviors.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

### [81] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)
*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule automates rule extraction from human feedback for RLHF, improving model performance and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual rule engineering in RLHF is inefficient; AutoRule aims to automate this process for better scalability and performance.

Method: AutoRule uses a reasoning model to interpret preferences, extracts candidate rules, and synthesizes them into a unified set. It then verifies rules with language models and integrates them as auxiliary rewards.

Result: AutoRule improves win rates by 28.6% on AlpacaEval2.0 and gains 6.1% on MT-Bench, with reduced reward hacking and alignment with dataset preferences.

Conclusion: AutoRule effectively automates rule extraction, enhancing RLHF performance and capturing unique dataset qualities.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

*Simiao Lin,Wannes Meert,Pieter Robberechts,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel technique simplifies warping paths to highlight and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, amplitude differences) in time series comparisons, improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing elastic distance measures lack qualitative comparison, and traditional visualizations fail to show broader structural relationships between subsequences.

Method: Proposes a method to simplify warping paths, quantifying and visualizing key transformations like shifts and compressions.

Result: The technique provides a clearer representation of subsequence matches, enhancing interpretability in time series comparison.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses limitations of traditional visualizations, improving understanding of time series relationships.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

*Artur André Oliveira,Mateus Espadoto,Roberto Hirata Jr.,Roberto M. Cesar Jr.,Alex C. Telea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A user-guided projection framework using MLLMs enables customizable, interpretable DR for image/text data via natural-language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR techniques lack the ability to explore semantic structures not explicitly in data dimensions.

Method: Zero-shot classification with MLLMs allows dynamic, natural-language-guided projections.

Result: Enhances cluster separation and makes DR interactive and user-driven.

Conclusion: Bridges automated DR and human-centered exploration, offering adaptable projections.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

### [84] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs often produce dense latents, which are meaningful and functional in language models, not just training artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the persistence and roles of dense latents in SAEs, challenging the view that they are undesirable artifacts.

Method: Systematic study of dense latents' geometry, function, and origin, including ablation experiments and a taxonomy of their types.

Result: Dense latents form antipodal pairs, serve functional roles (e.g., position tracking, semantic features), and evolve across model layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents are intrinsic to language models and serve computational purposes, not mere noise.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

*Mohammadreza Nemati,Zhipeng Huang,Kevin S. Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIT-LVM, a method for estimating coefficients of interaction terms in linear predictors by assuming a low-dimensional structure, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear predictors with interaction terms are common but can overfit in high-dimensional settings. The paper aims to improve coefficient estimation by leveraging low-dimensional latent representations.

Method: LIT-LVM represents features with low-dimensional latent vectors, acting as structured regularization. It compares performance against elastic net and factorization machines.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines, especially with many interaction terms relative to sample size, and provides interpretable latent representations.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM is effective for high-dimensional settings, offering better accuracy and interpretability for interaction terms in linear predictors.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Mario Fritz,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a certification framework to ensure pixel-level robustness in post-hoc attribution methods for deep learning predictions, addressing their vulnerability to input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc attribution methods are non-robust to small input perturbations, undermining their trustworthiness. The paper aims to provide rigorous robustness guarantees for these methods.

Method: The framework uses randomized smoothing to sparsify and smooth attribution maps, reformulating the task as a segmentation problem to certify pixel importance against perturbations. Three evaluation metrics are proposed.

Result: Evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows the certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables reliable use of attribution methods in downstream tasks by ensuring robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

TL;DR: The paper formalizes spatiotemporal over-squashing in STGNNs, showing its unique challenges compared to static GNNs, and reveals counterintuitive behavior in convolutional STGNNs favoring distant temporal information. It also proves that common processing paradigms are equally affected, offering insights for efficient designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored issue of over-squashing in STGNNs, where temporal dimensions amplify the problem, and to understand its distinct characteristics compared to static GNNs.

Method: Formalizes the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem, analyzes its impact on convolutional STGNNs, and evaluates architectures following time-and-space or time-then-space paradigms.

Result: Convolutional STGNNs favor information from temporally distant points, and common processing paradigms are equally affected by over-squashing.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical insights into spatiotemporal over-squashing, guiding more effective STGNN designs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePCS is a lightweight, model-agnostic method to detect if RAG systems rely on memorized data rather than retrieved context, using KL divergence between two inference paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs bypassing retrieved evidence and producing contaminated outputs in RAG systems.

Method: RePCS compares the output distributions of a parametric path (query-only) and a retrieval-augmented path (query + context) using KL divergence.

Result: Achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918 on Prompt-WNQA, outperforming prior methods by 6.5%, with minimal latency overhead.

Conclusion: RePCS provides a black-box safeguard to verify meaningful retrieval use in RAG systems, crucial for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: Simplified analysis of SGD in linear regression using basic linear algebra, matching prior results without complex PSD matrix manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the analysis of SGD in overparameterized models more accessible and facilitate further research on mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Method: Uses simple linear algebra tools to derive bias and variance bounds for SGD, avoiding complex operator manipulations.

Result: Recovers the same bounds as prior work, proving the effectiveness of the simplified approach.

Conclusion: The simplified analysis enhances accessibility and paves the way for improved training methods in realistic models.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional input-output observations in learning general recursive functions by incorporating computational complexity constraints and additional observation types.

Method: Introduces Time-Bound Observations and Policy-Trajectory Observations, and builds a formal framework for learning from computational agents.

Result: Shows that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions, but computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets are impossible for linear-time computable functions.

Conclusion: The study reveals connections to finite-state transducer inference and highlights the challenges in learning under computational constraints.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing the root causes of degraded performance in scaled deep reinforcement learning networks.

Method: Empirical analyses to identify issues, followed by proposing and testing simple interventions to stabilize gradient flow.

Result: The interventions enable robust performance across varying network depths and widths, validated on multiple agents and environments.

Conclusion: Simple, compatible interventions effectively address scaling challenges, improving performance in deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in Wi-Fi fingerprinting due to device heterogeneity and temporal variations, leading to poor generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes DAILOC, using a multi-level variational autoencoder for disentanglement and memory-guided class latent alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DAILOC effectively addresses domain shifts and catastrophic forgetting, significantly improving localization accuracy.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogNet is a logic gate-based framework that improves interpretability and performance of DL-based indoor localization, addressing temporal variations and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL models for indoor localization lack interpretability, making it hard to understand and adapt to temporal variations and noise.

Method: LogNet uses logic gates to transparently identify influential access points and diagnose model failures caused by environmental noise.

Result: LogNet reduces localization error (1.1x-2.8x), model size (3.4x-43.3x), and latency (1.5x-3.6x) compared to prior DL models.

Conclusion: LogNet enhances DL-based indoor localization by providing interpretability and long-term reliability.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

TL;DR: A compositional approach using expert models achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural networks' efficiency and sustainability by mimicking human compositional reasoning.

Method: Ensembling zero-shot expert models and testing on a benchmark for compositionality.

Conclusion: The Expert Composition method is effective for efficient and sustainable AI.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning
process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such
property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more
efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by
ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci is a self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that uses coding theory and neural modules for efficient mesh smoothing, achieving 2.4x speedup and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of real-time mesh smoothing by overcoming the limitations of classical Ricci-flow solvers (costly global updates) and greedy heuristics (slow convergence or brittle tuning).

Method: Combines a greedy syndrome-decoding step (O(E) time) with two tiny neural modules for adaptive vertex and step-size selection.

Result: Reduces iteration counts by 2.4x, tightens curvature spread, and achieves high UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation (r = -0.93) with minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: MicroRicci is efficient, adaptive, and high-quality, making it ideal for real-time applications in graphics and simulation.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage in DP training by privatizing gradients after projection, using random Gaussian matrices, and applying projection during backpropagation, achieving comparable utility to DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like DP-Adam have high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability.

Method: DP-GRAPE privatizes gradients after projection, replaces SVD-based subspaces with random Gaussian matrices, and applies projection during backpropagation.

Result: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% for Vision Transformers and 70% for RoBERTa-Large, with similar performance to DP-Adam, and scales to models like OPT (6.7B parameters).

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE offers a memory-efficient DP training method without sacrificing accuracy or training time, making it scalable for large models.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

*Modar Sulaiman,Kallol Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFLC, a method to correct biased labels in ML datasets while ensuring fairness, improving both performance and fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unfair outcomes in ML due to biased training data, which affects model fairness and performance.

Method: GFLC combines prediction confidence, graph-based regularization (Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians), and demographic parity incentives.

Result: GFLC significantly improves the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GFLC effectively corrects label noise while maintaining fairness, enhancing trust in ML systems.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) is effective for BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients, outperforming single-site models and showing strong associations with clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in training robust BrainAGE models while maintaining accuracy, and to explore associations with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.

Method: Used FLAIR images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 centers, comparing centralized learning, FL, and single-site learning. Evaluated associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes using logistic regression.

Result: FL outperformed single-site models, with BrainAGE significantly higher in diabetic patients and strongly associated with post-stroke recovery.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate BrainAGE predictions without data centralization, highlighting its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

*Ranting Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses over-conservatism in offline RL due to poor explorations in suboptimal data, proposing CAWR with robust loss functions and prioritized replay to improve policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL algorithms often suffer from distribution shift and over-conservative policies due to poor explorations in suboptimal data. This paper aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: The study analyzes the impact of poor explorations on policy optimization, proposing CAWR with robust loss functions and advantage-based prioritized replay to filter poor data.

Result: CAWR outperforms on the D4RL benchmark, learning superior policies from suboptimal offline data.

Conclusion: CAWR effectively reduces over-conservatism in offline RL by addressing poor explorations, enhancing policy optimization performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

TL;DR: ViLLa is a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable animal monitoring, combining visual detection, language parsing, and symbolic reasoning to answer natural language queries about animal presence, count, and location.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent and modular system for monitoring animal populations by integrating visual data and human language queries, addressing the limitations of black-box models.

Method: ViLLa integrates three components: visual detection for identifying animals and their locations, a language parser for understanding queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer for logic-based inference.

Result: The system effectively bridges visual content with structured queries, demonstrating accuracy in tasks involving animal imagery.

Conclusion: ViLLa offers a modular and interpretable approach to animal monitoring, outperforming black-box models in transparency and task-specific performance.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

TL;DR: GraphGSOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities in 3DGS methods using dual graph structures and multi-scale attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods lack semantic correlation handling and geometric constraints, leading to poor feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities.

Method: Proposes GraphGSOcc with Dual Gaussians Graph Attention (geometric and semantic graphs) and Multi-scale Graph Attention for fine and coarse-grained feature modeling.

Result: Achieves 24.10% mIoU on SurroundOcc dataset with 1.97% improvement and 13.7% GPU memory reduction (6.1 GB).

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively enhances semantic and geometric feature aggregation, improving performance and efficiency in 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for transparent and verifiable methods to detect AI-generated videos, beyond binary classification.

Method: Created DAVID-X dataset with defect-level annotations and developed DAVID-XR1, a video-language model for interpretable reasoning.

Result: Achieves strong generalization across various generators and modes, offering transparent detection.

Conclusion: Explainable detection methods like DAVID-XR1 are promising for trustworthy AI-generated video identification.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [111] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ChartIR, an iterative refinement method for improving chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by using structured instructions and a two-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on chart-to-code generation due to the complexity of translating visual elements into structured code.

Method: ChartIR uses structured instructions (description and difference) for visual understanding and decomposes the task into initial code generation and iterative refinement stages.

Result: ChartIR outperforms other methods on models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by leveraging structured instructions and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

*Lukas Schiesser,Cornelius Wolff,Sophie Haas,Simon Pukrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictSure is an ICL framework for few-shot image classification, focusing on the role of image embeddings. It outperforms existing methods on out-of-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked role of image embeddings in ICL-based FSIC pipelines to improve performance in data-scarce domains.

Method: Systematically analyzes visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies to optimize embedding models.

Result: PictSure achieves superior out-of-domain performance while maintaining in-domain task results.

Conclusion: The success of ICL-based FSIC heavily depends on embedding model pretraining, with PictSure demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size selection in CNNs, improving accuracy and reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size in CNNs is often overlooked but impacts model performance and efficiency.

Method: BKSEF integrates information theory, signal processing, and learning theory for layer-wise kernel size determination.

Result: Achieves up to 3.1% accuracy improvement and 42.8% FLOPs reduction on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: BKSEF offers practical and theoretical support for efficient CNN design, adaptable to real-world applications.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

### [114] [Efficient Retail Video Annotation: A Robust Key Frame Generation Approach for Product and Customer Interaction Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14854)
*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based approach automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, reducing manual effort and costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video annotation is time-consuming and costly; automation is needed for efficiency in retail applications like customer behavior analysis.

Method: Uses deep neural networks for discriminative feature learning and object detection tailored to retail environments.

Result: Achieves human-level accuracy, reduces annotation costs by 2x, and requires human verification for less than 5% of frames.

Conclusion: The method significantly cuts operational costs and time, proving valuable for retail applications like shopper journey analysis and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

### [115] [Peering into the Unknown: Active View Selection with Neural Uncertainty Maps for 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14856)
*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UPNet, a lightweight neural network for active view selection (AVS) in 3D reconstruction, predicting uncertainty maps to select the most informative viewpoints efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying minimal yet informative viewpoints for accurate 3D reconstruction, avoiding redundant computations and improving efficiency.

Method: UPNet predicts uncertainty maps from single images, guiding viewpoint selection by suppressing redundancy and prioritizing informative views. Neural rendering models are then trained using these selected views.

Result: The method achieves comparable accuracy with half the viewpoints, reduces computational overhead (400x speedup, 50% resource savings), and generalizes to novel object categories without retraining.

Conclusion: UPNet offers a scalable, efficient solution for AVS, balancing accuracy and computational cost, with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, enhancing alignment via Hybrid Loss, Kernelized Representations, and Divergence Selection, and presents DETONATE, a benchmark for evaluating social bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment in T2I models is critical for capturing user intent while ensuring safety and fairness. The paper extends DPO from LLMs to T2I systems to address this challenge.

Method: DPO-Kernels integrates Hybrid Loss, Kernelized Representations (RBF, Polynomial, Wavelet), and Divergence Selection (Wasserstein, R'enyi). The DETONATE benchmark evaluates alignment using 100K curated image pairs.

Result: DPO-Kernels improves alignment and robustness, demonstrated via the DETONATE benchmark and the novel Alignment Quality Index (AQI).

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends DPO to T2I models, enhancing alignment and introducing tools (DETONATE, AQI) for evaluating and improving model fairness and safety.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

*Yizhen Zhang,Yang Ding,Shuoshuo Zhang,Xinchen Zhang,Haoling Li,Zhong-zhi Li,Peijie Wang,Jie Wu,Lei Ji,Yelong Shen,Yujiu Yang,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PeRL is a reinforcement learning approach for enhancing vision-language models in multimodal reasoning, excelling in multi-image tasks while maintaining single-image performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for VLMs struggle with complex multi-image positional reasoning, prompting the need for a more generalized solution.

Method: PeRL introduces image sequence permutation for diversity and a rollout filtering mechanism for efficient policy exploitation.

Result: PeRL outperforms baselines on multi-image benchmarks and matches performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: PeRL effectively addresses the limitations of current RL approaches in multimodal reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on medical image diffusion models, outperforming existing methods by focusing on mid-frequency reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in medical imaging by improving the accuracy of MIAs on diffusion models, which struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction and inherent image difficulty.

Method: Introduces FCRE, focusing on mid-frequency reconstruction errors and excluding high/low-frequency regions, analyzing the reverse diffusion process and using structural similarity index scores for membership determination.

Result: FCRE outperforms existing MIA methods on medical image datasets.

Conclusion: The FCRE method effectively mitigates confounding factors in MIAs for medical image diffusion models, enhancing privacy risk quantification.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving jet tagging for new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider by exploring underexplored ViT architectures.

Method: Systematic evaluation of ViTs and hybrid models using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data, constructing multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits and tracks.

Result: ViT-based models, especially hybrids like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt, outperform CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The work establishes a framework for ViT applications in jet classification and provides a structured dataset for future deep learning research.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LRCN and Transformer models using RGB tactile images from GelSight for accurate compliance prediction, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection lacks portability, scalability, and accuracy, especially for robotic applications.

Method: Uses LRCN and Transformer architectures with GelSight sensor data to predict compliance metrics.

Result: Models show significant performance improvement; harder objects are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: Proposed models effectively improve compliance estimation accuracy, though challenges remain for harder objects.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

TL;DR: PALETTE is an end-to-end text spotter for historical maps, using hyper-local sampling and positional embeddings to improve text detection and recognition, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps contain valuable georeferenced text, but extraction is challenging due to lack of methods and training data. Existing approaches are limited to specific map styles.

Method: PALETTE introduces hyper-local sampling for precise feature learning and hyper-local positional embeddings for spatial interactions. It also uses SynthMap+ for synthetic training data.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA methods on historical map benchmarks, especially for long and angled text, and has processed 60,000+ maps.

Conclusion: PALETTE and SynthMap+ provide an effective solution for text extraction from historical maps, enabling large-scale processing and improved searchability.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer is a unified framework for style transfer, addressing traditional issues and enabling artist-level results. It uses semantic-based style injection, data augmentation with human feedback, and a training-free triple diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize style transfer by unifying frameworks for different tasks, improving quality, and enabling text-driven stylization and color editing.

Method: 1. Semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP. 2. Data augmentation with human feedback. 3. Training-free triple diffusion for feature manipulation.

Result: High-quality artist-level style transfer, text-driven stylization, and image color editing while preserving content.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer successfully unifies and enhances style transfer, achieving superior results and new capabilities like color editing.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions in vector quantization, addressing training instability and codebook collapse, achieving high codebook utilization and reduced quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to mismatched distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and data loss.

Method: The authors employ Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, ensuring better representation and utilization.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces quantization error, validated empirically and theoretically.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key issues in vector quantization, improving stability and performance.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

*Jiaqi Shi,Jin Xiao,Xiaoguang Hu,Boyang Song,Hao Jiang,Tianyou Chen,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Point Distribution Set Abstraction (PDSA) module to improve point cloud analysis by addressing irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gaps, enhancing computational efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aggregating local structures in point clouds suffer from irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational overhead, and noise sensitivity due to reliance on local coordinates and direct geometric structure encoding.

Method: The PDSA module leverages high-dimensional space correlations to correct feature distribution during aggregation, using a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor and a key point mechanism to optimize computational overhead. It enhances structural homogeneity and class separability.

Result: Experiments on semantic segmentation and classification tasks show significant performance improvements with fewer parameters, validating the method's generalization and effectiveness.

Conclusion: PDSA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved computational efficiency, robustness, and performance in point cloud analysis tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

*Abdur Rahman,Keerthiveena Balraj,Manojkumar Ramteke,Anurag Singh Rathore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, improves LV segmentation in noisy echocardiograms by combining Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, multi-scale fusion, and spatial coherence calibration, outperforming SOTA models with Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LV segmentation in noisy, low-contrast echocardiograms is critical for diagnostics but challenging due to ambiguous boundaries.

Method: Echo-DND uses Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, a multi-scale fusion conditioning module, and spatial coherence calibration.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.962 (CAMUS) and 0.939 (EchoNet-Dynamic), outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets a new standard for echocardiogram segmentation and shows promise for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding for visual search, addressing both retrieval and localization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on retrieval or grounding, but not both, leading to limitations in large-scale visual search.

Method: Introduces ReSeDis, a task combining retrieval and grounding, with a curated benchmark and a zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model.

Result: ReSeDis provides a realistic testbed for multimodal search, with significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: ReSeDis advances robust and scalable multimodal search by unifying retrieval and localization.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores training generalist models for retinal OCT using visual in-context learning (VICL), enabling task flexibility without task-specific development, and evaluates its potential and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized medical image models are limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and resources, while generalist models offer flexibility for practitioners to define tasks dynamically.

Method: The study trains generalist models for retinal OCT using VICL, allowing generalization across tasks based on few examples at inference time, and proposes a broad evaluation protocol for VICL in OCT.

Result: The approach is evaluated on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a baseline to highlight VICL's potential and current limitations for OCT.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the promise of VICL for OCT, releases code openly, and encourages further research and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

*Xuelin Shen,Jiayin Xu,Kangsheng Yin,Wenhan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) to protect images from exploitation by VLP models while maintaining compression functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard user privacy against advanced VLP models that can exploit publicly posted images.

Method: Introduces PSIC with a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation module and Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented optimization, integrated into existing LIC models.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in protecting images from VLP interpretation while preserving perceptual quality and compression functionality.

Conclusion: PSIC is a versatile, plug-and-play solution for privacy protection in image compression.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DM-FNet, a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network for multimodal medical image fusion, improving feature interaction and fused image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods lack detailed feature capture and cross-modal interaction, leading to suboptimal fused images.

Method: A two-stage approach: Stage I uses a diffusion process with UNet for reconstruction; Stage II inputs noisy images into a fusion network with adaptive modules.

Result: The method excels in objective metrics, preserving brightness, tracer distribution, textures, and edges in fused images.

Conclusion: DM-FNet enhances MMIF quality and information density, validated by superior performance across medical image types.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Motivation: To enhance video understanding by generating detailed and accurate natural language descriptions of videos with paired audio.

Method: Uses low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and introduces multi-round DPO (MrDPO), updating the reference model periodically and incorporating ground-truth captions for stability.

Result: Reduces captioning error rates by 28% and surpasses leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2, with 7B parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance in video captioning and competitive results in video QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR ship detection faces issues like scale variations, small vessel noise, and complex backgrounds. Existing methods lack robust feature representation and global modeling.

Method: C-AFBiFPN introduces a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module and integrates BiFormer attention into BiFPN, creating AFBiFPN for better feature fusion and global modeling.

Result: Experiments on SSDD show improved detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and better multi-scale feature handling.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN effectively enhances SAR ship detection by improving feature representation and fusion, demonstrating superior performance on SSDD.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

TL;DR: RA-NeRF improves camera pose prediction for 3D reconstruction by combining photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter, outperforming existing methods on complex trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction (NeRF, 3DGS) rely on accurate camera pose priors and struggle with complex trajectories. RA-NeRF aims to address this limitation.

Method: RA-NeRF uses NeRF with photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation for robustness, and an implicit pose filter to refine camera poses.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets, excelling in pose estimation and visual quality.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF is effective and robust for scene reconstruction under complex camera trajectories, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

TL;DR: RetroMem, a recall-augmented COD architecture, dynamically integrates historical knowledge to improve camouflage object detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack mechanisms for historical context, limiting adaptability in challenging camouflage scenes.

Method: RetroMem uses a two-stage training paradigm: a learning stage with a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) and a recall stage with dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and inference pattern reconstruction (IPR).

Result: Extensive experiments show RetroMem significantly outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: RetroMem enhances camouflage scene understanding by leveraging historical knowledge and dynamic memory.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The approaches are validated on real-world Electron Microscope images, demonstrating improved performance in DA for semiconductor applications.

Conclusion: The DBACS approach advances DA techniques, proving effective for semiconductor defect classification, reducing costs, and enhancing scalability.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the

Motivation: Existing INR-based methods underutilize internal network features and lack video-specific design, limiting performance in detail-intensive and fast-changing video content.

Method: Proposes MSNeRV with temporal windows for consistency, GoP-level grids for background, multi-scale spatial decoders, and scale-adaptive loss functions. Introduces multi-scale feature blocks for better feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms INR-based methods and surpasses VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios for compression efficiency on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets.

Conclusion: MSNeRV enhances neural video representation and compression, addressing key INR limitations and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Motivation: Accurate identification of anatomical structures in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging; AR systems with precise landmark detection can enhance surgical navigation.

Method: BCRNet includes Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE), Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI), and Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) for iterative Bezier curve adjustment.

Result: BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on L3D and P2ILF datasets, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: BCRNet effectively enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery, offering a robust solution for surgical navigation.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Motivation: To enable flexible and marker-free visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks for safety and error prevention.

Method: Combines a perception module (extracts visual data from multi-view videos) and a reasoning module (infers actions based on observed state and task knowledge).

Result: Effectively monitored assembly tasks in challenging real-world scenarios with partial/uncertain observations.

Conclusion: ViMAT offers a practical, flexible solution for industrial assembly monitoring, validated in real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although

operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ME analysis methods treat spotting and recognition separately, which is suboptimal for real-world applications. Multimodal models offer new opportunities for improved analysis.

Method: Two tasks are introduced: ME-STR (sequential spotting and recognition) and ME-VQA (visual question answering using MLLMs/LVLMs).

Result: The MEGC 2025 challenge will evaluate algorithms on these tasks, with results submitted to a leaderboard.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of integrated approaches and multimodal models for advancing ME analysis in realistic settings.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a
leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MapFM, an End-to-End model for online vectorized HD map generation in autonomous driving, leveraging foundation models and multi-task learning for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD and semantic BEV maps are crucial for autonomous driving tasks like localization and planning, but generating them accurately online is challenging.

Method: MapFM uses a foundation model for encoding camera images and integrates auxiliary prediction heads for BEV semantic segmentation to enhance feature representation and scene understanding.

Result: The model achieves higher accuracy and improved quality in vectorized HD map generation due to richer contextual supervision.

Conclusion: MapFM demonstrates the effectiveness of combining foundation models and multi-task learning for superior HD map generation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, high-definition (HD) maps and semantic maps in
bird's-eye view (BEV) are essential for accurate localization, planning, and
decision-making. This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM
for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature
representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding
camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment
and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for
semantic segmentation in the BEV representation. This multi-task learning
approach provides richer contextual supervision, leading to a more
comprehensive scene representation and ultimately resulting in higher accuracy
and improved quality of the predicted vectorized HD maps. The source code is

### [141] [OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15318)
*Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Shichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath is a novel open-set active learning method for pathology image classification, addressing inefficiencies in traditional AL by leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model and diverse sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AL methods assume closed-set scenarios, but real-world clinical data often includes Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, reducing annotation efficiency. OpenPath aims to improve this by focusing on In-Distribution (ID) samples.

Method: OpenPath uses task-specific prompts in the first query to select ID samples. Subsequent queries employ Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS), combining Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) to ensure purity and informativeness.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show OpenPath outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods, enhancing model performance due to high sample purity.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively addresses the challenges of open-set AL in pathology image classification, offering a practical solution for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountVid, a model for open-world object counting in videos, leveraging image-based counting and video segmentation. It also presents the VideoCount dataset for evaluation, showing CountVid's superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of counting unique object instances in videos, especially in crowded scenes with occlusions, is challenging and requires avoiding double counting.

Method: CountVid combines an image-based counting model with a promptable video segmentation and tracking model for automated counting.

Result: CountVid outperforms baselines on the VideoCount dataset, demonstrating accurate object counts.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses open-world object counting in videos with CountVid and provides a new dataset for future research.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-aware texture mapping method improves animal re-identification by unwarping deformable fur patterns into a canonical UV space, enhancing feature matching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing re-identification methods struggle with deformable animal fur/skin patterns due to body movement and posture changes.

Method: Proposes a geometry-aware texture mapping approach using surface normal estimation to unwarp pelage patterns into UV space, preserving geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves up to 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy on Saimaa ringed seals and leopards.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness in feature matching without requiring ground truth UV annotations, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse poses and angles.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

### [144] [When Model Knowledge meets Diffusion Model: Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis with Alignment of Domain and Class](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15381)
*Yujin Kim,Hyunsoo Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDIS introduces a diffusion-assisted method for data-free image synthesis, leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model and domain alignment guidance to improve synthetic image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source pre-trained models lose utility without original training data, and existing DFIS methods produce samples deviating from the true data distribution.

Method: DDIS uses a diffusion model as an image prior, introduces Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG), and optimizes a Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding.

Result: DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods, generating samples that better align with the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance.

Conclusion: DDIS effectively addresses the limitations of DFIS by leveraging diffusion models and alignment techniques, enhancing synthetic image quality.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

*Anju Chhetri,Jari Korhonen,Prashnna Gyawali,Binod Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NERO, a novel OOD scoring mechanism for deep learning in medical imaging, improving reliability by leveraging neuron-level relevance and clustering for better OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliability in medical imaging is critical, as diagnostic decisions depend on model outputs. Current OOD detection methods may not fully capture OOD diversity, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: NERO clusters neuron-level relevance for in-distribution classes to form centroids and uses a relevance distance metric to quantify sample deviation. It also incorporates scaled relevance in the bias term and combines feature norms for refined performance.

Result: NERO outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision), demonstrating improved separability and reliability.

Conclusion: NERO provides an effective and explainable OOD detection framework, enhancing reliability in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: Medical report generation from imaging data is challenging, and integrating LLMs with medical imaging requires deeper exploration.

Method: MRG-LLM combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces dynamic prompt customization via conditional affine transformations. Two implementations are proposed: prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenHOI is a two-stage framework for 4D human-object interaction synthesis, addressing generalization to unseen objects and high-fidelity sequence generation using sparse 3D keyframes and a contact-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets hinders progress in text-driven human motion synthesis, prompting the need for a method that generalizes to unseen objects and produces high-quality 4D HOI sequences.

Method: GenHOI uses an Object-AnchorNet for sparse 3D HOI keyframe reconstruction and a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) for interpolating keyframes into dense 4D sequences, enhanced by contact-aware encoding and attention mechanisms.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen objects and high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: GenHOI effectively addresses the challenges of 4D HOI synthesis, offering a scalable solution with robust generalization and high-quality output.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI

TL;DR: CLAIM is a framework for generating and segmenting realistic myocardial scars in LGE cardiac MRI using clinical knowledge and diffusion models, improving segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited and variable LGE images with high-quality scar labels hinder robust segmentation model development.

Method: CLAIM uses the SMILE module (clinical knowledge-guided scar mask generation) and a joint training strategy for scar synthesis and segmentation.

Result: CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scars and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions than baselines.

Conclusion: CLAIM enables controllable, realistic scar synthesis and improves downstream medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

*Xingrui Qin,Wentao Zhao,Chuan Cao,Yihe Niu,Houcheng Jiang,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet eliminates dense LiDAR supervision for radar-based depth estimation, using sparse LiDAR to achieve comparable results with 1% supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense LiDAR supervision is costly and data-intensive; sparse supervision is more practical.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates sparse radar points to create depth priors, guiding monocular depth prediction without dense labels.

Result: Outperforms dense-supervised methods, reducing RMSE by ~35% and preserving fine details.

Conclusion: RaCalNet offers a cost-effective, high-performance alternative to dense-supervised depth estimation.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

TL;DR: WinWinLay improves Layout-to-Image generation by addressing imprecise localization and artifacts in pre-trained diffusion models, using Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts despite leveraging pre-trained models.

Method: Proposes Non-local Attention Energy Function to redistribute attention scores and Adaptive Update (Langevin dynamics-based) to maintain domain fidelity.

Result: WinWinLay outperforms state-of-the-art methods in control precision and visual realism.

Conclusion: WinWinLay effectively enhances layout adherence and realism in generated images.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,}
Show-o2, that leverage autoregressive modeling and flow matching. Built upon a
3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are
constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling
scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective
multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model,
autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language
head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and
image/video generation. A two-stage training recipe is designed to effectively
learn and scale to larger models. The resulting Show-o2 models demonstrate
versatility in handling a wide range of multimodal understanding and generation
tasks across diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos. Code and

*Junhao Wu,Aboagye-Ntow Stephen,Chuyuan Wang,Gang Chen,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised framework for ultra-high-resolution land cover classification, using SAM2 knowledge and a FreqWeaver Adapter, achieves better results with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability in ultra-high-resolution land cover classification.

Method: Parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m imagery, leveraging SAM2 and a FreqWeaver Adapter.

Result: 1.78% improvement over parameter-efficient tuning and 3.44% gain over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for fine-grained land cover analysis with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

### [155] [A Unified Graph-based Framework for Scalable 3D Tree Reconstruction and Non-Destructive Biomass Estimation from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15577)
*Di Wang,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel graph-based framework for end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction improves AGB estimation, reducing reliance on high-quality TLS data and enabling scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QSM methods for AGB estimation are limited by dependency on high-quality TLS data and complex pre-processing, hindering scalability.

Method: Proposes a unified graph-based pipeline integrating tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction.

Result: Achieves ~20% error in leaf-on and ~30% error in low-density ULS datasets, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, practical solution for large-scale AGB estimation, advancing QSM applications in forestry and climate research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [156] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm for video super-resolution (Real-VSR) to balance spatial detail enhancement and temporal consistency using pre-trained generative models like stable diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using stable diffusion for Real-VSR often sacrifice spatial details for temporal coherence, leading to suboptimal results. The key challenge is maintaining degradation-robust temporal consistency while enhancing details.

Method: DLoRAL introduces a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module and two LoRA branches (Consistency-LoRA and Detail-LoRA) trained iteratively to learn temporal coherence and spatial details, respectively. The branches are merged for efficient inference.

Result: Experiments show DLoRAL achieves strong performance in accuracy and speed, delivering consistent and detail-rich video outputs.

Conclusion: DLoRAL effectively addresses the trade-off between spatial detail and temporal consistency in Real-VSR, offering a practical solution with high-quality results.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2M-Reg is a novel framework for multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) that uses mono-modal similarity, improving alignment for highly disparate modalities like PET-MRI and FA-MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DIR methods struggle with highly heterogeneous modalities due to unreliable similarity metrics, leading to distorted images.

Method: Proposes M2M-Reg, which trains DIR models using mono-modal similarity, and introduces GradCyCon for diffeomorphism. Extends to semi-supervised settings without ground-truth data.

Result: Achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods on the ADNI dataset for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg effectively handles heterogeneous multi-modal DIR, offering seamless integration and superior performance.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction-free online framework for open-vocabulary 3D object detection, leveraging pre-trained models and multi-view fusion for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, causing computational and memory issues, hindering real-time deployment.

Method: Uses Cubify Anything and CLIP for single-view detection, with an association module (3D NMS and box matching) and an optimization module (IoU-guided particle filtering) for multi-view fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets, enabling real-time perception in large environments.

Conclusion: The reconstruction-free paradigm offers efficient, real-time 3D detection with strong generalization across scenarios.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a text-driven diffusion framework for realistic human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis, balancing realism and physical correctness via Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI generation is challenging due to strict contact accuracy and diverse motion requirements. Existing methods compromise between realism and physical correctness.

Method: HOIDiNi separates the problem into object-centric (hand-object contact) and human-centric (full-body motion refinement) phases, optimizing in noise space using DNO.

Result: HOIDiNi outperforms prior works in contact accuracy, physical validity, and motion quality on the GRAB dataset, enabling complex interactions like grasping and placing.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi successfully generates realistic and controllable HOIs from text prompts, advancing the field by combining precision and naturalness.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-range embodied tasks in robotics, addressing limitations of current vision-language models in handling long-term memory and fine-grained reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with long-term memory and embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, necessitating a dedicated benchmark for scalable evaluation.

Method: A new benchmark is developed in the Habitat simulator, featuring 60 memory-intensive tasks that require sustained engagement and contextual awareness. Baselines integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with navigation policies.

Result: The benchmark enables scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning, with baselines highlighting performance gaps and areas for improvement in VLMs.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for advancing memory integration in embodied agents, emphasizing the need for improved long-term memory handling in robotics applications.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs perform better with degraded images, contrary to human perception. VQ-TTT, a lightweight adaptation module, improves accuracy by aligning images with model preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual quality affects MLLM performance and address the paradox where degraded images improve results.

Method: Introduces VQ-TTT, a module that adjusts input images dynamically using a learnable kernel and fine-tunes shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA.

Result: VQ-TTT improves accuracy across MLLMs and datasets without extra resources.

Conclusion: Adaptive visual inputs, not universally clean images, are better for MLLMs, redefining visual quality standards.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR is a two-stage inference framework for VLMs that improves efficiency and output fidelity by combining a value model with margin-based rewards, achieving faster and more reliable captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time search methods for VLMs are computationally expensive and prone to low-confidence generations, leading to persistent hallucinations.

Method: ViMaR uses a temporal-difference value model and margin-aware reward adjustment to first identify high-value captions and then refine weak segments, penalizing low-confidence continuations.

Result: ViMaR generates more reliable, accurate, and detailed captions with a 4× speedup, generalizes to unseen models, and improves self-training performance.

Conclusion: ViMaR is a scalable, transferable, and self-improving inference-time decoding strategy for VLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

TL;DR: A novel approach for image/video relighting using joint albedo estimation and relit output synthesis via video diffusion models, improving generalization and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing relighting methods, which struggle with data scarcity, error accumulation, and unrealistic outputs under complex lighting.

Method: Jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in one pass using video diffusion models, trained on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: Achieves strong generalization, better visual fidelity, and temporal consistency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances relighting by combining implicit scene understanding and realistic lighting synthesis, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation datasets are limited for world exploration due to short duration, static scenes, and lack of annotations. Sekai aims to fill this gap with diverse, annotated, and high-quality videos.

Method: The authors collect, pre-process, and annotate videos using an efficient toolbox, including details like location, weather, and camera trajectories. A subset trains YUME, an interactive exploration model.

Result: Experiments confirm the dataset's quality. YUME demonstrates the potential for interactive world exploration using Sekai.

Conclusion: Sekai advances video generation and world exploration, enabling applications like interactive experiences and motivating further research.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: ECAD uses a genetic algorithm to optimize caching schedules for diffusion models, improving speed and quality without modifying the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are slow and computationally expensive; existing caching methods are rigid and limited.

Method: Proposes ECAD, a genetic algorithm that learns efficient caching schedules for diffusion models using calibration prompts.

Result: ECAD achieves better quality (e.g., 4.47 FID improvement) and speed (2.58x speedup) compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion model inference.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from elderly patients' discharge summaries is presented, addressing underrepresented clinical NLP challenges. The dataset includes 14 AEs and contextual attributes, evaluated using FlairNLP, showing strong performance for coarse-grained tasks but challenges in fine-grained extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical NLP resources and tackle challenges like discontinuous and overlapping entities in AE extraction.

Method: A manually annotated corpus with 14 AEs and contextual attributes was created. Multiple models, including transformer-based ones like BERT-cased, were evaluated across three annotation granularities using FlairNLP.

Result: Transformer models performed well on coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943) but struggled with fine-grained tasks (F1 = 0.675), especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level performance, challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and nuanced clinical language. The dataset serves as a benchmark for future AE extraction research.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted

### [167] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing low-quality output during constrained decoding in autoregressive models by leveraging complementary errors from constrained and unconstrained predictions.

Method: BoostCD uses two-phase decoding: Phase 1 generates weak predictions (constrained and unconstrained), and Phase 2 combines them via a learned boosted model.

Result: BoostCD, applied to closed information extraction (BoostIE), outperforms prior methods in and out of distribution, reducing common errors.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively improves structured output quality by exploiting complementary errors, demonstrating superior performance in tasks like information extraction.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [168] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst is a weakly supervised framework for assessing context document credibility in LLMs, improving accuracy and F1 scores without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore varying credibility of context documents, risking unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement for automated credibility estimation and integrates it into LLM inference via black-box and white-box strategies.

Result: CrEst outperforms baselines, achieving up to 26.86% accuracy and 3.49% F1 score improvements, even under high noise.

Conclusion: CrEst effectively enhances LLM performance by addressing context credibility, demonstrating robustness across models and datasets.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [169] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench is a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on multi-document reasoning, created via synthetic generation to address the lack of benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multi-document reasoning are scarce due to annotation costs, despite its relevance to LLMs.

Method: MDBench uses a synthetic generation process with LLM-assisted edits on structured seed knowledge to create document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench challenges current LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short documents, and enables targeted analysis.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique is adaptable for future challenges and model improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [170] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores LLMs for diabetes prediction using few-shot prompting, comparing six LLMs and traditional ML models. Proprietary LLMs outperform open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B leading in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored use of LLMs for structured numerical data in diabetes prediction, comparing their performance with traditional ML models.

Method: Empirical analysis using PIDD, evaluating six LLMs (four open-source, two proprietary) and three ML models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) outperform open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving top accuracy. Gemma-2-27B also beats traditional ML models in F1-score.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for medical predictions, but challenges like prompting strategy variation and domain-specific fine-tuning remain. Future work should focus on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that reversible sentence embeddings can be generated for LLMs without altering model weights, enabling exact text reconstruction using a special memory token.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of LLMs to reconstruct original text from embeddings without weight modifications, highlighting potential applications in retrieval, compression, and controlled generation.

Method: Introducing a memory token with an optimized embedding, trained on fixed sequences, and evaluating across English/Spanish datasets and model scales (100M to 8B parameters).

Result: Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences (up to ~240 tokens), showcasing the phenomenon's robustness.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a novel LLM capability, suggesting practical uses in memory-based tasks and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, finding higher odds among men, LGBTQ+ individuals, and divorced persons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured data on social isolation and loneliness in suicide reports by leveraging NLP techniques.

Method: Topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to analyze NVDRS narratives.

Result: High-quality classifiers (F1: .86, accuracy: .82) identified 1,198 cases of chronic social isolation, with higher odds for men, gay individuals, and divorced persons.

Conclusion: The method enhances surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in suicide cases.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT is a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation, addressing gaps in coherence, style, and relevance, and outperforming traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating long-form generation often miss key aspects like coherence and style or are biased by pretraining data, making evaluation challenging.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on diverse long-form response datasets with Likert-rated quality, providing semantic reward feedback for GRPO training.

Result: PrefBERT outperforms traditional metrics, aligns well with human preferences, and improves policy model responses.

Conclusion: PrefBERT is a reliable and effective solution for evaluating and improving open-ended long-form generation.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [174] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the effectiveness of unlearning in large language models (LLMs), finding that paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning and that unlearning from text chunks is difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to unlearn specific knowledge in LLMs for privacy, regulation, and content correction drives this study.

Method: Empirical investigation of how learning-time knowledge encoding impacts unlearning effectiveness.

Result: Paraphrased descriptions enhance unlearning, but unlearning from text chunks remains challenging.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding is crucial for reliable post-hoc unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [175] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) are proposed to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities and optimizing clarifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linguistic features like omission and idiom in dialogues introduce ambiguities, challenging discourse parsers.

Method: DCM uses clarification type and discourse goal reasoning, while CPO optimizes clarifications to reduce errors.

Result: The approach outperforms SOTA baselines on STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively resolves ambiguities and enhances dialogue discourse parsing performance.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The CKD-EHR framework improves disease prediction in EHRs by distilling knowledge from a fine-tuned large language model to a lightweight BERT model, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EHR-based disease prediction models lack sufficient medical knowledge representation and face deployment inefficiencies.

Method: The CKD-EHR framework uses knowledge distillation: fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B as a teacher model, generating soft labels via multi-granularity attention, and transferring knowledge to a BERT student model.

Result: On MIMIC-III, CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR enhances diagnosis accuracy, efficiency, and resource utilization, offering a practical solution for clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage framework for Open-domain Dialogue (OD) generation, addressing the one-to-many (o2m) property by decomposing it into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS). It introduces o2mDial, a corpus for MRG and PS, and demonstrates improved diversity and quality in smaller LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based dialogue agents ignore the one-to-many (o2m) property of OD, limiting response diversity. This work aims to explicitly model o2m to enhance diversity and coherence.

Method: Decomposes OD generation into MRG (generating diverse responses) and PS (selecting based on human preference). Introduces o2mDial corpus and new in-context learning, instruction-tuning, and evaluation strategies.

Result: Empirical results show up to 90% improvement in response quality and diversity, bringing smaller LLMs closer to larger models' performance.

Conclusion: The two-stage framework effectively models o2m in OD, improving diversity and coherence in smaller LLMs, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok is a Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility by 10% without performance loss, using rule-based pre-tokenization and a branching entropy-based algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility (number of tokens) while maintaining model performance.

Method: Uses rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structure, a seed vocabulary of linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Reduces fertility by 10%, improving inference speed by 10%, with no performance drop in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach is effective for creating efficient tokenizers.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memory mechanisms in state-space language models, revealing primacy and recency effects through structured recall tasks in the Mamba architecture. It identifies three key mechanisms: long-term memory via sparse channels, short-term memory via delta-modulated recurrence, and dynamic memory allocation based on semantic regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models, using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools.

Method: Structured recall tasks applied to the Mamba architecture, with targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale models (1.4B and 7B parameters).

Result: A U-shaped accuracy profile (strong performance at sequence start and end) is observed, driven by three mechanisms: sparse channels for long-term memory, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and semantic regularity modulating memory allocation.

Conclusion: The study uncovers distinct memory mechanisms in state-space models, highlighting the roles of sparse encoding, recurrence, and semantic context in shaping memory retention and forgetting.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for SDG-related text classification, finding that optimized smaller models can match larger ones like GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking SDG progress is challenging due to data complexity; LLMs offer potential solutions.

Method: Analyzed proprietary and open-source LLMs for SDG text classification, testing Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: Smaller models with prompt engineering perform as well as larger models like GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller LLMs are viable for SDG text classification, reducing reliance on large models.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning enhances LLMs' reasoning by using abstract prototypes, improving performance across tasks like logic, planning, and math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve cross-domain generalization in LRMs by leveraging shared abstract reasoning prototypes.

Method: Proposes ProtoReasoning: automated prototype construction, verification via Prolog/PDDL, and scalable problem synthesis.

Result: Achieves 4.7% (logic), 6.3% (planning), 4.0% (general reasoning), and 1.0% (math) improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Prototype-based learning enhances generalization, validating shared reasoning structures as foundational for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

TL;DR: MinosEval is a new method for evaluating open-ended QA, distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions and using tailored strategies for each, outperforming traditional metrics and aligning better with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for open-ended QA lack interpretability and fail to differentiate between factoid and non-factoid questions, leading to inaccurate assessments of LLM capabilities.

Method: MinosEval classifies questions into factoid and non-factoid types, applying adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid ones.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human annotations and provides more interpretable results compared to traditional metrics.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses key limitations in open-ended QA evaluation, offering a more refined and interpretable approach for assessing LLM performance.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates language technologies' ability to understand Basque and Spanish varieties using NLI, revealing performance drops due to linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well current language technologies handle linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish.

Method: Uses NLI as a pivot task with a manually-curated parallel dataset, testing encoder-only and decoder-based LLMs.

Result: Performance declines with linguistic variation, particularly in Basque, due to the variation itself, not lexical overlap. Encoder-only models struggle most with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation poses challenges for language models, especially in non-standard dialects like Western Basque. Data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph RAG, a framework combining knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation to improve historical text analysis, reducing manual effort and enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in large language models for historical text analysis, particularly in computational humanities and AIGC technology.

Method: Proposes Graph RAG, integrating chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation.

Result: The domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieves F1=0.68 in relation extraction. GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% on open-domain datasets, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, benefiting historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness in large-scale question answering over web corpora.

Method: Hybrid retrieval (sparse + dense indices), K-Means clustering, cluster-specific prompts for LLM, and multi-stage answer synthesis.

Result: Ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation improve large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thunder-DeID, a framework for de-identifying court judgments in South Korea, addressing legal and technical challenges with a DNN-based pipeline and a new PII categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current de-identification methods for court judgments in South Korea are inadequate for large-scale use and lack clear legal-technical alignment.

Method: Proposes Thunder-DeID: (i) creates a Korean legal dataset with annotations, (ii) introduces systematic PII categorization, and (iii) develops a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively balances open justice and data protection, offering a scalable, legally compliant solution.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM applications in clinical trial recruitment, focusing on trial-patient matching, critiques current benchmarks, and explores challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for clinical trial recruitment due to their ability to handle natural language and consolidate knowledge, but adoption is limited by proprietary models and weak evaluations.

Method: The survey analyzes trial-patient matching, contextualizes LLM-based approaches, and critically examines benchmarks, methods, and evaluation frameworks.

Result: The paper identifies gaps in current LLM applications, such as reliance on proprietary models and inadequate benchmarks, and highlights challenges in clinical research adoption.

Conclusion: The survey underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical trial recruitment but calls for better benchmarks, open models, and further research to address adoption barriers.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to improve language identification (LID) for low-resource languages, addressing class imbalance and bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages perform poorly in LID due to limited, single-domain data (e.g., the Bible). Class imbalance and bias are key challenges.

Method: Novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages.

Result: Improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The SCL approach effectively enhances LID models for low-resource languages by mitigating domain bias.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeVisE evaluates LLMs in clinical decision support, revealing differences in reasoning between zero-shot and fine-tuned models, with demographic biases noted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack distinction between genuine medical reasoning and superficial patterns, necessitating a framework like DeVisE.

Method: DeVisE uses ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, with real-world and synthetic counterfactuals, to test LLMs' sensitivity and reasoning.

Result: Zero-shot models show coherent reasoning, while fine-tuned models are stable but less responsive to clinical changes, with demographic biases.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE is crucial for safer, more transparent clinical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SANSKRITI is a benchmark dataset for evaluating language models' understanding of India's cultural diversity, revealing gaps in their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tools for assessing language models' comprehension of local socio-cultural contexts, particularly India's diverse culture.

Method: Created SANSKRITI, a dataset with 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 cultural attributes across India's 28 states and 8 union territories.

Result: Evaluation showed significant disparities in models' ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many struggling in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving cultural understanding in language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSMMIC introduces a multimodal, multilingual dataset for Indian languages, integrating articles, images, and user comments to enhance summarization and headline generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research and resources in Indian languages for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization.

Method: The study uses COSMMIC, a dataset with article-image pairs and reader comments, and evaluates four configurations for summarization using models like LLama3 and GPT-4, along with comment and image classifiers.

Result: The dataset and approach enable effective summarization by leveraging user insights and multimodal data, outperforming text-only methods.

Conclusion: COSMMIC bridges gaps in Indian language NLP research by integrating text, images, and user feedback, fostering inclusivity and advancing the field.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning method to improve lexical alignment in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Swahili for LLMs, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in LRLs due to data scarcity and poor cross-lingual alignment, which TLI aims to address.

Method: TLI uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune early-layer embeddings in Swahili-centric LLMs.

Result: TLI boosts lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs by 28%, with improvements generalizing to unseen pairs.

Conclusion: TLI is a parameter-efficient strategy to enhance cross-lingual knowledge in LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fine-grained evaluation framework and the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) to address hallucinations in MLLMs for GUI agents, proposing Context-Aware Cropping to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents suffer from hallucinations (systematic localization errors), compromising reliability.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained evaluation framework, introduces PSS for uncertainty quantification, and develops Context-Aware Cropping for input refinement.

Result: The framework and methods reveal nuanced failure modes, enhance interpretability, and improve robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions provide actionable insights and improve the reliability of MLLMs in GUI interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems struggle with architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees as task complexity and agent numbers grow.

Method: The framework introduces (1) a parallel architecture for task decomposition, (2) an adaptive collaboration engine for dynamic LLM selection, and (3) optimization strategies for efficient problem-solving.

Result: AgentGroupChat-V2 outperforms baselines with 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K, 30.4% on AIME, and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval, showing greater improvements in harder tasks.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers an efficient, general-purpose solution for LLM multi-agent systems, excelling in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE is a framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning hierarchy, revealing reliance on statistical recall rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether LLMs' high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks stems from true reasoning or statistical recall of training data.

Method: Introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework with an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different reasoning levels (associations, interventions, counterfactuals).

Result: Performance drops when LLMs face problem variations, indicating reliance on memorization.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE highlights LLMs' limitations in true reasoning, encouraging further research to improve hierarchical reasoning skills.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: CINGS is a post-training supervision method that improves grounding in LLMs by training with relevant context prepended to responses, masking the context during loss computation. It enhances grounding in text and visual domains without degrading downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods of appending context at inference time fail to ensure grounded generation in LLMs, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: CINGS trains models by prepending relevant context to responses and computing loss only over response tokens, masking the context.

Result: CINGS outperforms other methods in 11 text datasets, reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks, and maintains factual consistency without performance degradation.

Conclusion: CINGS effectively shifts model behavior to rely more on external context, improving grounding across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [198] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for hyperbole and metaphor detection, leveraging bidirectional dynamic interaction and emotion analysis to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbole and metaphor detection is challenging due to semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, with existing methods neglecting emotion and domain associations.

Method: EmoBi integrates emotion analysis, domain mapping, and bidirectional dynamic interaction, with a verification mechanism for accuracy.

Result: EmoBi achieves significant F1 score improvements (28.1% for hyperbole, 23.1% for metaphor) over baselines on four datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and potential for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection in NLP.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

### [199] [Lessons from Training Grounded LLMs with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15522)
*Shang Hong Sim,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,Hai Leong Chieu,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Navonil Majumder,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning to improve grounding in LLMs, achieving better performance in answer correctness, citation quality, and refusal behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating trustworthy and grounded responses in LLMs, especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios where models often fail to cite correctly or refuse valid answers.

Method: Uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) for training with outcome-based rewards, focusing on answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality. Also employs a two-stage training setup and GPT-4 distillation.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models outperform instruction-only variants, particularly in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. Combined GRPO and GPT-4 distillation improves long-form QA tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL enhance the verifiability and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [200] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION improves local-global attention models by integrating linear attention to capture out-of-window tokens, achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoffs without compromising training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of local attention's disregard for tokens outside the window, enabling efficiency gains in short-context scenarios.

Method: Introduces RATTENTION, a local attention variant combined with linear attention to capture out-of-window tokens, tested at 3B and 12B scales.

Result: RATTENTION with a 512 window size matches full-attention performance, enhances long-context performance, and maintains training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION shifts the Pareto frontier, offering superior performance-efficiency tradeoffs in local-global attention models.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### [201] [Approximating Language Model Training Data from Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15553)
*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to approximate training data from model weights, using a gradient-based approach to select high-matching data from a public corpus, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data, creating a need to approximate data from weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach selects high-matching data from a large public text corpus, tested on classification and supervised-finetuning tasks.

Result: On AG News, performance improved from 65% to 80%; on MSMARCO, perplexity dropped from 3.3 to 2.3, nearing expert benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers useful data from model weights, enabling near-original performance without access to true training data.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PredGen reduces LLM latency in voice chat by speculatively generating responses while the user speaks, cutting delay by ~2x with minimal added cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the latency issue in LLM-based voice chat caused by slow first-sentence generation, which delays TTS audio output.

Method: Propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a framework using speculative decoding to generate candidate responses during user speech.

Result: Simulated experiments show ~2x latency reduction with minimal additional computation.

Conclusion: PredGen effectively mitigates latency in real-time voice chat applications without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

*Zhengyang Shan,Emily Ruth Diana,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) to evaluate gender fairness in LLMs, covering binary and non-binary genders, and assesses 22 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive metrics for evaluating gender inclusivity in LLMs, especially beyond binary distinctions.

Method: Developed GIFI, a multi-level evaluation metric, and tested it on 22 LLMs of varying sizes and types.

Result: Found significant variations in gender inclusivity across models, highlighting biases and the need for improvement.

Conclusion: GIFI provides a benchmark for advancing gender fairness in LLMs, emphasizing inclusivity.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

TL;DR: SciVer is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal foundation models' ability to verify scientific claims, revealing a performance gap between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve foundation models' verification skills in multimodal scientific contexts.

Method: SciVer includes 3,000 expert-annotated examples from 1,113 papers, covering four reasoning types. Performance of 21 models was evaluated.

Result: A significant performance gap exists between models and humans. RAG and error analysis highlight limitations in current models.

Conclusion: SciVer provides insights to enhance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal
scientific literature tasks.

### [205] [DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583)
*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a task for discourse-level text scene graph parsing, and proposes DiscoSG-Refiner, a method to improve parsing efficiency and accuracy over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene graph parsers fail to handle multi-sentence descriptions effectively, missing cross-sentence phenomena like coreference, leading to fragmented graphs and poor VLM task performance.

Method: The authors introduce DiscoSG-DS, a dataset for discourse-level parsing, and propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which uses two small PLMs to iteratively refine a base graph, reducing computational overhead.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by ~30% over baselines, achieves 86x faster inference than GPT-4, and enhances downstream VLM tasks like caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner offers a scalable and efficient solution for discourse-level scene graph parsing, outperforming existing methods while being computationally feasible.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WikiMixQA is a new benchmark with 1,000 MCQs for evaluating cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts from Wikipedia. It highlights challenges in long-context, multi-modal reasoning, showing proprietary models like GPT-4-o outperform open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on complex reasoning over multi-modal data in long documents, necessitating a new benchmark to evaluate and advance document understanding.

Method: The paper introduces WikiMixQA, a dataset of 1,000 MCQs derived from 4,000 Wikipedia pages, and evaluates 12 vision-language models on their ability to synthesize information from tables and charts.

Result: Proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-o) achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context but drop significantly (~50%) with long-document retrieval. Open-source models perform poorly (max 27%).

Conclusion: WikiMixQA is a vital benchmark for advancing document understanding, revealing significant gaps in long-context, multi-modal reasoning capabilities of current models.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI to automate MCQ creation in Portuguese, evaluating quality and reliability through expert review and student responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ creation is time-consuming and costly, with limited focus on non-English languages and quality assessment of AI-generated MCQs.

Method: Generative models produce Portuguese MCQs for reading comprehension, evaluated via expert review and psychometric analysis of student responses.

Result: Models generate MCQs comparable to human-authored ones but face issues with semantic clarity, answerability, and distractor quality.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for MCQ creation in Portuguese, but improvements are needed in distractor design and semantic clarity for real-world use.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies regret in LLMs, proposing methods to identify and analyze regret expressions and neurons, addressing dataset and metric gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding regret in LLMs enhances model reliability and reveals neural cognition coding.

Method: Proposes workflow for regret datasets, S-CDI for optimal layers, RDS/GIC for neuron analysis.

Result: Identified optimal regret layer (S-CDI), M-shaped decoupling pattern, and categorized neurons (RDS).

Conclusion: The methods advance regret analysis in LLMs, improving reliability and cognitive insights.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers like 'quite' and 'very' stem from both literal meanings and pragmatic factors like utterance cost, not just semantics or politeness norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether cross-cultural misunderstandings arise from literal word meanings or broader pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: Three experiments with British and American English speakers, supported by a computational cognitive model analyzing informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Differences in intensifier interpretation arise from both literal meanings and varying weights on utterance cost, not just semantics or politeness norms.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural interpretation differences involve a complex interplay between literal meanings and pragmatic factors, challenging simpler explanations.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities by measuring ordered coverage of concepts. Analysis of 36 LLMs reveals biases in concept order and low diversity, with even the best model achieving only 75% ordered coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to follow specified concept orders in generative tasks, ensuring both instruction adherence and compositional generalization.

Method: Proposed Ordered CommonGen benchmark, measuring ordered coverage of concepts in generated sentences. Analyzed 36 LLMs to assess performance.

Result: LLMs show biases in concept order, leading to low-diversity outputs. The best model achieved only ~75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: Improvements are needed in LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities, as current models struggle with ordered concept generation.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate machine learning techniques for authorship attribution in Romanian texts, using the ROST corpus.

Method: Six ML techniques (SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, ANN) were tested with character n-gram features.

Result: ANN achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in some runs with 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Lightweight character n-gram approaches can rival complex methods, especially in resource-constrained or under-studied languages.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CC-Learn, a reinforcement learning framework, improves LLM reasoning consistency by training on cohorts of similar questions, outperforming baselines in accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with consistent and robust reasoning, prompting the need for methods like CC-Learn to enhance reliability.

Method: CC-Learn uses reinforcement learning with a composite objective (cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, rejection penalty) to enforce uniform reasoning patterns across similar questions.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, StrategyQA) show CC-Learn improves accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning

### [213] [Leaky Thoughts: Large Reasoning Models Are Not Private Thinkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15674)
*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning traces in large models leak sensitive data, amplified by test-time compute methods, creating a privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that reasoning traces are safe and internal, revealing their potential to leak sensitive user data.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations to analyze leakage in reasoning traces, focusing on test-time compute approaches.

Result: Increased reasoning steps amplify privacy leakage, despite making models more cautious in final answers.

Conclusion: Safety efforts must address internal reasoning traces, not just outputs, due to the privacy-utility tension.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 21 MT systems for their ability to handle gender ambiguity, finding most fail to provide gender-neutral translations, though a few use specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving gender ambiguity in MT, especially in grammatical gender languages, to avoid misgendering and representational harms.

Method: Assessed 21 MT systems across three translation directions, categorizing observed gender-neutral strategies and examining binary gender stereotypes' impact.

Result: Most systems lacked gender-neutral translations for ambiguity, but a few employed specific strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved gender-inclusive MT, noting limited success in some systems.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenRecal is a distillation framework for VLMs that addresses architectural diversity, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from large to smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large VLMs on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to high computational demands, necessitating distillation into smaller models.

Method: GenRecal uses a Recalibrator to align feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, facilitating cross-architecture knowledge transfer.

Result: GenRecal outperforms baseline and large-scale VLMs on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides a general-purpose solution for efficient VLM deployment, overcoming architectural limitations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

### [216] [PhantomHunter: Detecting Unseen Privately-Tuned LLM-Generated Text via Family-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15683)
*Yuhui Shi,Yehan Yang,Qiang Sheng,Hao Mi,Beizhe Hu,Chaoxi Xu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is a new detector for LLM-generated text, especially effective for privately-tuned models, outperforming existing methods with over 96% F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of privately-tuned LLMs has made detection of their generated text challenging, as existing detectors fail to adapt.

Method: PhantomHunter uses a family-aware learning framework to identify shared traits across base models and their derivatives, avoiding reliance on individual characteristics.

Result: Experiments show PhantomHunter outperforms 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, achieving F1 scores over 96%.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively addresses the challenge of detecting text from privately-tuned LLMs, offering superior performance.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.
