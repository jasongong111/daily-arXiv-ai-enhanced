### [1] [Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373)
*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEWI, a 3D multiplayer simulation for medical evacuation training, showing improved learning and decision-making in students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There was no medium to simulate medical evacuation networks for training and evaluation in classroom settings.

Method: Developed MEWI in Unity to model battlefield constraints, patient interactions, and operational scenarios (Pacific island assault and Eurasian conflict).

Result: MEWI participation improved medical evacuation learning and cooperative decision-making, validated by student surveys and observer notes.

Conclusion: MEWI is a significant advancement in high-fidelity medical training tools, offering insights for improving evacuation education and operations.

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

### [2] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) to simplify prompt engineering for LLMs, enabling customization and optimization, and demonstrates its effectiveness with a 4x performance improvement in a compliance agent case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt engineering frameworks are either too restrictive or inflexible, hindering sophisticated agentic programming.

Method: The authors propose PDL, a declarative language for prompt representation, allowing manual and automatic tuning while integrating LLM calls, rule-based code, and external tools.

Result: PDL improved performance by up to 4x in a compliance agent case study compared to traditional canned patterns.

Conclusion: PDL effectively addresses prompt engineering complexity, enhancing productivity and optimization potential.

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

### [3] [Jolting Technologies: Superexponential Acceleration in AI Capabilities and Implications for AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06398)
*David Orban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, suggesting superexponential AI growth, and develops tools for future empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict the accelerating growth of AI capabilities and its implications for AGI emergence.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework and validates detection methods using Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: Provides robust tools for future empirical studies and insights into AI trajectory dynamics.

Conclusion: The study lays a mathematical foundation for understanding AI growth patterns and their potential consequences, aiding research and policy.

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

### [4] [Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Q-dialectical systems are proven more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are stronger than d-dialectical systems, emphasizing counterexample and contradiction roles in belief revision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model how agents (mathematicians, communities, or automated systems) refine beliefs for consistency and truth.

Method: Analyzing and comparing three dialectical systems: d-, p-, and q-dialectical systems.

Result: Q-dialectical systems are strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are stronger than d-dialectical systems.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of counterexamples and contradictions in belief revision and reasoning processes.

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

### [5] [SCC-recursiveness in infinite argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06852)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of SCC-recursive semantics in infinite argumentation frameworks (AFs) and proposes two extensions to handle infinite settings, evaluating them against established criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC-recursive semantics fail in infinite AFs due to well-foundedness issues, prompting the need for reliable extensions.

Method: Two approaches to extend SCC-recursiveness to infinite AFs are proposed and evaluated using Baroni and Giacomin's criteria.

Result: Directionality fails in general for infinite AFs, but some proposed semantics satisfy it in finitary frameworks.

Conclusion: The work advances infinite argumentation theory and supports reasoning in unbounded or evolving domains.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

### [6] [Scaling Towards the Information Boundary of Instruction Set: InfinityInstruct-Subject Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06968)
*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a systematic framework for constructing high-quality instruction datasets to improve model performance, introducing InfinityInstruct-Subject, a dataset of ~1.5M instructions, which enhances coverage and depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction datasets lack sufficient coverage and depth, limiting model performance on complex tasks and rare domains.

Method: A framework with hierarchical labeling, seed selection, evolutionary data synthesis, and deficiency diagnosis for targeted data generation.

Result: InfinityInstruct-Subject improves instruction-following capabilities and outperforms comparable datasets in coverage and depth.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for evolving instruction datasets from quantity to quality, enhancing model generalizability.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

### [7] [The User-Centric Geo-Experience: An LLM-Powered Framework for Enhanced Planning, Navigation, and Dynamic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06993)
*Jieren Deng,Aleksandar Cvetkovic,Pak Kiu Chung,Dragomir Yankov,Chiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system with three cooperative agents to address gaps in traditional travel-planning systems, improving query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional travel-planning systems are static and fragmented, failing to handle real-world complexities like evolving conditions and disruptions, leading to poor user experience.

Method: Three agents are introduced: a Travel Planning Agent for multi-modal queries, a Destination Assistant Agent for fine-grained navigation, and a Local Discovery Agent for disruption response using image embeddings and RAG.

Result: The system shows significant improvements in query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience.

Conclusion: The proposed system holds promise for applications ranging from urban exploration to emergency response.

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

TL;DR: FR3E improves RLVR by addressing unstable exploration in LLMs through structured exploration and targeted rollouts, enhancing reasoning stability and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR struggles with unstable exploration in LLMs, limiting reasoning improvements.

Method: FR3E identifies high-uncertainty decision points and uses targeted rollouts to provide semantically grounded feedback.

Result: Empirical results show FR3E improves training stability, response coherence, and correctness on AIME24 benchmarks.

Conclusion: FR3E effectively enhances LLM reasoning by enabling robust and structured exploration.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

### [9] [Neural Network-Based Parameter Estimation for Non-Autonomous Differential Equations with Discontinuous Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06267)
*Hyeontae Jo,Krešimir Josić,Jae Kyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HADES-NN is a novel method using neural networks to approximate discontinuous signals and estimate parameters for non-autonomous differential equations, improving accuracy in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-autonomous differential equations are challenging to fit when external signals change abruptly, requiring a robust parameter estimation method.

Method: HADES-NN uses neural networks in two stages: first to smooth discontinuous signals, then to estimate model parameters.

Result: The method provides accurate parameter estimates for systems like circadian clocks and yeast mating responses.

Conclusion: HADES-NN extends the applicability of fitting models to real-world measurements with discontinuous signals.

Abstract: Non-autonomous differential equations are crucial for modeling systems
influenced by external signals, yet fitting these models to data becomes
particularly challenging when the signals change abruptly. To address this
problem, we propose a novel parameter estimation method utilizing functional
approximations with artificial neural networks. Our approach, termed Harmonic
Approximation of Discontinuous External Signals using Neural Networks
(HADES-NN), operates in two iterated stages. In the first stage, the algorithm
employs a neural network to approximate the discontinuous signal with a smooth
function. In the second stage, it uses this smooth approximate signal to
estimate model parameters. HADES-NN gives highly accurate and precise parameter
estimates across various applications, including circadian clock systems
regulated by external light inputs measured via wearable devices and the mating
response of yeast to external pheromone signals. HADES-NN greatly extends the
range of model systems that can be fit to real-world measurements.

### [10] [Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Controller for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06326)
*Harsh Ravivarapu,Gaurav Bagwe,Xiaoyong Yuan,Chunxiu Yu,Lan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEA-DBS is a sample-efficient RL framework for adaptive DBS, improving convergence, beta-band suppression, and hardware compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DBS lacks adaptability and efficiency; RL-based aDBS faces sample complexity and hardware constraints.

Method: SEA-DBS uses a predictive reward model and Gumbel Softmax for stable exploration in binary action spaces.

Result: Faster convergence, better beta-band suppression, and resilience to quantization in simulations.

Conclusion: SEA-DBS is a practical RL solution for real-time, resource-constrained aDBS.

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic
simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster
convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and
resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS
offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,
resource-constrained neuromodulation.

*M. A. Evangelista-Alvarado,P. Suárez-Serrato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SymFlux is a deep learning framework for symbolic regression of Hamiltonian functions from vector fields, using hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the discovery of Hamiltonian functions from vector fields in Hamiltonian mechanics.

Method: Uses hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures to learn and output symbolic mathematical expressions of Hamiltonians, trained on newly developed datasets.

Result: Effectively recovers symbolic expressions of Hamiltonians, demonstrating accuracy.

Conclusion: SymFlux advances automated discovery in Hamiltonian mechanics by accurately identifying Hamiltonian functions.

Abstract: We present SymFlux, a novel deep learning framework that performs symbolic
regression to identify Hamiltonian functions from their corresponding vector
fields on the standard symplectic plane. SymFlux models utilize hybrid CNN-LSTM
architectures to learn and output the symbolic mathematical expression of the
underlying Hamiltonian. Training and validation are conducted on newly
developed datasets of Hamiltonian vector fields, a key contribution of this
work. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately
recovering these symbolic expressions, advancing automated discovery in
Hamiltonian mechanics.

### [12] [DecoyDB: A Dataset for Graph Contrastive Learning in Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06366)
*Yupu Zhang,Zelin Xu,Tingsong Xiao,Gustavo Seabra,Yanjun Li,Chenglong Li,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DecoyDB, a large-scale dataset for self-supervised graph contrastive learning (GCL) to improve protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, addressing data scarcity and unique challenges in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, high-quality binding affinity labels hinders progress in drug discovery. Existing datasets like PDBbind are limited, and self-supervised learning, particularly GCL, offers a solution by leveraging unlabeled data.

Method: The authors propose DecoyDB, a dataset with ground-truth and decoy protein-ligand complexes, annotated with RMSD values. They also design a customized GCL framework for pre-training graph neural networks on DecoyDB and fine-tuning on PDBbind labels.

Result: Models pre-trained with DecoyDB show superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability in predicting binding affinity.

Conclusion: DecoyDB and the proposed GCL framework effectively address data scarcity and improve binding affinity prediction, advancing drug discovery.

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital
role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack
of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used
PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,
especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to
break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast
unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.
However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a
comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex
pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique
characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a
large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised
GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground
truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with
computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal
(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation
(RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to
pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with
labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with
DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.

### [13] [The Riemannian Geometry associated to Gradient Flows of Linear Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06367)
*El Mehdi Achour,Kathlén Kohn,Holger Rauhut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that gradient flow for learning linear convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space, regardless of initialization, unlike fully connected networks which require balanced initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of gradient flow dynamics from fully connected networks to convolutional networks, focusing on geometric properties.

Method: Analyzes the gradient flow on parameter space for linear convolutional networks, proving it can be represented as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space under certain conditions.

Result: The gradient flow for linear convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space, regardless of initialization, for $D \geq 2$ or $D=1$ with strides >1.

Conclusion: The study generalizes the Riemannian gradient flow framework to convolutional networks, highlighting differences from fully connected networks and the role of initialization in the metric.

Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear
convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown
recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written
as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight
matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition.
We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear
convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function
space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional
convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides
of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric
depends on the initialization.

### [14] [Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models for Edge AI Using Automatic Weight Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06380)
*Habibur Rahaman,Atri Chatterjee,Swarup Bhunia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WINGs dynamically generates and compresses neural network weights during inference, reducing memory usage without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory requirements of neural networks, especially for edge applications, by reducing storage needs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and lightweight SVR models to predict weights in FC networks, and sensitivity-aware compression for CNNs.

Result: Achieves 53x compression for FC layers, 28x for AlexNet with MNIST, and 18x for AlexNet with CIFAR-10, with minimal accuracy loss (1-2%).

Conclusion: WINGs significantly reduces memory usage, improving throughput and energy efficiency, making it ideal for resource-constrained edge applications.

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

### [15] [KPFlow: An Operator Perspective on Dynamic Collapse Under Gradient Descent Training of Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06381)
*James Hazelden,Laura Driscoll,Eli Shlizerman,Eric Shea-Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decomposition of gradient flow in recurrent dynamical systems into two operators (K and P), explaining latent dynamics and neural collapse, and validates findings with experiments and a Pytorch package.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations in finite, non-linear recurrent models like RNNs, Neural ODEs, and GRUs.

Method: Decomposes gradient flow into a Parameter Operator (K) and a Linearized Flow Propagator (P), analyzing their interplay in latent dynamics and multi-task training.

Result: Demonstrates how K and P explain low-dimensional latent dynamics and neural collapse, and measures task alignment in multi-task training.

Conclusion: Advances theoretical understanding of gradient descent in non-linear recurrent models, supported by experimental validation and a practical toolkit.

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

*Siddhant Deshpande,Yalemzerf Getnet,Waltenegus Dargie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates CNN, ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for detecting tampering in ECG signals and a Siamese network for identity verification, achieving high accuracy (up to 100%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting ECG signal integrity against tampering is critical due to the rise of wireless ECG systems for health monitoring and authentication.

Method: ECG signals are transformed into 2D time-frequency representations using CWT. Models are trained on data from 54 subjects performing daily activities, tested against six tampering strategies.

Result: Models achieved over 99.5% accuracy for fragmented manipulations and 98% for subtle ones. The hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model achieved 100% accuracy for identity verification.

Conclusion: The hybrid models, especially FeatCNN-TranCNN and CNN-Transformer Siamese, are highly effective for ECG tamper detection and identity verification.

Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health
monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is
becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,
ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also
evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity
verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment
substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.
The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional
representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54
subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings
while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental
results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,
FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding
99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent
from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B
substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable
performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity
verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy
of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model
delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

TL;DR: KnowRare is a deep learning framework for predicting clinical outcomes of rare ICU conditions, outperforming existing models and scoring systems by leveraging domain adaptation and a condition knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare conditions in the ICU are underserved due to data scarcity and heterogeneity. KnowRare aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses self-supervised pre-training for condition-agnostic representations and a condition knowledge graph to adapt knowledge from similar conditions.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art models and ICU scoring systems across five clinical prediction tasks.

Conclusion: KnowRare is a robust solution for improving care for rare ICU conditions, with flexibility and generalizability.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

*Niloy Sikder,Paul Zerr,Mahdad Jafarzadeh Esfahani,Martin Dresler,Matthias Krauledat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces eegFloss, a Python package with eegUsability, an ML model for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG data, improving sleep study accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals in sleep research are prone to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep staging. The paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: Developed eegUsability, an ML model trained on manually labeled EEG data from 15 participants, and integrated it into the eegFloss package.

Result: eegUsability achieved strong performance (F1-score ~0.85, Cohen's kappa 0.78) and high recall (~94%) in identifying usable EEG data.

Conclusion: eegFloss enhances sleep study precision by detecting artifacts, improving analysis reliability and outcomes.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

*Victoria R. Li,Jenny Kaufmann,Martin Wattenberg,David Alvarez-Melis,Naomi Saphra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretability tools can predict out-of-distribution (OOD) model behavior, with hierarchical attention patterns indicating hierarchical OOD generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if interpretability can predict unseen model behavior (OOD), addressing a gap in current research.

Method: Analyze attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models trained on a synthetic task.

Result: Hierarchical in-distribution attention predicts hierarchical OOD generalization, even without direct reliance on these patterns.

Conclusion: Interpretability tools show promise for predicting OOD behavior, motivating further research.

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

*Qianyu Long,Qiyuan Wang,Christos Anagnostopoulos,Daning Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPhD is a novel approach for efficiently training Diffusion Models (DMs) in Federated Learning (FL) environments, addressing data heterogeneity and high communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to train high-quality DMs in FL settings while overcoming challenges like data heterogeneity and communication inefficiency.

Method: FedPhD uses Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation, selection policy, and distributed structured pruning.

Result: FedPhD reduces communication costs by 88%, improves FID scores by 34%, and uses only 56% of resources compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedPhD is an effective solution for training DMs in FL, balancing performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for labeling neurons in protein language models (PLMs) with biological descriptions, enabling automated analysis and steering protein generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal neuron representations of PLMs and leverage them for protein design.

Method: Introduces an automated labeling framework for neurons, scales to large models, and uses neuron activation-guided steering for protein generation.

Result: Reveals neuron sensitivity to biochemical properties and structural motifs, enabling targeted protein design. Also uncovers PLM scaling laws and neuron space distribution.

Conclusion: The framework advances PLM interpretability and practical applications in protein engineering.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their
internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first
automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically
grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on
sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of
thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to
diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron
activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,
enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and
instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,
including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that
analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws
and a structured neuron space distribution.

### [22] [Energy-Efficient Supervised Learning with a Binary Stochastic Forward-Forward Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06461)
*Risi Jaiswal,Supriyo Datta,Joseph G. Makin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units to reduce energy consumption in neural network training, achieving performance close to real-valued methods with significant energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern machine learning's high energy consumption, especially in large neural networks, and the inefficiency of backpropagation for custom hardware accelerators.

Method: Derived forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units, leveraging binarization and stochasticity to enable efficient hardware execution.

Result: Performance close to real-valued forward-forward on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, with an estimated energy savings of about one order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed binary, stochastic forward-forward algorithms offer a promising alternative to backpropagation, balancing performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine
learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to
larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main
algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant
challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial
dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for
the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;
here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this
study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.
Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing
operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,
combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the
information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and
expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be
implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of
unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to
real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one
order of magnitude.

*Hanyang Peng,Shuang Qin,Yue Yu,Fangqing Jiang,Hui Wang,Wen Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Adam's success and limitations, proposing SignSoftSGD (S3) as a novel optimizer with improved stability, performance, and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam's empirical success is underexplored, and its vulnerability to loss spikes due to uncontrolled update scaling motivates the need for a more robust optimizer.

Method: S3 introduces three innovations: flexible p-th order momentum, unified exponential moving average coefficients, and an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient module.

Result: S3 achieves optimal convergence, faster training, and fewer loss spikes, even with aggressive learning rates, outperforming AdamW.

Conclusion: S3 is an effective optimizer, combining stability, efficiency, and superior performance in vision and language tasks.

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but
the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain
underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam
stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large
gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes
due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and
mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with
three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by
employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator,
departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)
preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving
stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3
minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving
average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently
bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3
incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,
accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that
S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic
optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of
vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more
rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even
with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers
performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the
training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task
performance.

*Aaron Dharna,Cong Lu,Jeff Clune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FMSP leverages foundation models to enhance self-play, overcoming local optima and fostering diverse, high-quality solutions in multi-agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-play (SP) often gets stuck in local optima and lacks diversity. FMSP aims to address these limitations by using foundation models to leap across policy spaces.

Method: FMSP introduces three variants: vFMSP for policy refinement, NSSP for diversity, and QDSP combining both. Evaluated in Car Tag and Gandalf scenarios.

Result: FMSP outperforms human-designed strategies in Car Tag and successfully jailbreaks LLM defenses in Gandalf, also patching vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: FMSP is a promising approach to improve self-play, enabling more creative and open-ended strategy discovery.

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery

*Yudan Song,Yuecen Wei,Yuhang Lu,Qingyun Sun,Minglai Shao,Li-e Wang,Chunming Hu,Xianxian Li,Xingcheng Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MimbFD, a dual-view graph representation learning method to address message imbalance in fraud detection caused by fraudsters' obfuscation and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based fraud detection methods suffer from imbalanced global topological information and node-specific information loss due to fraudsters' camouflage and class imbalance.

Method: MimbFD includes a topological message reachability module for better node representation and a local confounding debiasing module to balance class influence.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show MimbFD outperforms in fraud detection.

Conclusion: MimbFD effectively mitigates message imbalance and improves fraud detection performance.

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud
detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node
representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the
focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global
topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being
overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign
nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class
imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of
imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior
obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,
we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate
Message imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a
topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation
learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient
propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust
node representations, enhancing the stable association between node
representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.
Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the
results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud
detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDifRC introduces diffusion models into federated learning to address data heterogeneity, using text-driven contrastive learning and noise-driven regularization for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning harms model convergence and performance; diffusion models offer potential solutions.

Method: Proposes FedDifRC, leveraging diffusion representations for text-driven contrastive learning and noise-driven regularization.

Result: FedDifRC effectively mitigates data heterogeneity and improves model performance, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: FedDifRC successfully integrates diffusion models into federated learning, offering a robust solution for data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across
participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this
paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across
multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this
paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning
paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during
federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion
representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel
diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation
Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion
models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven
diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to
provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence
signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the
diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive
learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency
regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising
representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In
addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying
on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to
ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different
scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

TL;DR: MoFE-Time integrates time and frequency features using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network, achieving state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to jointly model time and frequency characteristics, limiting performance in complex time series forecasting.

Method: MoFE-Time uses a pretraining-finetuning paradigm with MoE routing to combine time and frequency domain features.

Result: Achieves 6.95% and 6.02% reductions in MSE and MAE, respectively, outperforming Time-MoE on benchmarks and a proprietary dataset.

Conclusion: MoFE-Time excels in practical applications, demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal
role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture
for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing
models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency
characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal
performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling
periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an
innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency
domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the
pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively
transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets
with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency
and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing
mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input
signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared
to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation
benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from
real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this
dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical
commercial applications.

*Yunrui Zhang,Gustavo Batista,Salil S. Kanhere*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel family of monotonic post-hoc calibration methods for deep neural networks, ensuring expressiveness, robustness, and interpretability while preserving probability rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated, overconfident predictions, and existing calibration methods lack guarantees of monotonicity, expressiveness, or interpretability.

Method: The approach uses a constrained calibration map, linearly parameterized by the number of classes, formulated as a constrained optimization problem.

Result: The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across datasets and models, outperforming existing methods in calibration while being efficient.

Conclusion: The new calibration methods provide a robust, interpretable, and effective solution for improving probability calibration in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated probability estimates,
leading to overconfident predictions. A common approach for calibration is
fitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms
predicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is
instance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability
outputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee
monotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized
calibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural
networks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose
a family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a
constrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number
of classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and
interpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability
output by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained
optimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance
across datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming
existing calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient. Our

TL;DR: AdaDPIGU is a differentially private SGD framework for deep neural networks, using importance-based gradient updates and adaptive clipping to improve performance in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy methods degrade performance in high-dimensional settings due to noise scaling with dimensionality.

Method: Proposes AdaDPIGU, which estimates parameter importance privately, prunes low-importance coordinates, and uses adaptive clipping for sparse, noise-efficient updates.

Result: Achieves 99.12% accuracy on MNIST (ε=8) and 73.21% on CIFAR-10 (ε=4), outperforming non-private baselines.

Conclusion: AdaDPIGU enhances both privacy and utility, proving adaptive sparsification's effectiveness.

Abstract: Differential privacy has been proven effective for stochastic gradient
descent; however, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in
high-dimensional settings, as the scale of injected noise increases with
dimensionality. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new
differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates
tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a
differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each
parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune
low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping
mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically,
we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy
and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported
under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test
accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching
the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at
$\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating
that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.

### [30] [Direct Regret Optimization in Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06529)
*Fengxue Zhang,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Bayesian optimization (BO) method jointly learns optimal models and non-myopic acquisitions by minimizing multi-step regret, outperforming traditional BO baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BO methods rely on hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models, often operating myopically. This paper aims to improve BO by directly targeting multi-step regret minimization.

Method: The framework uses an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying hyperparameters to simulate BO trajectories. These trajectories train an end-to-end decision transformer for selecting query points. A dense training--sparse learning paradigm is adopted.

Result: The method outperforms BO baselines, achieving lower simple regret and robust exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional BO by integrating model learning and non-myopic acquisition, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate
hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying
function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a
novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model
and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and
acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our
framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying
hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an
acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a
Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing
multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision
transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving
the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning
paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated
data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real
evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO
baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust
exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

TL;DR: CircuitGCL is a graph contrastive learning framework for AMS circuits, enhancing transferability via representation scattering and label rebalancing, outperforming SOTA methods in parasitic estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like scarce design data, unbalanced labels, and diverse circuit implementations in learning robust and transferable circuit representations.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning with hyperspherical representation scattering and balanced MSE/softmax cross-entropy losses to improve transferability and mitigate label disparities.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 33.64% ~ 44.20% R² for edge regression and 0.9× ~ 2.1× F1-score gain for node classification.

Conclusion: CircuitGCL effectively enhances transferability and robustness in parasitic estimation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is
crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the
scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the
inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to
learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these
limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning
framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to
enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs
a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through
hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale
data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax
cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution

*Shan Shen,Yibin Zhang,Hector Rodriguez Rodriguez,Wenjian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CircuitGPS is a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits, using graph representation learning and a hybrid graph Transformer to improve accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of integrated circuit design data limits deep learning for AMS circuits, necessitating a few-shot learning approach.

Method: CircuitGPS represents circuits as heterogeneous graphs, uses small-hop sampling, and employs a hybrid graph Transformer with positional encoding.

Result: Improves coupling existence accuracy by ≥20% and reduces MAE of capacitance estimation by ≥0.067 compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CircuitGPS offers scalable, accurate parasitic effect prediction and insights for graph representation learning in AMS circuits.

Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from
graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However,
training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the
scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present
CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS
circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the
coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link
prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a
small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph.
Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer.
Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that
summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph.
CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and
reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to
existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling
direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.
Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models
for representation learning.

*Tongtian Zhu,Tianyu Zhang,Mingze Wang,Zhanpeng Zhou,Can Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized learning with optimized communication scheduling, especially concentrated in later stages, improves generalization. A single global merging at the end matches server-based training performance. Low communication preserves model mergeability, and decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance hindrance of decentralized learning due to limited peer-to-peer communication and challenge the belief that it generalizes poorly under data heterogeneity.

Method: Study communication scheduling, including timing and frequency of device synchronization. Implement a single global merging at the final step.

Result: Concentrating communication in later stages improves generalization. Final global merging matches server-based training performance. Low communication preserves mergeability, and decentralized SGD converges faster.

Conclusion: Decentralized learning can generalize well under optimized communication, challenging common beliefs and offering insights into model merging and loss landscapes.

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional
parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by
limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication
should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently
devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating
communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly
improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected
communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is
sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show
that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the
\textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical
contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the
globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized
mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy
among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as
constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the
common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data
heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model
merging and neural network loss landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning-based 2-stage model using GNN and MLP predicts SRAM parasitics in pre-layout stages, reducing errors by 19X and speeding up simulations by 598X.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies between pre-layout and post-layout simulations in SRAM designs to reduce design iterations and improve efficiency.

Method: Proposes a model combining GNN classifier and MLP regressors, using Focal Loss and subcircuit information to handle class imbalance and hierarchical structure.

Result: Achieves up to 19X error reduction and 598X simulation speedup in 4 real SRAM designs.

Conclusion: The model effectively predicts parasitics pre-layout, enhancing design efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized.
The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and
post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design
parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the
parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware
pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage
model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model
combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in
SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant
internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to
abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM
designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in
parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also
significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

TL;DR: LoRAM is a magnitude-driven initialization scheme for LoRA, matching spectral methods' performance without their inefficiencies. It optimizes update magnitudes for better convergence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and storage inefficiencies of spectral initialization in LoRA while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes LoRAM, a 'Basis & Basis' initialization scheme that scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight magnitudes to simulate spectral gains.

Result: LoRAM matches or outperforms spectral initialization across benchmarks while retaining LoRA's efficiency.

Conclusion: LoRAM provides a parameter-efficient, high-performance alternative to spectral initialization for tuning large models.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning
large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence
and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra
computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we
establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and
propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that
matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions
are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove
low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying
hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as
mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization
succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed
knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the
boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization
strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight
magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM
serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while
matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

*Qian Chen,Xianhao Chen,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the storage burden of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices by optimizing expert caching under storage constraints to minimize latency. It proposes algorithms with approximation guarantees for both Top-1 and general Top-K expert selection scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sheer number of expert networks in MoE models creates storage challenges for edge devices, necessitating distributed inference and optimized caching to reduce latency.

Method: For Top-1 (K=1), a greedy algorithm with a (1 - 1/e)-approximation is used. For general K≥1, a successive greedy decomposition method and dynamic programming are employed, with an accelerated max-convolution-based algorithm for polynomial-time solutions.

Result: Simulations show the proposed method significantly reduces inference latency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The work provides efficient solutions for expert caching in distributed MoE models, improving scalability and reducing latency for edge devices.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input.
However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a
significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we
consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPPO, a framework for RLVR that leverages high-quality demonstrations and progressive optimization techniques, outperforming baselines in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RLVR by focusing on how to best use a small set of trusted demonstrations, rather than scaling data volume.

Method: Proposes prefix-guided sampling for data augmentation and learning-progress weighting for dynamic training sample adjustment.

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving faster convergence and higher performance on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: LPPO effectively leverages expert demonstrations and learning progress to enhance RLVR performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work
has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we
investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO
(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive
optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best
leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than
simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human
problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation
method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations
to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired
by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current
capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that
adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We
estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of
per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and
de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster
convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using predicted information gain to guide exploration in environments with unknown dynamics, leveraging reinforcement learning to find effective policies and improve dynamics estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit models of controllable dynamics are often unavailable, necessitating methods to learn them through exploration.

Method: Uses predicted information gain to identify informative regions for exploration and applies reinforcement learning to derive suboptimal policies.

Result: Outperforms myopic exploration approaches, providing reliable estimates of underlying dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach effectively guides exploration in unknown environments, improving dynamics learning.

Abstract: Environments with controllable dynamics are usually understood in terms of
explicit models. However, such models are not always available, but may
sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate
using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine
the most informative regions of an environment to explore next. Applying
methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies
to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable
dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic
exploration approaches.

*Burak Demirel,Yu Wang,Cristian Tatino,Pablo Soldati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generalization-focused RL framework for RAN control improves performance in diverse 5G scenarios, outperforming baselines in throughput and spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based RRM algorithms underperform in dynamic RAN environments, and RL policies often overfit to training conditions, necessitating a robust, generalizable solution.

Method: The framework uses attention-based graph representations, domain randomization, and distributed data generation with centralized training to enhance generalization.

Result: The policy achieves ~10% higher throughput and spectral efficiency over baselines, with significant gains in high mobility and mixed-traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The scalable, generalizable RL framework offers a promising approach for AI-native 6G RAN, using a single agent for diverse conditions.

Abstract: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where
hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass
such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and
unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges.
Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading
performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a
generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell
topology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii)
applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii)
distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training
in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although
generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our
distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training
across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five
5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency
by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and
by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic
and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks,
respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput
over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture,
offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

*Anshuk Uppal,Yuhta Takida,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework balances disentangled latent representations and generation quality by using multiple β values in a VAE and a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between disentangled representations and reconstruction quality in generative models.

Method: Train a single VAE with a new loss function for multiple β values, then use a non-linear diffusion model to transition between representations.

Result: Achieves sharp reconstructions and supports standalone generation, with smooth latent space transitions.

Conclusion: The framework improves both disentanglement and generation quality, enabling flexible manipulation of outputs.

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

TL;DR: CTPG introduces a framework for multi-task RL by using guide policies to leverage cross-task similarities, improving performance with gating mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook direct exploitation of cross-task similarities in policies. CTPG aims to use proficient tasks' policies to guide unmastered ones.

Method: CTPG trains guide policies to select behavior policies from all tasks' control policies, aided by two gating mechanisms for efficiency.

Result: Empirical results show CTPG enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks when combined with existing methods.

Conclusion: CTPG effectively leverages cross-task guidance and gating to improve multi-task RL performance.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared
information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with
carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures.
However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task
similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills
can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills
acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy
Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the
behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control
policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two
gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters
out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate
blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework
adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly
enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

TL;DR: SAD-DPSGD improves medical image classification by addressing data leakage in small, imbalanced datasets with a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data leakage in medical image classification, especially in small, imbalanced datasets like HAM10000, causes suboptimal model performance due to gradient clipping and noise issues.

Method: Proposes SAD-DPSGD, which uses linear decaying noise and clipping thresholds, allocating more privacy budget early to avoid suboptimal solutions.

Result: SAD-DPSGD outperforms Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, increasing accuracy by 2.15% under privacy constraints.

Conclusion: SAD-DPSGD effectively mitigates data leakage issues in imbalanced medical datasets, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: When applying machine learning to medical image classification, data leakage
is a critical issue. Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for
differential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but
fail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the
imbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped
and lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate. This leads the
model to fall into suboptimal solutions early. To address this, we propose
SAD-DPSGD, which uses a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping
thresholds. By allocating more privacy budget and using higher clipping
thresholds in the initial training phases, the model avoids suboptimal
solutions and enhances performance. Experiments show that SAD-DPSGD outperforms
Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, improving accuracy by 2.15% under $\epsilon = 3.0$ ,
$\delta = 10^{-3}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outlier detection methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning and model training, which is inefficient and inconvenient for diverse datasets.

Method: UniOD converts datasets into graphs, generates consistent node features, and frames outlier detection as node classification, enabling generalization to unseen domains.

Result: UniOD outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines on 15 benchmark datasets, reducing computational cost and improving accuracy.

Conclusion: UniOD offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for outlier detection across diverse domains without the need for dataset-specific adjustments.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) seeks to distinguish inliers and outliers in
completely unlabeled datasets and plays a vital role in science and
engineering. Most existing OD methods require troublesome dataset-specific
hyperparameter tuning and costly model training before they can be deployed to
identify outliers. In this work, we propose UniOD, a universal OD framework
that leverages labeled datasets to train a single model capable of detecting
outliers of datasets from diverse domains. Specifically, UniOD converts each
dataset into multiple graphs, produces consistent node features, and frames
outlier detection as a node-classification task, and is able to generalize to
unseen domains. As a result, UniOD avoids effort on model selection and
hyperparameter tuning, reduces computational cost, and effectively utilizes the
knowledge from historical datasets, which improves the convenience and accuracy
in real applications. We evaluate UniOD on 15 benchmark OD datasets against 15
state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Result: GO-Skill demonstrates effectiveness and versatility in diverse robotic manipulation tasks on the MetaWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: GO-Skill successfully enhances knowledge transfer and task performance in offline multi-task RL by leveraging reusable skills and hierarchical policy learning.

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy
capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets,
without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it
faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks.
Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we
propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed
to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task
performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented
skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a
discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable
and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the
extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical
policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that
dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks.
Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the
MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

TL;DR: A method for detecting and preventing overfitting in mesh-like data regressions using Laplace-operator derivatives for hyperparameter optimization and oscillation reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting in mesh-like data regressions by leveraging the mesh structure for derivative computations and entropy minimization.

Method: Compute derivatives on the original and staggered meshes, use Laplace-operator derivatives for loss calculation, and optimize hyperparameters to minimize entropy.

Result: Reduction of unwanted oscillations and overfitting without splitting training data for testing.

Conclusion: The method effectively prevents overfitting by utilizing mesh properties and Laplace-operator derivatives as a surrogate testing metric.

Abstract: This document reports on a method for detecting and preventing overfitting on
data regressions, herein applied to mesh-like data structures. The mesh
structure allows for the straightforward computation of the Laplace-operator
second-order derivatives in a finite-difference fashion for noiseless data.
Derivatives of the training data are computed on the original training mesh to
serve as a true label of the entropy of the training data. Derivatives of the
trained data are computed on a staggered mesh to identify oscillations in the
interior of the original training mesh cells. The loss of the Laplace-operator
derivatives is used for hyperparameter optimisation, achieving a reduction of
unwanted oscillation through the minimisation of the entropy of the trained
model. In this setup, testing does not require the splitting of points from the
training data, and training is thus directly performed on all available
training points. The Laplace operator applied to the trained data on a
staggered mesh serves as a surrogate testing metric based on diffusion
properties.

Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing disentangled representation methods in causal inference, which struggle with precise decomposition and selection bias.

Method: Proposes a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and linear orthogonal regularizer for soft decomposition, combined with importance sampling re-weighting to eliminate bias.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively models causal relationships and improves treatment effect estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention
in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we
concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown
promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental,
confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has
primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for
covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely
disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal
relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that
incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear
orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and
simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting
techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and
real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on
individual treatment effects.

Motivation: To improve fuzzy systems' ability to manage uncertainty by leveraging advancements in machine learning and federated learning.

Method: Proposes integrating machine learning for better results and federated learning for updating fuzzy rules, reducing privacy risks and latency.

Result: Identifies potential improvements but notes limitations, requiring further investigation.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements show promise but need more research to fully realize their potential in advancing fuzzy systems.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems are a way to allow machines, systems and frameworks to deal
with uncertainty, which is not possible in binary systems that most computers
use. These systems have already been deployed for certain use cases, and fuzzy
systems could be further improved as proposed in this paper. Such technologies
to draw inspiration from include machine learning and federated learning.
Machine learning is one of the recent breakthroughs of technology and could be
applied to fuzzy systems to further improve the results it produces. Federated
learning is also one of the recent technologies that have huge potential, which
allows machine learning training to improve by reducing privacy risk, reducing
burden on networking infrastructure, and reducing latency of the latest model.
Aspects from federated learning could be used to improve federated learning,
such as applying the idea of updating the fuzzy rules that make up a key part
of fuzzy systems, to further improve it over time. This paper discusses how
these improvements would be implemented in fuzzy systems, and how it would
improve fuzzy systems. It also discusses certain limitations on the potential
improvements. It concludes that these proposed ideas and improvements require
further investigation to see how far the improvements are, but the potential is
there to improve fuzzy systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing variability in power systems due to renewables and distributed energy resources necessitates reliable short-term state forecasting for stability and control. Existing GNN methods are limited to homogeneous or single-domain data.

Method: Uses Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) to model both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships in hydraulic and electrical sensor data.

Result: The method outperforms conventional baselines by 35.5% in normalized root mean square error.

Conclusion: HGAT is effective for multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting, addressing limitations of existing GNN approaches.

Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable
operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing
variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these
systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict
their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control
decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.
Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges
for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state
forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor
networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate
information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are
designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are
typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts
their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly
encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy
conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous
Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both
homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among
sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -
which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on
average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its
effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) that works with nuanced data distributions, using a value function to transfer information between expert and non-expert data, and evaluates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with bimodal-quality data, limiting practical applicability. This paper aims to address more realistic, nuanced data distributions.

Method: The method adapts RL-based imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, leveraging a value function to transfer information between expert and non-expert data.

Result: The study evaluates the method's performance across different data distributions, highlighting limitations of existing approaches and providing insights for robust IfO techniques.

Conclusion: The findings advance scalable behavior learning by improving IfO's adaptability to realistic data distributions, paving the way for iterative self-improvement in imitation learning.

Abstract: Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn
behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement
learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the
need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However,
current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality
data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast,
this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to
learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning
can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based
imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to
transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and
the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established
methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State estimation in nonlinear systems is challenging with partial/noisy measurements, requiring robust and accurate solutions beyond traditional methods.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN-Obs) that integrates system dynamics and sensor data, adaptively learning an optimal gain matrix for state convergence.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms convergence guarantees, and simulations on diverse systems (e.g., induction motor, satellite motion) show superior accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: PINN-Obs outperforms existing observers, offering a flexible and accurate solution for nonlinear state estimation.

Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in
control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy
measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive
Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state
estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers,
which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed
framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a
physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal
gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system
states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence
guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error
minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs
is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear
systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and
benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing
observer designs highlight its superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of data-driven and model-driven methods in solving differential equations, such as high data costs and efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: Uses physics-embedded analytical solutions and synthetic data to train models, leveraging DEs' intrinsic structure.

Result: Demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in 2D parametric problems, generalizing across DE scenarios.

Conclusion: MAD offers a universal paradigm for physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving
differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained
by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while
model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This
physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex
parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for
physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.

*Enda D. V. Bigarella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a smooth parametric activation function (Leaky Exponential Linear Unit) to improve regression performance in neural networks, addressing issues like overfitting and parameter sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear activation functions are essential for learning nonlinear datasets, but existing functions like ELU, SiLU, RELU, and Leaky-RELU have limitations in smoothness and gradient properties, affecting model performance.

Method: Introduces a smooth 'Leaky Exponential Linear Unit' with non-zero gradient and a novel diffusion-loss metric to evaluate model performance.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance in terms of overfitting and sensitivity to model parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed activation function and metric enhance neural network training for multidimensional nonlinear regression.

Abstract: This document proposes a parametric activation function (ac.f.) aimed at
improving multidimensional nonlinear data regression. It is a established
knowledge that nonlinear ac.f.'s are required for learning nonlinear datasets.
This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further
impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and
sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f.'s such as
ELU or SiLU have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f.'s such as RELU and
Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved
performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with
non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also
proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of
overfitting.

*Mario Tuci,Lennart Bastian,Benjamin Dupuis,Nassir Navab,Tolga Birdal,Umut Şimşekli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces interpretable topological generalization bounds for stochastic optimization algorithms, avoiding intractable mutual information terms by using trajectory stability and TDA-based complexity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topological generalization bounds rely on complex IT terms, limiting practical applicability. The goal is to create more interpretable and comprehensive bounds.

Method: Proposes a framework using trajectory stability, extending hypothesis set stability, to bound generalization error with TDA-based complexity measures.

Result: Generalization error is bounded by TDA terms and trajectory stability, with experiments showing TDA terms' significance as sample size grows.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical and interpretable alternative to existing bounds, explaining their empirical success through TDA and stability.

Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms is
a major challenge in modern learning theory. Recently, several studies
highlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the
generalization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a
series of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the
generalization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from
topological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds
rely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in
specific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),
potentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we
seek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization
bounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce
a novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies
via proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing
notion of \textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \textit{trajectory stability},
we prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be
upper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the
trajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory
stability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental
evaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great
importance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately
forms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization
bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that learns policies adhering to constraints demonstrated by experts while maximizing entropy, ensuring robust and generalizable behavior.

Method: The method leverages KL-divergence bounds and a probabilistic inference framework, optimizing the objective with dual gradient descent.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively learns constraint-abiding policies, handles multiple constraints, and generalizes across different behavior modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates constraints and entropy maximization, demonstrating practical effectiveness in imitation learning.

Abstract: This article introduces an imitation learning method for learning maximum
entropy policies that comply with constraints demonstrated by expert
trajectories executing a task. The formulation of the method takes advantage of
results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between
demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified
through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement
learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective
to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed
algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent,
supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed
method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in
settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different
modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.

have incorporated semantic elements, they often neglect critical acoustic
features. We propose an advanced approach that simultaneously encodes both

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReMix, an off-policy RL method, enhances Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) by efficiently utilizing past data, reducing training costs, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing on-policy RFT methods waste past data, leading to high compute and time costs. ReMix addresses this by enabling off-policy data usage.

Method: ReMix combines mix-policy proximal policy gradient, KL-Convex policy constraint, and policy reincarnation for efficient training and stability.

Result: ReMix achieves 52.10% to 64.39% accuracy on math benchmarks with significantly reduced training costs (30x-450x less data).

Conclusion: ReMix is a cost-effective, high-performance off-policy RFT method, revealing insights into training dynamics and behavior collapse.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective federated model aggregation without modifying architectures or loss functions, leveraging existing training signals.

Method: Uses variance-weighted classifier aggregation and SHAP-based LoRA merging for model updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks without architectural overhead.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that efficient federated model aggregation can rely solely on existing training signals.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches
for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone
parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our
method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during
standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based
merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation
scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an
explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing
update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless
integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective
model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals,
establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Prototype models are an important method for explainable artificial

perform an in-depth analysis of a set of prominent prototype models including
ProtoPNet, ProtoPool and PIPNet. For their assessment, we apply a comprehensive
set of metrics. In addition to applying standard metrics from literature, we
propose several new metrics to further complement the analysis of model
interpretability. In our experimentation, we apply the set of prototype models
on a diverse set of datasets including fine-grained classification, Non-IID
settings and multi-label classification to further contrast the performance.
Furthermore, we also provide our code as an open-source library, which
facilitates simple application of the metrics itself, as well as extensibility
- providing the option for easily adding new metrics and models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeLo is a multi-modal emotion distribution learning framework that leverages cross-attention and optimal transport to explore heterogeneity and label correlations in emotional data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion distribution learning (EDL) methods struggle with multi-modal heterogeneity and underutilize semantic correlations among basic emotions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: HeLo uses cross-attention for data fusion, optimal transport for heterogeneity mining, and learnable label embeddings with correlation matrix alignment for label correlation learning.

Result: HeLo achieves superior performance on two public datasets for emotion distribution learning.

Conclusion: The proposed HeLo framework effectively addresses multi-modal heterogeneity and label correlation challenges, advancing emotion distribution learning.

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays
a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since
different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with
single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that
identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.
However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among
multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic
emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring
the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data
and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt
cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal
transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the
interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral
representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a
learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,
the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated
with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven
cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining iterative methods and pathwise conditioning to scale Gaussian processes for large datasets and modern hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Gaussian processes struggle with scalability for large data and parallel computation, necessitating improved methods.

Method: Uses iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning to reduce memory usage and leverage matrix multiplication.

Result: Enables Gaussian processes to handle larger datasets efficiently, optimized for modern hardware.

Conclusion: The synergistic approach significantly enhances the scalability and practicality of Gaussian processes.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a powerful framework for uncertainty-aware function
approximation and sequential decision-making. Unfortunately, their classical
formulation does not scale gracefully to large amounts of data and modern
hardware for massively-parallel computation, prompting many researchers to
develop techniques which improve their scalability. This dissertation focuses
on the powerful combination of iterative methods and pathwise conditioning to
develop methodological contributions which facilitate the use of Gaussian
processes in modern large-scale settings. By combining these two techniques
synergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems
of linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.
This drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to
significantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as
the main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.

TL;DR: DiffSpectra is a generative framework using diffusion models to infer 2D/3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data, outperforming traditional and retrieval-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for molecular structure elucidation are unscalable and rely on expert interpretation, while existing machine learning methods lack generalization to novel molecules.

Method: DiffSpectra uses a diffusion model with an SE(3)-equivariant architecture (Diffusion Molecule Transformer) and a transformer-based spectral encoder (SpecFormer) for multi-modal spectral conditioning.

Result: DiffSpectra achieves 16.01% top-1 and 96.86% top-20 accuracy in recovering exact structures, benefiting from 3D geometric modeling and multi-modal conditioning.

Conclusion: DiffSpectra is the first framework unifying multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling, effectively addressing molecular structure elucidation.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

TL;DR: The paper studies an online decision-making problem with contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances, featuring non-stationary contexts and shared latent conversion models. It proposes an algorithm achieving sub-linear regret in the number of episodes, leveraging a confidence bound oracle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses dynamic resource allocation problems like dynamic pricing and auctions, where contexts change non-stationarily and resources are replenished episodically.

Method: An online algorithm is designed, assuming access to a confidence bound oracle from contextual bandit literature, to handle unbounded state spaces and non-stationary contexts.

Result: The algorithm achieves sub-linear regret in the number of episodes, with improved bounds when unlabeled feature data is provided.

Conclusion: The framework advances contextual BwK literature by handling non-stationary contexts and leveraging unlabeled data for better performance.

Abstract: We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with
contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These
episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability
distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same
latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a
request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications
such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment,
and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets.
We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the
number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that
achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing
contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with
arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning
problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret
bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data,
which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated causal discovery method that works in both horizontal and vertical federated settings, addressing data privacy and incomplete variable issues by using higher-order cumulants for global causal structure learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated causal discovery methods are limited to horizontal settings, but real-world scenarios often involve incomplete variable sets across clients, leading to spurious causal relationships. This work aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The method aggregates higher-order cumulants from clients to construct global estimates, enabling recursive source identification and producing a global causal strength matrix. It supports both horizontal and vertical federated settings.

Result: The algorithm performs well on synthetic and real-world data, successfully reconstructing causal graphs and estimating causal strength coefficients.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of federated causal discovery in diverse settings, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between
entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and
numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal
structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings.
However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain
data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables
can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the
information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we
comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both
horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification
theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and
vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first
aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to
construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for
recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength
matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but
also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm
demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic
data and real-world data.

### [65] [Designing Adaptive Algorithms Based on Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Optimization of Sliding Window Size in Multi-Dimensional Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06901)
*Abolfazl Zarghani,Sadegh Abedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning (RL)-based method, RL-Window, dynamically optimizes sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional data streams, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-dimensional data streams present challenges like high velocity and complex dependencies, requiring adaptive solutions beyond fixed-size windows.

Method: RL-Window uses a Dueling Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay to learn adaptive window sizes based on stream characteristics.

Result: RL-Window excels in classification accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method is adaptable, stable, and suitable for real-time applications, as validated by extended metrics and qualitative analyses.

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial
markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high
velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding
window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size
windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty
patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based
approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional
data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable
an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as
variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a
Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle
non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
(UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms
state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification
accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional
qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and
a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and
stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

TL;DR: Proposes an N-version machine learning (NVML) framework with safety-aware weighted soft voting to enhance robustness of traffic sign recognition against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems, particularly traffic sign recognition, which is vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Method: Uses NVML with a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism, assessed via FMEA for dynamic weight assignment. Evaluated against FGSM and PGD attacks.

Result: NVML significantly improves robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The NVML framework effectively enhances the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is rapidly advancing as a key application of machine
learning, yet ensuring the safety of these systems remains a critical
challenge. Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous
vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML)
framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our
approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential
safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs.
We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various
voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the
robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial
conditions.

*Tongtian Zhu,Wenhao Li,Can Wang,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICE, a method to estimate data influence cascades in decentralized learning, addressing the lack of fair incentives for participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning lacks proper incentives, discouraging participation. Fair attribution of contributions is challenging due to influence cascades in decentralized networks.

Method: Designs DICE, a method to estimate data influence cascades, considering data, communication topology, and loss landscape curvature.

Result: DICE provides tractable approximations of influence cascades and supports applications like collaborator selection and malicious behavior detection.

Conclusion: DICE offers a foundational solution for fair incentives in decentralized learning, with practical applications.

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data
consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed
compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the
exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in
absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair
incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to
participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the
localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network.
To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized
environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of
influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence
cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the
curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications
including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

### [68] [What Has a Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06952)
*Keyon Vafa,Peter G. Chang,Ashesh Rambachan,Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation models' ability to capture deeper domain understanding by testing their inductive biases on synthetic datasets, revealing they often fail to generalize beyond training tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether foundation models truly learn underlying world models or just task-specific heuristics.

Method: Developed an inductive bias probe technique, testing models on synthetic datasets derived from postulated world models.

Result: Foundation models excel at training tasks but fail to align with underlying world models when adapted to new tasks, especially in physics.

Conclusion: Foundation models may develop task-specific heuristics rather than generalizable understanding, limiting their broader applicability.

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.

### [69] [Noisy PDE Training Requires Bigger PINNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06967)
*Sebastien Andre-Sloan,Anirbit Mukherjee,Matthew Colbrook*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the conditions under which Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can achieve low empirical risk with noisy data, proving a lower bound on network size and demonstrating empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the requirements for PINNs to perform effectively with noisy data in solving PDEs.

Method: Theoretical proof of a lower bound on neural network size and empirical validation using the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) PDE.

Result: A predictor achieving empirical risk $O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ requires $d_N\log d_N \gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, showing noisy labels alone don't guarantee reduced risk.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational insights into the parameter requirements for training PINNs with noisy data, validated empirically.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate
solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high
dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is
important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.
However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so
effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for
the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy
supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk
$O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily
$d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$
is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies
to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled
noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone
does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show
empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$
under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for
quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in
the presence of noise.

*Bogdan Kulynych,Juan Felipe Gomez,Georgios Kaissis,Jamie Hayes,Borja Balle,Flavio du Pin Calmon,Jean Louis Raisaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework using $f$-DP to interpret and calibrate privacy risks in differentially private mechanisms, offering tighter bounds and reduced noise requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mapping privacy parameters to risks (re-identification, attribute inference, data reconstruction) are pessimistic and inconsistent. A unified approach is needed.

Method: Uses the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP) to derive unified bounds for privacy risks, ensuring consistency and tunability.

Result: The bounds are tighter than prior methods, reducing noise by 20% and improving accuracy (e.g., 15pp in text classification).

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled way to interpret and calibrate DP protection against specific risks, improving practicality and performance.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary
(including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp
accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

### [71] [A Principled Framework for Multi-View Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06979)
*Panagiotis Koromilas,Efthymios Georgiou,Giorgos Bouritsas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Mihalis A. Nicolaou,Yannis Panagakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel loss functions, MV-InfoNCE and MV-DHEL, to address limitations in multi-view contrastive learning, improving performance and scalability with increasing view multiplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view contrastive learning methods handle additional views suboptimally, leading to conflicting objectives, limited interactions, and failure to fully leverage view multiplicity.

Method: Proposes MV-InfoNCE and MV-DHEL, which incorporate all view interactions and decouple alignment from uniformity, respectively, while scaling with view multiplicity.

Result: Empirical results show superior performance on ImageNet1K and other datasets, scalability with more views, and mitigation of dimensionality collapse.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address multi-view contrastive learning limitations, delivering benefits akin to supervised learning.

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

*Eunbyeol Cho,Jiyoun Kim,Minjae Lee,Sungjin Park,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RawMed is a framework for synthesizing multi-table, time-series EHR data resembling raw EHRs, addressing privacy concerns and outperforming baselines in fidelity and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions limit EHR data sharing, necessitating synthetic datasets that closely mimic raw EHRs.

Method: RawMed uses text-based representation and compression techniques to capture complex structures and temporal dynamics with minimal preprocessing.

Result: Validated on two datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models in fidelity and utility.

Conclusion: RawMed provides a novel solution for generating synthetic EHR data while preserving privacy and utility.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at

*Emile Pierret,Bruno Galerne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the accuracy of diffusion models as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, specifically for deblurring Gaussian data, by comparing theoretical and practical results using Wasserstein distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are popular for inverse problems due to their flexibility, but their performance accuracy remains unclear. This study aims to quantify their effectiveness in a controlled setting.

Method: The study uses a Gaussian data distribution for deblurring, computing the exact Wasserstein distance between diffusion model outputs and ideal solutions to analyze discrepancies.

Result: The findings provide precise comparisons of different algorithms, highlighting the gap between theoretical and practical performance of diffusion models.

Conclusion: The study offers a framework to assess diffusion models' accuracy in inverse problems, enabling better algorithm comparisons.

Abstract: Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently
attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high
variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as
inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved
questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate
the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for
deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze
the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and
their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact
Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler
and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings
allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.

Abstract: In this paper, an edge-side model training study is conducted on a
resource-limited smart meter. The motivation of grid-edge intelligence and the
concept of on-device training are introduced. Then, the technical preparation
steps for on-device training are described. A case study on the task of
photovoltaic power forecasting is presented, where two representative machine
learning models are investigated: a gradient boosting tree model and a

the smart meter, "mixed"- and "reduced"-precision training schemes are also
devised. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of economically

TL;DR: PLAME is a novel MSA design model using evolutionary embeddings and a conservation-diversity loss to improve protein structure prediction, especially for low-homology and orphan proteins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current folding models rely heavily on MSAs, limiting their effectiveness for low-homology and orphan proteins. PLAME aims to overcome this by leveraging pretrained protein language models.

Method: PLAME uses evolutionary embeddings, a conservation-diversity loss, and a novel MSA selection method. It also introduces a sequence quality assessment metric.

Result: PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-homology and orphan proteins, enhancing AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 predictions. It also matches AlphaFold2 accuracy with ESMFold's speed.

Conclusion: PLAME effectively addresses MSA dependency issues, improving protein structure prediction and offering insights into MSA characteristics' impact on prediction quality.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for edge devices, balancing performance and energy efficiency, and shows tailored SSL can reduce resource use by 4X.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning (CL) and SSL require large resources, making edge deployment challenging. This work investigates SSL's feasibility and efficiency for resource-constrained edge learning.

Method: Analyzes SSL techniques under limited computational, data, and energy budgets, and evaluates semi-supervised learning for reducing labeling energy costs.

Result: Tailored SSL strategies achieve competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X.

Conclusion: SSL is viable for energy-efficient edge learning, with potential for significant resource savings.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to
traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich
representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more
broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of
data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and
efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs
between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how
different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy
budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations
under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy
costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may
assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve
competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X,
underscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.

*Shervin Ghaffari,Zohre Bahranifard,Mohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An ensemble embedding approach improves semantic caching in LLM systems by combining multiple embedding models, outperforming single-model methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic caching frameworks use single embedding models, limiting their ability to capture diverse semantic relationships in queries.

Method: Proposes an ensemble embedding approach with a trained meta-encoder to enhance semantic similarity detection, evaluated using the QQP dataset.

Result: Achieves 92% cache hit ratio for equivalent queries and 85% accuracy in rejecting non-equivalent ones, outperforming single-model methods.

Conclusion: Ensemble embedding significantly improves caching performance and reduces computational overhead in LLM systems.

Abstract: Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM)
systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once,
and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic
caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,
which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships
present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble
embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained
meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.
We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring
cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our
ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent
queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting
non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble
embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in
distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to
more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in
LLM-based systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts (DCE) framework to address intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain shifts in Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIL struggles with imbalanced data, causing underfitting of few-shot classes and challenges in maintaining many-shot class knowledge across domains.

Method: DCE uses frequency-aware expert groups and a dynamic expert selector with balanced Gaussian sampling to balance knowledge preservation and transfer.

Result: DCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DCE effectively tackles DIL challenges by balancing intra-domain and cross-domain class imbalances.

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

*Martin Marek,Sanae Lotfi,Aditya Somasundaram,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Micah Goldblum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Small batch sizes in language model training can be stable and robust, outperforming larger batches per-FLOP, with adjusted Adam hyperparameters. Gradient accumulation is unnecessary unless constrained by inter-device bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that small batch sizes are unstable and require gradient accumulation, exploring their potential benefits.

Method: Revisit small batch sizes (down to size one), propose scaling rules for Adam hyperparameters, and evaluate stability, robustness, and performance.

Result: Small batches train stably, are robust to hyperparameters, match or exceed larger batches per-FLOP, and enable stable SGD training.

Conclusion: Recommend small batch sizes with adjusted hyperparameters and advise against gradient accumulation unless bandwidth-limited.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model
pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which
trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch
size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,
other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small
batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for
scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch
sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter
choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch
sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,
even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these
results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and
setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient
accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas,
bottlenecked by inter-device bandwidth.

*Arnas Uselis,Andrea Dittadi,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores whether vision models exhibit compositional generalization, finding that data diversity, not scale, drives it. A linearly factored representational structure is key for efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if contemporary vision models achieve compositional generalization and how data properties influence it.

Method: Controlled experiments varying data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage, evaluating pretrained models (DINO, CLIP).

Result: Compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not scale. A linearly factored structure enables perfect generalization from few combinations. Pretrained models show partial success.

Conclusion: Diverse datasets and linearly factored representational structures are crucial for efficient compositional learning.

Abstract: Compositional understanding is crucial for human intelligence, yet it remains
unclear whether contemporary vision models exhibit it. The dominant machine
learning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes
will improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional
generalization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that
systematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We
find that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere
data scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a
linearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into
additive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling
perfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained
models (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting
partial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on
constructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering
the importance of representational structure that enables efficient
compositional learning. Code available at

### [81] [Unveiling the Underwater World: CLIP Perception Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06234)
*Jiangzhong Cao,Zekai Zeng,Xu Zhang,Huan Zhang,Chunling Fan,Gangyi Jiang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A UIE method using CLIP perception loss and curriculum contrastive regularization improves underwater image quality by aligning with human perception and enhancing constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from quality degradation due to light absorption and scattering, and existing deep learning methods often ignore human perception and lack solution space constraints.

Method: Proposes a UIE method with a CLIP perception loss module and curriculum contrastive regularization to align with human perception and improve constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances underwater images by integrating CLIP perception and curriculum contrastive regularization.

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

*Ali Nasiri-Sarvi,Hassan Rivaz,Mahdi S. Hosseini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC introduces a unified latent space for AI models, improving cross-model interpretability with innovations like Global TopK sparsity and Cross-Reconstruction Loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods produce isolated concept spaces, limiting cross-model interpretability.

Method: SPARC uses Global TopK sparsity and Cross-Reconstruction Loss to align latent spaces across models.

Result: Achieves 0.80 Jaccard similarity, tripling alignment compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: SPARC enables direct comparison of concepts across models and practical applications like cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF introduces a probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, addressing computational inefficiencies and geometric inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise surface geometry and uncertainty awareness in scientific simulations, like fluid flow through forests, drives the development of BayesSDF.

Method: BayesSDF uses a Laplace approximation and Hessian-based metrics for efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation in SDF models.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in calibration and geometric consistency, providing actionable confidence measures.

Conclusion: BayesSDF establishes a robust foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction and simulation, benefiting downstream applications like robotics.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIRA is a framework addressing inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension in LMMs by combining visual comprehension and segmentation via SEFE and ILVC, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension due to weak visual comprehension and lack of fine-grained perception.

Method: LIRA uses SEFE for semantic-pixel feature fusion and ILVC for autoregressive local descriptions. It also introduces AttrEval dataset to quantify segmentation-semantics correlation.

Result: LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmentation and comprehension tasks.

Conclusion: LIRA effectively mitigates LMM limitations and advances multi-modal model capabilities.

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent

diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key

and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

*Joon Tai Kim,Tianle Chen,Ziyu Dong,Nishanth Kunchala,Alexander Guller,Daniel Ospina Acero,Roger Williams,Mrinal Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCPDA, a data augmentation method to improve fire-class segmentation in wildland fire datasets by copying and refining fire clusters from source to target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity and cost of labeled datasets for training segmentation models in wildland fire science, especially for the fire class.

Method: CCPDA involves identifying fire clusters, centralizing them to focus on the core fire area, and pasting them onto target images to enhance dataset diversity.

Result: CCPDA improves fire-class segmentation performance, outperforming other augmentation methods, as validated by numerical analysis.

Conclusion: CCPDA effectively mitigates challenges of small labeled datasets and enhances fire-class segmentation, proving superior to other methods.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

TL;DR: AR2 enhances CNN robustness to corruptions by aligning class activation maps between clean and corrupted images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks degrade under common corruptions, limiting real-world reliability. AR2 aims to improve robustness without architectural changes.

Method: AR2 aligns CAMs between clean and corrupted images, using iterative CAM-guided refinement and fine-tuning.

Result: AR2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C benchmarks, balancing clean accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: AR2 offers a scalable solution for improving model reliability in diverse real-world corruptions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Motivation: Bio-impedance sensing is underutilized in HAR due to lack of labeled data. SImpHAR aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses a simulation pipeline with 3D human meshes and a two-stage training strategy for data augmentation and broader activity coverage.

Result: Achieves up to 22.3% accuracy and 21.8% macro F1 score improvements on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simulation-driven augmentation and modular training show promise for impedance-based HAR.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

TL;DR: PCL-Former, a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture, improves temporal action localization by using specialized transformer modules for proposal, classification, and localization tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of transformers and multi-stage architectures in video recognition and object detection inspired their application to temporal action localization (TAL) to leverage spatio-temporal properties.

Method: PCL-Former uses three dedicated transformer modules: Proposal-Former for segment identification, Classification-Former for action categorization, and Localization-Former for boundary prediction, each with specialized loss functions.

Result: PCL-Former outperforms state-of-the-art TAL methods by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture of PCL-Former effectively addresses TAL tasks, demonstrating superior performance through specialized modules and loss functions.

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THOR is a real-time adaptive RGB frame sampling method using thermal sensing to reduce power and computational costs while maintaining high activity recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable cameras face challenges like high power consumption, excessive data generation, privacy issues, and computational demands for real-time analysis.

Method: THOR uses thermal sensing to detect hand-activity transitions, adjusting RGB sampling rates and cropping regions of interest for efficient processing.

Result: The method captures all activity segments with 3% of original RGB data, achieving 95% F1-score for activity recognition.

Conclusion: THOR enables practical, long-term use of wearable cameras for real-time monitoring of hand-related activities and health behaviors.

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional frame-based vision systems have limitations like motion blur and high latency, while event cameras face challenges in object detection due to sparse, noisy data.

Method: The proposed model uses convolutional encoding, adaptive threshold selection, and a lightweight classifier to efficiently compress and reconstruct event data.

Result: The model achieves comparable accuracy to YOLO-v4 with 35.5x fewer parameters and demonstrates high frame rates (8-44.8 FPS) on embedded platforms.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances event-based vision performance, making it suitable for real-time, low-power edge computing applications.

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

TL;DR: VOTE is an efficient framework for Vision Language Action (VLA) models, improving generalization and speed without relying on additional visual representations or diffusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with novel objects or environments and require computationally expensive components for generalization.

Method: Proposes a tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel action prediction and an ensemble voting strategy for action sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35x faster inference and 145 Hz throughput.

Conclusion: VOTE offers a lightweight, efficient solution for VLA models, enhancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: Video-RTS improves video reasoning efficiency by combining data-efficient RL and adaptive test-time scaling, outperforming existing models with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high costs and scalability issues of traditional RL-based video reasoning methods that rely on extensive supervised fine-tuning and annotations.

Method: Skipping supervised fine-tuning, using pure-RL training with output-based rewards, and introducing a sparse-to-dense video test-time scaling strategy for efficient inference.

Result: Video-RTS surpasses existing models by 2.4% accuracy on average, using only 3.6% of training samples, with notable improvements on benchmarks like Video-Holmes (4.2%) and MMVU (2.6%).

Conclusion: Video-RTS demonstrates strong reasoning performance through efficient RL training and adaptive scaling, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for video reasoning.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and

*Yuechen Xie,Haobo Jiang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask6D, a novel pre-training strategy for 6D pose estimation, uses pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence and visible mask maps to improve feature extraction in cluttered scenes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation networks struggle with discriminative feature extraction in cluttered or occluded conditions using RGB images alone.

Method: Proposes Mask6D, incorporating pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence and visible mask maps for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning for pose prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mask6D outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Conclusion: Mask6D effectively addresses feature extraction challenges in cluttered scenes, enhancing 6D pose estimation performance.

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

*Yupeng Hu,Changxing Ding,Chang Sun,Shaoli Huang,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BC-HOI, a framework for open vocabulary HOI detection, using Attention Bias Guidance and LLM-based Supervision to improve fine-grained feature generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on coarse-grained VLM features, which are unsuitable for detection tasks. The goal is to enhance interaction representation generalization.

Method: Proposes BC-HOI with ABG for fine-grained instance-level features and LSG for token-level supervision from LLMs.

Result: Achieves superior performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks in both open and closed settings.

Conclusion: BC-HOI effectively addresses the limitations of VLM features, improving HOI detection accuracy.

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Abstract: Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have
significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To
facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey
systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in
traffic scenarios and comprehensively analyzes available vision-driven tasks

taxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups
that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories
and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related
fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the
analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and
visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The

aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and
recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving
field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic
resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.

TL;DR: FIFA is a unified framework for evaluating and correcting hallucinations in VideoMLLMs, outperforming existing methods and improving factual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of hallucinations in VideoMLLMs and the lack of comprehensive evaluation methods for open-ended tasks.

Method: Proposes FIFA, which extracts descriptive facts, models dependencies via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. Introduces Post-Correction for revising hallucinations.

Result: FIFA aligns better with human judgment than existing methods, and Post-Correction enhances factual consistency in text and video generation.

Conclusion: FIFA and Post-Correction effectively address hallucinations in VideoMLLMs, improving evaluation and generation quality.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

*Chaoshuo Zhang,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Le Yang,Qian Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU), a method to balance unlearning harmful concepts in text-to-image diffusion models while retaining generative quality by targeting key denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misuse of text-to-image diffusion models by improving unlearning effectiveness without compromising generative retainability.

Method: KSCU focuses on pivotal denoising steps for concept unlearning, fine-tuning only at these steps to reduce parameter updates.

Result: KSCU effectively prevents undesirable image generation while better retaining the model's generative capabilities.

Conclusion: KSCU offers a targeted and efficient solution for concept unlearning in diffusion models, balancing security and performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

*Kazi Mahathir Rahman,Naveed Imtiaz Nafis,Md. Farhan Sadik,Mohammad Al Rafi,Mehedi Hasan Shahed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline converts English speech into 3D sign language animations using Whisper, MarianMT, and motion synthesis, achieving high BLEU scores and natural animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked task of translating spoken English into sign language animations, improving communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.

Method: The system uses Whisper for speech-to-text, MarianMT for text-to-gloss translation, and a 3D motion system trained on Sign3D-WLASL for animation. Word embeddings enhance gloss accuracy.

Result: Achieves BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923 for gloss translation and produces smooth, realistic 3D animations.

Conclusion: The pipeline integrates audio, text, and motion into a unified framework, advancing the field of sign language translation.

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

*Mingjin Zeng,Nan Ouyang,Wenkang Wan,Lei Ao,Qing Cai,Kai Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ILNet introduces Inverse Learning attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection for multi-agent trajectory prediction, improving accuracy and adaptability in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human drivers dynamically adjust decisions based on others' intentions, inspiring a need for better spatio-temporal interaction modeling in trajectory prediction.

Method: ILNet uses Inverse Learning attention for dynamic spatio-temporal coordination and a Dynamic Anchor Selection module for adaptable trajectory refinement.

Result: ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on INTERACTION and Argoverse datasets, excelling in complex interactions with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: ILNet's dynamic modeling and adaptable anchor selection enhance trajectory prediction, especially in challenging multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a model-agnostic active learning approach for wildlife detection, reducing labeled data needs by 70% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife data from camera traps is voluminous and costly to label, requiring efficient methods to reduce labeling effort for automated monitoring.

Method: Integrates uncertainty and diversity metrics at object and image levels for active learning sample selection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detector performance using only 30% of training data.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient wildlife monitoring with minimal labeled data, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToBo is a self-supervised learning pipeline that compresses scenes into bottleneck tokens and predicts future scenes using minimal hints, excelling in sequential tasks like video tracking and robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for compact, temporally aware visual representations in dynamic scene understanding tasks.

Method: ToBo squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts subsequent scenes using minimal patches as hints, embedding temporal dependencies.

Result: Outperforms baselines in video label propagation and robotic manipulation, with real-world robustness and scalability across model sizes.

Conclusion: ToBo effectively learns sequential scene representations, demonstrating practical utility in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-TRAK, a method for concept-level attribution in diffusion models, addressing copyright and transparency concerns by isolating contributions to specific image elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing adoption of diffusion models raises concerns about copyright and transparency, with existing methods failing to attribute influences to specific elements like styles or objects.

Method: Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with a reformulated diffusion training loss and a concept-aware reward function for robust, sample-specific attribution.

Result: Concept-TRAK outperforms prior methods on the AbC benchmark and provides actionable insights for responsible AI development through case studies.

Conclusion: Concept-level attribution via Concept-TRAK offers a practical solution for addressing copyright and transparency issues in generative AI.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

TL;DR: Proposes a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) to capture joint structure across multiple augmented views in contrastive learning, improving performance and efficiency without needing a temperature hyperparameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods in contrastive learning focus on pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all augmented views.

Method: Introduces DSF, which represents sets of augmented views as distributions and measures similarity via divergence between distributions.

Result: DSF improves performance in tasks like kNN classification and linear evaluation, and is more efficient than other multi-view methods.

Conclusion: DSF effectively captures joint structure, outperforms existing methods, and eliminates the need for a temperature hyperparameter.

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

*Hao Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective for edge detection that categorizes pixels into edge, boundary, and texture, improving precision and localization over the traditional WBCE loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current edge detection methods, using WBCE loss, treat non-edge pixels uniformly, leading to blurred predictions and overlooking structural nuances near edges.

Method: The EBT loss divides pixels into three categories (edge, boundary, texture) with distinct weights, enabling structured learning and better contextual localization.

Result: Experiments show EBT loss outperforms WBCE loss quantitatively and perceptually, with minimal fine-tuning required.

Conclusion: The EBT loss is a robust, easily deployable improvement for edge detection, generalizing WBCE loss and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

TL;DR: MOST introduces a motion diffusion model using temporal clip Banzhaf interaction to improve text-to-motion generation, especially for rare prompts, by addressing redundancy and enhancing fine-grained matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with coarse-grained matching and overlook semantic cues due to motion redundancy, limiting their effectiveness for rare language prompts.

Method: MOST employs temporal clip Banzhaf interaction for fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and a motion prompt module for generation, ensuring semantic consistency.

Result: MOST achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-motion retrieval and generation, particularly excelling with rare prompts.

Conclusion: MOST effectively addresses previous challenges in motion generation, offering a robust solution for fine-grained, semantically consistent text-to-motion tasks.

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AMContrast3D and AMContrast3D++ for adaptive margin contrastive learning in 3D semantic segmentation, addressing point ambiguities and improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all points equally, ignoring ambiguities in transition regions, leading to sub-optimal models due to unreliable labels for ambiguous points.

Method: Introduces AMContrast3D for adaptive objectives based on ambiguity levels and AMContrast3D++ with a parallel training branch and ambiguity prediction module. Uses masked refinement for reliable embeddings.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, improving segmentation performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The adaptive margin contrastive learning approach effectively handles point ambiguities, enhancing segmentation accuracy and model reliability.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera system (DCS) and exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) are proposed to eliminate flickering in HDR video reconstruction by capturing consistent reference sequences and supplementing information, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exposure fluctuations in alternating exposure methods cause flickering in HDR video reconstruction, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The DCS uses one camera for consistent reference sequences and another for supplementary data. EAFNet includes pre-alignment, asymmetric cross-feature fusion, and reconstruction subnetworks to enhance and fuse features adaptively.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, reducing flickering and ghosting artifacts.

Conclusion: The DCS and EAFNet demonstrate significant potential for high-quality HDR video reconstruction, with codes and data made publicly available.

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross-Modal Dual-Causal Learning (CMDCL) to address long-term action recognition challenges by uncovering causal relationships between videos and label texts, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is difficult due to extended temporal spans and complex correlations. Existing methods lack cross-modal causal modeling, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: CMDCL introduces a structural causal model for cross-modal causal relationships, using textual and visual causal interventions to address biases and confounders.

Result: CMDCL demonstrates effectiveness on benchmarks like Charades, Breakfast, and COIN.

Conclusion: The dual-causal interventions in CMDCL enable robust action representations, addressing LTAR challenges effectively.

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

*Qing Zhang,Guoquan Pei,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Omni-Fuse, a novel spatial-spectral fusion network, improves hyperspectral image segmentation by addressing high dimensionality and spectral redundancy, achieving a 5.73% DSC improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) aids disease diagnosis but struggles with fusing spatial and spectral data due to high dimensionality and redundancy.

Method: Omni-Fuse uses cross-dimensional feature fusion, bidirectional attention, spectral-guided spatial query selection, and a two-stage decoder for efficient segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 5.73% increase in DSC on microscopic hyperspectral datasets.

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse effectively addresses MHSI challenges, enhancing segmentation performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

### [112] [PointVDP: Learning View-Dependent Projection by Fireworks Rays for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06618)
*Yang Chen,Yueqi Duan,Haowen Sun,Ziwei Wang,Jiwen Lu,Yap-Peng Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes View-Dependent Projection (VDP) for efficient 3D-to-2D mapping in point cloud segmentation, addressing limitations of view-independent methods with adaptive, data-driven projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection-based methods are limited by pre-defined parameters, leading to inefficiency and lack of projection diversity. VDP aims to overcome these issues with adaptive, lightweight projections.

Method: Designs VDP framework for data-driven projections inspired by fireworks' adaptive behavior, incorporating color regularization to optimize feature emphasis and space utilization.

Result: PointVDP achieves competitive performance on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: VDP offers a resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding in point cloud segmentation, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

*Myungjang Pyeon,Janghyeon Lee,Minsoo Lee,Juseung Yun,Hwanil Choi,Jonghyun Kim,Jiwon Kim,Yi Hu,Jongseong Jang,Soonyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EXAONE Path 2.0 improves biomarker prediction in digital pathology by using slide-level supervision for patch-level representations, achieving state-of-the-art results with high data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-level self-supervised learning (SSL) in digital pathology overlooks domain-specific features and is less data-efficient than supervised methods.

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0 learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision, using 37k whole-slide images (WSIs).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks with remarkable data efficiency.

Conclusion: Slide-level supervision enhances patch-level learning, improving biomarker prediction efficiency and performance.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

*Farahdiba Zarin,Riccardo Oliva,Vinkle Srivastav,Armine Vardazaryan,Andrea Rosati,Alice Zampolini Faustini,Giovanni Scambia,Anna Fagotti,Pietro Mascagni,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses learning dense keypoint localization from sparse pixel-level annotations in medical imaging, proposing a novel loss function (Crag and Tail loss) to improve accuracy despite limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse labels in medical imaging, due to high annotation costs, hinder dense prediction tasks like keypoint localization, especially for new tasks like carcinosis keypoint detection in ovarian cancer.

Method: The problem is framed as sparse heatmap regression. A new loss function, Crag and Tail loss, is introduced to efficiently learn from sparse annotations while mitigating false negatives.

Result: The approach achieves accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints, validated through extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise for advancing research in scenarios where dense annotations are impractical, offering a practical solution for sparse label challenges.

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

TL;DR: ClipGS is a Gaussian splatting framework for interactive cinematic visualization of medical data, improving rendering quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing diagnostic accuracy and surgical planning through high-quality visualization of volumetric medical data, despite high computing costs and slow rendering speeds.

Method: Introduces ClipGS with a learnable truncation scheme and adaptive adjustment model to dynamically manage Gaussian primitives and improve rendering performance.

Result: Achieves 36.635 PSNR rendering quality, 156 FPS, and 16.1 MB model size, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ClipGS offers superior rendering quality and efficiency for medical data visualization, addressing practical challenges.

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

*Juncheng Mu,Chengwei Ren,Weixiang Zhang,Liang Pan,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P is a novel differentiable I2P registration framework using diffusion models to bridge the modality gap, improving cross-modal feature learning and registration accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration struggle with the modality gap, leading to inaccurate cross-modal correspondences.

Method: Proposes Diff$^2$I2P with Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) and Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) for differentiable correspondence and transformation estimation.

Result: Achieves over 7% improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P effectively leverages diffusion models to enhance cross-modal feature learning and registration performance.

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDR-CA, a task refining diversity of multiple attributes in text-to-image retrieval, proposing Multi-Source DPPs as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus only on appearance diversity, limiting applicability. CDR-CA addresses this by refining diversities contextually.

Method: Proposes Multi-Source DPPs, extending DPP to multi-sources with a unified similarity matrix and Tangent Normalization for context.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method's effectiveness in refining diversities contextually.

Conclusion: CDR-CA and Multi-Source DPPs offer a robust solution for contextual diversity refinement in text-to-image retrieval.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

*Hongjie Wu,Mingqin Zhang,Linchao He,Ji-Zhe Zhou,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gradient dynamics in diffusion models for image restoration, identifies instabilities, and proposes SPGD for improved stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored interactions and instabilities between prior and likelihood gradients in diffusion models for image restoration.

Method: Proposes SPGD with progressive likelihood warm-up and adaptive directional momentum smoothing.

Result: SPGD enhances stability and achieves state-of-the-art performance in restoration tasks.

Conclusion: SPGD effectively mitigates gradient conflicts and fluctuations, improving restoration quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

TL;DR: MK-Pose, a multimodal keypoint learning framework, integrates RGB, point clouds, and textual descriptions to improve category-level object pose estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for category-level object pose estimation struggle with occlusion and generalization across instances and categories.

Method: MK-Pose combines RGB, point clouds, and textual data with self-supervised keypoint detection, attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching, and graph-based relational modeling.

Result: MK-Pose achieves superior performance in IoU and average precision on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach effectively addresses occlusion and generalization challenges in category-level pose estimation.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

TL;DR: FlexGaussian introduces a flexible, training-free method for compressing 3D Gaussian splatting models, combining mixed-precision quantization and pruning to achieve high compression ratios without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient compression of large-scale 3D Gaussian models, especially for resource-constrained devices, without the inflexibility and retraining demands of existing methods.

Method: FlexGaussian uses mixed-precision quantization and attribute-discriminative pruning for training-free compression, adapting to varying constraints.

Result: Achieves up to 96.4% compression with minimal quality loss (<1 dB PSNR drop), 1.7-2.1x faster than training-free methods, and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches.

Conclusion: FlexGaussian is a fast, flexible, and effective solution for compressing 3D Gaussian models, suitable for mobile and edge deployment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack quantity awareness in text-promptable object counting, limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes QUANet with quantity-oriented prompts, a vision-text alignment loss, and a dual-stream decoder (Transformer + CNN) with T2C-adapters and a cross-stream ranking loss.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalizability in zero-shot class-agnostic counting on benchmarks like FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech.

Conclusion: QUANet effectively enhances quantity awareness and counting accuracy in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating music into realistic dance videos by capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in skeleton sequences and improving video synthesis.

Method: STG-Mamba uses two mappings: music-to-skeleton (via STGM blocks) and skeleton-to-video (via a self-supervised regularization network). A new dataset of 54,944 clips is also introduced.

Result: STG-Mamba outperforms existing methods in generating dance videos from music.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively synthesizes dance videos from music, leveraging spatial-temporal dependencies and a novel dataset for superior performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the
music-guided dance video synthesis task, i.e., to translate the input music to
a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings:
music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,
along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new
skeleton-to-video translation dataset from the Internet, containing 54,944

TL;DR: SpatialReasoner enhances 3D visual grounding by integrating LLM-driven spatial reasoning and hierarchical feature fields for accurate object localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with spatial relation understanding in 3D scenes and language queries, limiting accurate object localization.

Method: Proposes SpatialReasoner, combining LLM fine-tuning for spatial relation inference and a hierarchical feature field enhanced by visual properties (opacity, color) and CLIP/SAM features.

Result: Outperforms baselines in 3D visual grounding, improving spatial reasoning and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner effectively addresses spatial relation challenges, enhancing 3D visual grounding performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

*Sobhan Asasi,Mohamed Ilyes Lakhal,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical pre-training strategy for gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) improves translation quality by aligning pseudo-glosses and spoken sentences at multiple feature levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT methods face challenges in aligning visual and textual representations, with gloss-based and gloss-free approaches each having limitations.

Method: A hierarchical pre-training strategy extracts features at frame, segment, and video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and spoken sentences.

Result: The method improves BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical approach enhances gloss-free SLT by leveraging structured linguistic information and effective alignment.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical anomaly detection is challenging due to diverse imaging modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data.

Method: Uses visual adapters and prompt learning with POT and CL to align multiple prompts with local features for capturing subtle abnormalities. CL enhances intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios without synthetic data or memory banks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in medical anomaly detection, offering superior performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

*Guan Zheng,Xue Wang,Wenhua Qian,Peng Liu,Runzhuo Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPFNet is a novel image fusion method using residual priors and frequency-aware techniques to efficiently integrate complementary features while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image fusion lacks ground-truth and efficient global feature modeling, making complementary feature capture challenging.

Method: RPFNet uses a dual-branch framework: Residual Prior Module (RPM) for difference extraction and Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) for efficient global modeling. Cross Promotion Module (CPM) enhances local-global synergy. Training includes auxiliary decoder, saliency loss, and frequency contrastive loss.

Result: RPFNet effectively integrates features, enhances textures, and improves high-level vision task performance.

Conclusion: RPFNet addresses fusion challenges by combining residual priors and frequency-domain techniques, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

*Xinyu Xie,Weifeng Cao,Jun Shi,Yangyang Hu,Hui Liang,Wanyong Liang,Xiaoliang Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHDL, a specialized dataset for semiconductor wafer dicing, and DIFFUMA, a dual-path prediction model, achieving SOTA performance with a 39% MSE reduction and near-perfect SSIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmark datasets for high-precision industrial processes like semiconductor manufacturing limits research.

Method: Proposes DIFFUMA, a dual-path architecture combining a Mamba module for global context and a diffusion module for fine-grained details.

Result: DIFFUMA reduces MSE by 39% and improves SSIM to 0.988 on CHDL, also generalizing to natural datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides a SOTA model and a valuable dataset to advance industrial AI research.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

*Zishen Huang,Chunyu Yang,Mengyuan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PCA caching and DynCFGCache to improve video generation speed by adaptive reuse thresholds and dynamic CFG output selection, achieving 2.79x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-frequency caching degrades quality in complex scenes, and manual tuning is inefficient. Existing methods like TeaCache have limitations in input-output modeling.

Method: Introduces PCA caching for adaptive reuse based on prompt complexity and DynCFGCache for dynamic CFG output reuse. Enhances input modeling with multivariate polynomial feature expansion.

Result: Achieves 2.79x speedup on Wan2.1 model while maintaining visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively balance speed and quality in video generation by leveraging adaptive and dynamic caching strategies.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in SOTA models when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI views.

Method: Introduces FOLC-Net with MRFO for model structure, global model cloning for scalability, and ConvNeXt for adaptability. Evaluated on multi-view and individual MRI data.

Result: Achieves 92.44% accuracy in sagittal view, surpassing DL models (88.37%) and Residual Learning (88.95%).

Conclusion: FOLC-Net provides a robust, adaptable solution for decentralized medical image analysis, addressing SOTA limitations.

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-granularity identity association mechanism for weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, improving accuracy by addressing one-to-many identity relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex one-to-many identity relationships, limiting performance in weakly supervised text-to-person image matching.

Method: Uses local-and-global dual-granularity identity association: local cross-modal identity relationships and a global dynamic cross-modal network with confidence-based adjustment. Also employs asymmetric sample pairs and consistency learning.

Result: Significantly improves cross-modal matching accuracy, enhancing model robustness and sensitivity.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient solution for text-to-person image matching by addressing key challenges in weakly supervised learning.

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Motivation: Manchu, a critically endangered language, lacks effective OCR systems for historical documents, hindering digital humanities research.

Method: Fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using parameter-efficient training.

Conclusion: The work provides a cost-effective, transferable framework for endangered language OCR, enabling broader access to historical archives without specialized resources.

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for co-speech gesture video generation uses 2D skeletons and a diffusion model to align audio with visual outputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is challenging due to one-to-many audio-visual mappings, limited datasets, and high computational costs.

Method: Uses 2D skeletons as auxiliary conditions, a diffusion model for audio-skeleton fusion, and an off-the-shelf human video generator.

Result: Exceeds state-of-the-art in visual quality and synchronization, generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and scalable, supported by the new CSG-405 dataset.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic thermal aerial images to address the lack of diverse datasets, enhancing existing ones with new object classes like drones and animals. It demonstrates strong performance in object detection tasks, outperforming visible-light models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits deep learning advancements due to high data collection costs and logistical challenges.

Method: A novel procedural pipeline generates synthetic thermal images by integrating arbitrary object classes into existing thermal backgrounds, controlling position, scale, and orientation.

Result: Enhanced datasets (HIT-UAV and MONET) with new object classes show strong performance in object detection, with thermal detectors outperforming visible-light models.

Conclusion: The synthetic pipeline effectively expands thermal datasets, enabling new applications and demonstrating the superiority of thermal detectors in aerial tasks.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Motivation: Conventional field sampling lacks scalability for ecologically meaningful spatial scales, and hyperspectral data faces challenges like label scarcity and domain shifts.

Method: Uses GreenHyperSpectra dataset for pretraining, employing semi- and self-supervised methods to improve spectral representation learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art supervised baselines in trait prediction, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for plant trait prediction, advancing research in representation learning and functional trait assessment.

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Deliberate-to-Intuitive (D2I) framework to enhance multimodal reasoning in LLMs without extra annotations or complex rewards, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal reasoning in LLMs faces challenges like high training costs and limited scalability due to reliance on additional annotations and rule-based rewards.

Method: D2I uses deliberate reasoning strategies with rule-based format rewards during training, then shifts to intuitive reasoning during evaluation.

Result: D2I outperforms baselines on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating improved reasoning and alignment.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the effectiveness of format rewards for transferable reasoning skills and suggests decoupling training and test-time reasoning depth.

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new color space (HVI) and a network (HVI-CIDNet+) for low-light image enhancement, addressing color bias and noise artifacts while leveraging vision-language models for improved restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in sRGB and HSV color spaces suffer from color bias, brightness artifacts, and noise, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: Introduces the HVI color space to decouple brightness and color, and the HVI-CIDNet+ network with Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB) and Region Refinement Block for content restoration and color correction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 10 benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in low-light image enhancement.

Conclusion: The HVI color space and HVI-CIDNet+ effectively mitigate color distortion and noise artifacts, achieving high-quality low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework combines symbolic regression and trajectory-guided I2V models to improve physical alignment in video generation by discovering motion equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack accurate physical alignment due to reliance on statistical correlations, not physical laws.

Method: Extracts motion trajectories, uses retrieval-based pre-training for symbolic regression, and guides video generation with discovered equations.

Result: Recovers ground-truth motion equations and improves physical alignment in generated videos for Classical Mechanics scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances physical realism in video generation without fine-tuning existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Motivation: To address the challenge of WSSS by leveraging ViT's self-attention maps directly, avoiding reliance on external modules like Class Activation Maps.

Method: Trains a sparse ViT with multiple [CLS] tokens (one per class) using random masking. Aggregates self-attention maps of [CLS] tokens at inference to generate pseudo segmentation masks.

Result: Outperforms related works on standard benchmarks and specialized datasets, generating accurate pseudo-masks.

Conclusion: The method reduces dependency on fine-grained labeled data, achieving results comparable to fully-supervised models.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior adversarial patch methods lack stealth and contextual coherence, making them detectable by humans and defenses. IAP aims to address these limitations.

Method: IAP uses perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization, leveraging classwise localization, sensitivity maps, and a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss.

Result: IAP achieves high attack success rates with improved invisibility, outperforming baselines and bypassing state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: IAP is a highly effective and stealthy adversarial patch attack framework, advancing the field in targeted attack scenarios.

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-term stability and variability of biometric characteristics across diverse populations.

Method: Conducted over 2.5 years with 400+ participants using GDPR-compliant data and state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms.

Result: Comparison scores vary more between individual days than over the entire period.

Conclusion: Long-term, controlled testing is crucial for accurate biometric analysis and future advancements.

Abstract: This study presents findings from long-term biometric evaluations conducted
at the Biometric Evaluation Center (bez). Over the course of two and a half
years, our ongoing research with over 400 participants representing diverse
ethnicities, genders, and age groups were regularly assessed using a variety of
biometric tools and techniques at the controlled testing facilities. Our
findings are based on the General Data Protection Regulation-compliant local
bez database with more than 238.000 biometric data sets categorized into
multiple biometric modalities such as face and finger. We used state-of-the-art
face recognition algorithms to analyze long-term comparison scores. Our results
show that these scores fluctuate more significantly between individual days
than over the entire measurement period. These findings highlight the
importance of testing biometric characteristics of the same individuals over a
longer period of time in a controlled measurement environment and lays the
groundwork for future advancements in biometric data analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemRaFiner improves radar-based panoptic segmentation by optimizing feature extraction and training procedures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing semantic scene understanding for autonomous vehicles, especially in adverse weather, where cameras and LiDARs face limitations.

Method: SemRaFiner optimizes feature extraction for sparse radar point clouds and refines training with dedicated data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art radar-based panoptic segmentation methods.

Conclusion: SemRaFiner effectively improves radar-based scene understanding, addressing sparsity and noise challenges.

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

*Qiyuan Dai,Hanzhuo Huang,Yu Wu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APL introduces adaptive part discovery and learning for GCD, enhancing discriminability and generalization without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on global DINO CLS tokens, creating a trade-off between discriminability and generalization.

Method: APL uses shared part queries and DINO priors to discover object parts, employing an all-min contrastive loss for part representation.

Result: APL improves GCD performance on fine-grained datasets by replacing CLS token features with part representations.

Conclusion: APL effectively balances discriminability and generalization in GCD, offering a plug-and-play solution for existing frameworks.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

*Yixin Zhao,Yuyi Zhang,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCCD, a multi-attribute Chinese calligraphy dataset, addressing the scarcity of detailed calligraphy datasets and enabling diverse research tasks like character recognition and evolutionary studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calligraphy datasets lack attribute information, hindering in-depth study. The paper aims to fill this gap by providing a richly annotated dataset.

Method: The authors created MCCD, containing 329,715 calligraphy character images with multi-attribute annotations (script styles, dynasties, calligraphers). Benchmark experiments were conducted for recognition tasks.

Result: Recognition experiments showed increased difficulty due to stroke complexity and attribute interplay. MCCD successfully addresses dataset scarcity.

Conclusion: MCCD fills a critical gap in calligraphy research, offering a valuable resource for advancing studies in Chinese calligraphy and related fields.

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: A deep learning model identifies palm clusters in satellite imagery to estimate ancient human management areas, revealing larger ecological footprints than previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-term effects of ancient human management on Neotropical forests at high-resolution scales.

Method: Combines deep learning (for palm tree identification) and clustering algorithms (for palm clusters) on satellite imagery, applied to 765 km² of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia.

Result: Palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological sites, suggesting managed areas up to two orders of magnitude larger than archaeological evidence alone indicates.

Conclusion: Pre-Columbian populations influenced vegetation, fostering palm proliferation, and integrating AI with ecological data reveals fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CheXPO, a strategy for optimizing VLMs in medical applications, reduces hallucinations by combining confidence-similarity mining and counterfactual rationales, achieving significant performance gains with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs in medical applications suffer from hallucinations, and existing preference optimization methods face challenges like irrelevant samples, imbalanced data, and high annotation costs.

Method: CheXPO synthesizes a multi-task chest X-ray dataset, identifies hard examples via token-level confidence analysis, and uses similarity-based retrieval and counterfactual rationales for balanced preference optimization.

Result: CheXPO achieves an 8.93% performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance in clinical tasks.

Conclusion: CheXPO provides a scalable, interpretable solution for reducing hallucinations in VLMs for radiology applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

TL;DR: ProRSeg, a deep learning method for MR-MR registration, showed strong cross-domain performance for prostate cancer, enabling accurate contour propagation and dose accumulation in MRgART.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is crucial for contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART).

Method: ProRSeg, trained with 262 pairs of 3T MR scans using weighted segmentation consistency loss, was tested on same-, cross-, and mixed-domain datasets for contour propagation and dose accumulation.

Result: ProRSeg generalized well for bladder (DSCs 0.86-0.88) but was domain-dependent for rectum and CTV. Dose accumulation met coverage constraints for 83.3% of patients.

Conclusion: ProRSeg demonstrated reasonable multi-domain MR-MR registration performance and preliminary feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance.

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

TL;DR: Percep360 is a novel panoramic generation method for autonomous driving, focusing on coherence and controllability through LSDM and PPM, outperforming stitched images in quality and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires comprehensive 360° views, but current data acquisition is complex and limited by fixed dataset distributions. Percep360 aims to generate high-quality, controllable panoramic data.

Method: Uses Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM) for coherent generation and Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM) for controllability, addressing gaps in data distributions.

Result: Generated images outperform stitched images in quality metrics and enhance downstream tasks like BEV segmentation.

Conclusion: Percep360 advances panoramic generation for autonomous driving, offering improved quality and controllability.

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MassID45 dataset, combining DNA barcoding and high-resolution imaging for automatic classification of bulk insect samples, aiding large-scale ecological surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying unsorted bulk insect samples in ecological surveys, leveraging both molecular and imaging data for accurate taxonomic resolution and abundance estimation.

Method: Human annotators, aided by an AI tool, segmented and labeled over 17,000 specimens in bulk images, combining DNA barcodes with imaging data.

Result: The MassID45 dataset enables precise taxonomic classification and abundance estimation, advancing tiny object detection and instance segmentation.

Conclusion: This dataset bridges ecological and machine learning research, offering a scalable solution for rapid insect community characterization.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

TL;DR: FreeTTA is a training-free test-time adaptation method for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that enhances predictions by modeling test data distribution without relying on costly training or unrealistic data assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing domain shifts and distributional changes in VLMs during test-time adaptation, FreeTTA aims to improve flexibility and performance without costly processes or unrealistic data access.

Method: FreeTTA uses an online EM algorithm with zero-shot VLM predictions as priors to iteratively update posterior probabilities of test samples, leveraging intrinsic relationships among them.

Result: FreeTTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings, showing stable and significant improvements.

Conclusion: FreeTTA provides a practical, training-free solution for test-time adaptation in VLMs, advancing the field by explicitly modeling test data distribution and leveraging sample relationships.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Motivation: Automated vehicles' perception systems are vulnerable to sensor degradation in adverse weather. Collective perception can help, but its performance in such conditions is understudied.

Method: Proposed DenoiseCP-Net, a unified sparse convolution backbone for voxel-level noise filtering and object detection, tested on an extended OPV2V dataset with simulated adverse weather.

Result: Achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy, reduces bandwidth by 23.6%, maintains detection accuracy, and lowers inference latency.

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net effectively addresses adverse weather challenges in collective perception, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

TL;DR: MCA-RG is a knowledge-driven framework for radiology report generation that aligns visual features with medical concepts, improving accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of LLMs for RRG is hindered by inaccurate mapping of pathological/anatomical features to text and semantic agnostic feature extraction.

Method: MCA-RG uses curated pathology and anatomy banks, aligns visual features with medical concepts, employs contrastive learning, matching loss, and feature gating.

Result: MCA-RG outperforms benchmarks on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, demonstrating superior RRG performance.

Conclusion: MCA-RG effectively enhances radiology report generation by aligning visual features with medical concepts, addressing key clinical challenges.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

TL;DR: A novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion improves survival prediction in NSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy by combining 3D CT images and clinical data using a cross-modality masked learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prognosis for NSCLC patients on immunotherapy is crucial for personalized treatment but is hindered by limited datasets and ineffective multi-modal feature fusion.

Method: Proposes a cross-modality masked learning framework with a Slice-Depth Transformer for CT images and a graph-based Transformer for clinical data, using masked modality learning to enhance feature integration.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in survival prediction, setting a new benchmark for prognostic models in NSCLC.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses challenges in multi-modal feature fusion, improving prognosis accuracy for NSCLC immunotherapy patients.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Motivation: Accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment rely on microscopic assessment of histopathology images. However, challenges like redundant patches and lack of automatic captioning hinder progress in computer-aided pathology.

Method: The GNN-ViTCap framework extracts patch embeddings, removes redundancy via deep embedded clustering and attention, constructs a graph for context, and fine-tunes a language model for captioning.

Result: GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934, AUC of 0.963 for classification, and BLEU-4 of 0.811, METEOR of 0.569 for captioning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap provides a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy-based diagnosis, advancing computer-aided pathology.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

*Yutong Sun,Sichen Zhu,Peng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight method predicts cellular composition from H&E-stained histology images using pre-trained pathology foundation models, avoiding costly spatial transcriptomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage digital pathology and deep learning for predicting cell-type compositions without expensive spatial transcriptomics.

Method: Uses pre-trained pathology foundation models to extract features, then trains a lightweight MLP regressor on cell-type abundances.

Result: Competitive performance with existing methods like Hist2Cell, while reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently predicts cell-type compositions from histology images, offering a cost-effective alternative to spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

### [157] [MST-Distill: Mixture of Specialized Teachers for Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07015)
*Hui Li,Pengfei Yang,Juanyang Chen,Le Dong,Yanxin Chen,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MST-Distill is a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework using specialized teachers and dynamic routing to address distillation path selection and knowledge drift, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional distillation methods struggle in cross-modal settings due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage complementary knowledge from cross-modal teacher models.

Method: Proposes MST-Distill with a mixture of specialized teachers, dynamic routing, and a plug-in masking module to suppress discrepancies and reconstruct teacher representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five diverse multimodal datasets (visual, audio, text).

Conclusion: MST-Distill effectively addresses cross-modal distillation challenges, enhancing knowledge transfer and performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

### [158] [An AI Approach for Learning the Spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07073)
*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometric deep learning framework predicts the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) spectrum efficiently from CAD meshes, reducing computation time by 5x compared to FEM while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The FEM method for estimating the LB spectrum is inefficient for large CAD databases or frequent quality control tasks, necessitating a faster solution.

Method: A Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture uses mesh features like Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, and principal curvatures to predict the LB spectrum.

Result: The method achieves a 5x speedup over FEM with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The LB spectrum is learnable, and the proposed GNN framework offers a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

### [159] [Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Nutrition Analysis: A Benchmark Enriched with Contextual Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07048)
*Bruce Coburn,Jiangpeng He,Megan E. Rollo,Satvinder S. Dhaliwal,Deborah A. Kerr,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how contextual metadata (GPS, timestamps, food items) enhances LMM performance in nutrition analysis, introduces the ACETADA dataset, and shows improved accuracy with reasoning modifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on proprietary models like GPT-4, leaving other LLMs underexplored, and lacks investigation into contextual metadata's role in nutrition analysis.

Method: Evaluates eight LMMs (four open, four closed) using contextual metadata (location, meal type) and reasoning modifiers (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, etc.) on the ACETADA dataset.

Result: Contextual metadata integration reduces MAE and MAPE in nutritional value predictions, enhancing LMM performance.

Conclusion: Context-aware LMMs show promise for improved nutrition analysis, with metadata and reasoning modifiers playing key roles.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

*Yimu Pan,Manas Mehta,Gwen Sincerbeaux,Jeffery A. Goldstein,Alison D. Gernand,James Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RulerNet is a deep learning framework for robustly inferring real-world scale from images by treating ruler reading as a keypoint-detection problem, using geometric-progression parameters for invariance to perspective. It outperforms traditional methods and works in diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pixel-to-real-world conversion is critical for applications like biomedicine and forensics but remains challenging. Existing methods are rigid or rely on handcrafted thresholds, limiting generalization.

Method: RulerNet reformulates ruler reading as keypoint detection with geometric-progression parameters. It uses a synthetic-data pipeline for training diversity and DeepGP for real-time parameter regression.

Result: RulerNet achieves accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimation under diverse real-world conditions, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: RulerNet is a generalizable, scalable solution for automated measurement, with potential for integration into vision systems for high-impact domains.

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

### [161] [Evaluating Attribute Confusion in Fashion Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07079)
*Ziyue Liu,Federico Girella,Yiming Wang,Davide Talon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces L-VQAScore, a novel metric for evaluating Text-to-Image (T2I) models, addressing limitations in assessing entity-attribute semantics by combining visual localization and VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I evaluation methods struggle with attribute confusion, where attributes are correctly depicted but misassociated with entities, especially in complex domains like fashion.

Method: The authors propose a localized evaluation protocol and L-VQAScore, which uses visual localization and VQA to probe correct and miss-localized attribute generation.

Result: L-VQAScore outperforms existing methods in correlating with human judgments on a challenging dataset, demonstrating its ability to capture fine-grained entity-attribute associations.

Conclusion: L-VQAScore is presented as a reliable, scalable alternative to subjective evaluations for T2I models.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MotionMillion, the largest human motion dataset, and a benchmark for zero-shot text-to-motion generation, achieving strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in zero-shot generalization and lack of evaluation frameworks in text-to-motion generation.

Method: Developed an annotation pipeline, created MotionMillion dataset, proposed MotionMillion-Eval benchmark, and scaled a model to 7B parameters.

Result: Demonstrated strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex motions.

Conclusion: A significant advancement toward zero-shot human motion generation.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

*Tiezheng Zhang,Yitong Li,Yu-cheng Chou,Jieneng Chen,Alan Yuille,Chen Wei,Junfei Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the VLV auto-encoder framework, leveraging pretrained models to build cost-efficient VLMs with strong captioning capabilities, reducing data and computational needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and data requirements of training VLMs by utilizing existing pretrained models and minimizing paired image-text datasets.

Method: The VLV framework uses a vision encoder, T2I diffusion decoder, and LLM, regularizing the language space and fine-tuning the LLM for captioning.

Result: Achieves SoTA captioning performance comparable to GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, with training costs under $1,000 USD.

Conclusion: The VLV framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-quality VLMs, reducing reliance on massive datasets.

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

TL;DR: 4KAgent is a unified system for upscaling any image to 4K resolution, handling severe degradations, and enhancing facial details. It uses profiling, perception, and restoration agents, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile, high-quality image upscaling system that can handle diverse inputs and tasks, pushing the boundaries of low-level vision tasks.

Method: The system combines profiling, a perception agent (using vision-language models and quality assessment), and a restoration agent (recursive execution-reflection with a quality-driven policy).

Result: Achieves superior performance on 26 benchmarks across 11 categories, excelling in perceptual and fidelity metrics.

Conclusion: 4KAgent introduces a novel agentic paradigm for low-level vision, encouraging innovation in vision-centric autonomous agents.

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at
256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three
core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using text-to-image diffusion models as visual encoders for MLLMs, finding they offer richer semantics and better alignment than CLIP, but identifies and mitigates a leakage issue with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs rely on CLIP for visual encoding, which lacks fine-grained detail. The study investigates if diffusion models can improve this by capturing more relevant visual information.

Method: Analyzes diffusion model features for semantics and alignment, identifies leakage in LLM integration, proposes mitigation, and tests a fusion of CLIP and diffusion features.

Result: Diffusion models enhance visual understanding, especially for tasks needing spatial and compositional reasoning, outperforming CLIP in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show promise as visual encoders for MLLMs, offering better detail and alignment, though leakage issues require careful handling.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance in coding and reasoning, with enhanced multimodal understanding. The models span a range of capabilities and cost efficiencies.

Conclusion: The Gemini 2.X models provide a comprehensive solution for agentic workflows, balancing performance and cost across diverse applications.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute

### [167] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)
*Neil Rathi,Dan Jurafsky,Kaitlyn Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit linguistic overconfidence across languages, with varying reliance behaviors, highlighting risks of multilingual misalignment and the need for culturally aware safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risks of linguistic miscalibration and overreliance on LLMs in a global context, given differences in epistemic marker usage across languages.

Method: Analyzed LLM-generated epistemic markers in five languages and measured human reliance rates on confident and uncertain generations.

Result: LLMs are overconfident cross-linguistically but sensitive to linguistic variation. Human reliance on confident generations is high, with differences across languages (e.g., higher reliance on uncertainty in Japanese).

Conclusion: Multilingual linguistic calibration is challenging, emphasizing the need for culturally and linguistically contextualized safety evaluations of LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

### [168] [ETT: Expanding the Long Context Understanding Capability of LLMs at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06313)
*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT (Extend at Test-Time) is a method to extend context length in Transformer-based LLMs with linear computation and constant memory, improving accuracy by up to 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic computation and memory overhead in Transformer-based LLMs limit their use for long sequences.

Method: ETT fine-tunes model parameters on overlapping subsequences of the input context, focusing on specific Transformer modules like the second FFN layer.

Result: ETT extends context length up to 32 times (1k to 32k tokens) and improves accuracy by up to 30%.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning specific modules (e.g., second FFN layer) is more effective than full fine-tuning, enhancing model performance for long sequences.

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

### [169] [Could the Road to Grounded, Neuro-symbolic AI be Paved with Words-as-Classifiers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06335)
*Casey Kennington,David Schlangen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes unifying formal, distributional, and grounded semantic theories using the words-as-classifiers model, supported by cognitive science and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of individual semantic theories (formal, distributional, grounded) by integrating them through the words-as-classifiers model.

Method: Review of literature, cognitive science insights, and a small experiment to validate the words-as-classifiers approach.

Result: The words-as-classifiers model shows promise in unifying semantic theories and has been tested in interactive dialogue settings.

Conclusion: A unified semantic model based on words-as-classifiers is feasible and beneficial, bridging gaps between existing theories.

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

### [170] [Evaluating Morphological Alignment of Tokenizers in 70 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06378)
*Catherine Arnett,Marisa Hudspeth,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper expands MorphScore to evaluate tokenizer quality across 70 languages and finds that morphological alignment alone does not significantly impact model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clear methods for evaluating tokenizer quality, particularly focusing on how well tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords.

Method: Expands MorphScore to 70 languages, evaluates tokenizer alignment with morphological boundaries, and correlates these scores with downstream task performance.

Result: Morphological alignment scores do not explain much variance in model performance, indicating limited relevance to tokenizer quality for model tasks.

Conclusion: Morphological alignment alone is insufficient for measuring tokenizer quality in terms of model performance.

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

### [171] [Hypermagmas and Colored Operads: Heads, Phases, and Theta Roles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06393)
*Matilde Marcolli,Riny Huijbregts,Richard K. Larson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends syntactic structures to hypermagmas and colored operads, linking head functions, c-command, and m-command relations. It reformulates syntactic rules and movement constraints using colored operads and hypermagmas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify syntactic structures (head functions, c-command, m-command) with algebraic frameworks (hypermagmas, colored operads) and simplify syntactic rules.

Method: Formulate syntactic structures as hypermagmas and colored operads, then relate them to Merge operations and movement constraints.

Result: Syntactic rules (e.g., movement, phase conditions) are subsumed into colored operad generators, linking them to hypermagma structures.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified algebraic approach to syntactic structures and movement constraints, simplifying their formulation.

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

### [172] [PERK: Long-Context Reasoning as Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06415)
*Zeming Chen,Angelika Romanou,Gail Weiss,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge) is a scalable method for encoding long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight adapter, outperforming prompt-based baselines in long-context reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory-intensive limitations of meta-learning methods for test-time learning in long-context reasoning.

Method: Uses two nested optimization loops: an inner loop to encode contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) and an outer loop to learn reasoning over the encoded context.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains (up to 90% for GPT-2 and 27% for Qwen-2.5-0.5B) and robustness in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PERK is efficient at inference and scalable, though memory-intensive during training.

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

### [173] [Reward Models Can Improve Themselves: Reward-Guided Adversarial Failure Mode Discovery for Robust Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06419)
*Pankayaraj Pathmanathan,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes REFORM, a self-improving reward modeling framework to enhance robustness by generating adversarial examples for training data augmentation, improving alignment without sacrificing reward quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial perturbations due to the complexity of human preferences and limited dataset coverage. Existing methods rely on prior knowledge, limiting practicality.

Method: The authors introduce a preference-distribution agnostic method for discovering failure modes via reward-guided controlled decoding. REFORM uses the reward model to generate falsely scored responses for data augmentation.

Result: Evaluated on Anthropic HH and PKU Beavertails datasets, REFORM significantly improves robustness while preserving reward quality and alignment in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: REFORM effectively patches reward model misalignment by leveraging adversarial examples, enhancing robustness and alignment quality without compromising performance.

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

*Shun Wang,Tyler Loakman,Youbo Lei,Yi Liu,Bohao Yang,Yuting Zhao,Dong Yang,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dictionary-learning method with sparse autoencoders to decompose LLMs, improving interpretability and performance on tasks like math and metaphor detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are often seen as black-box systems, reducing trust and limiting performance optimization. This work aims to address these issues by making LLMs more interpretable.

Method: The authors use a dictionary-learning approach with sparse autoencoders to decompose LLMs, extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic neurons.

Result: The method identifies model-internal misunderstandings and improves prompt interpretation, leading to significant performance gains in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Decomposing LLMs with this approach enhances interpretability and task performance, offering a practical solution to black-box limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

### [175] [Temporal Analysis of Climate Policy Discourse: Insights from Dynamic Embedded Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06435)
*Rafiu Adekoya Badekale,Adewale Akinfaderin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse, revealing shifts in themes over time from greenhouse gases to implementation and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding policy language evolution is crucial for assessing global responses to challenges like climate change, but traditional methods like manual coding are inefficient.

Method: The study applies DETM to UNFCCC policy decisions (1995-2023), excluding 2020, to capture temporal topic dynamics.

Result: DETM effectively identifies thematic shifts, such as from greenhouse gases to implementation and finance, proving scalable for policy discourse analysis.

Conclusion: DETM is a promising tool for policy analysis, with potential applications in other domains, though future refinements are needed.

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

*Zhenhailong Wang,Xuehang Guo,Sofia Stoica,Haiyang Xu,Hongru Wang,Hyeonjeong Ha,Xiusi Chen,Yangyi Chen,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAPO extends RLVR to improve multimodal reasoning by integrating perception learning, achieving significant performance gains without extra data or models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods underperform in multimodal tasks due to poor visual perception, which PAPO aims to address.

Method: PAPO adds an Implicit Perception Loss (KL divergence) to GRPO, enhancing perception and reasoning jointly.

Result: PAPO improves performance by 4.4% overall and up to 8.0% in vision-dependent tasks, reducing perception errors by 30.5%.

Conclusion: PAPO advances RLVR by integrating perception-aware supervision, enabling better visually grounded reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

### [177] [A Semantic Parsing Framework for End-to-End Time Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06450)
*Xin Su,Sungduk Yu,Phillip Howard,Steven Bethard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to time normalization by framing it as a code generation task using the SCATE framework, enabling executable temporal semantics. It leverages LLMs for data augmentation and shows improved performance with smaller, deployable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time normalization systems are limited in handling complex temporal expressions, prompting the need for a more expressive and accurate method.

Method: The work formulates time normalization as code generation using the SCATE framework, implements a Python library, and uses LLMs for data augmentation and validation.

Result: Small models trained on augmented data outperform LLMs, achieving practical, accurate, and interpretable time normalization.

Conclusion: The SCATE framework and LLM-augmented data enable efficient and deployable time normalization systems, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

*Dustin Wang,Rui-Jie Zhu,Steven Abreu,Yong Shan,Taylor Kergan,Yuqi Pan,Yuhong Chou,Zheng Li,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates linear attention models in hybrid architectures, finding that superior standalone models don't always perform well in hybrids. Optimal hybrid performance requires specific gating and recurrence mechanisms, with a recommended linear-to-full attention ratio of 3:1 to 6:1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with long sequences due to quadratic complexity, leading to the adoption of linear attention. However, linear models often underperform in recall, prompting the need for hybrid architectures.

Method: The study systematically evaluates six linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios, training 72 models (340M and 1.3B parameters) on language modeling and recall tasks.

Result: Language modeling remains stable across ratios, but recall improves with more full attention layers, especially below a 3:1 ratio. Selective gating and hierarchical recurrence are key for effective hybrids.

Conclusion: Hybrid models with HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet and a 3:1 to 6:1 linear-to-full ratio achieve efficient Transformer-level recall. All models are open-sourced.

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

TL;DR: The paper studies the robustness of verbal confidence in LLMs under adversarial attacks, showing vulnerabilities and ineffective defenses, urging the need for better confidence mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring robust verbal confidence in LLMs is critical for transparency, trust, and safety in high-stakes human-AI interactions.

Method: A novel framework for attacking verbal confidence via perturbation and jailbreak methods, tested across prompting strategies, model sizes, and domains.

Result: Attacks significantly undermine confidence estimates, causing frequent answer changes; current defenses are ineffective.

Conclusion: Urgent need for more robust confidence mechanisms in LLMs, as even minor semantic changes can mislead confidence.

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel approach for translating puns from English to French using large language models and specialized wordplay techniques, achieving top results in a competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of translating wordplay, which confounds both human and machine translation, by capturing linguistic creativity and humor.

Method: A three-stage approach: baseline with large language models, guided chain-of-thought pipeline, and a generator-discriminator framework for pun evaluation.

Result: Top performance in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition, evaluated by native French speakers.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of leveraging language models for wordplay translation, bridging translation studies and computational linguistics.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

TL;DR: SpindleKV is a novel KV cache reduction method for LLMs, balancing shallow and deep layers with attention-weight eviction and codebook-based replacement, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing memory consumption of KV cache in LLMs poses a challenge, with existing methods insufficient for shallow layers.

Method: SpindleKV uses attention-weight eviction for deep layers and a codebook-based replacement for shallow layers, addressing GQA issues.

Result: Experiments show SpindleKV achieves better KV cache reduction while maintaining or improving model performance.

Conclusion: SpindleKV effectively reduces KV cache redundancy across layers, offering a balanced solution for LLM inference systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

TL;DR: InvestAlign is a framework for aligning LLMs with investor decision-making under herd behavior by generating synthetic SFT datasets from theoretical solutions, improving efficiency and reducing reliance on real-user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aligning LLMs with investor behavior under herd behavior is hindered by the scarcity of real-user data for SFT, which is costly and privacy-sensitive.

Method: InvestAlign constructs high-quality SFT datasets using theoretical solutions to simple optimal investment problems instead of complex real-user data.

Result: LLMs trained with InvestAlign data achieve faster convergence and closer alignment to real-user behavior than pre-SFT models, as demonstrated by InvestAgent.

Conclusion: InvestAlign offers a promising solution for aligning LLMs with investor decision-making, addressing data scarcity and efficiency issues in behavioral finance.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient and accurate information extraction from complex industrial contracts.

Method: Cluster analysis, GPT-4/GPT-3.5 for annotation, data augmentation via keyword-generated texts, and fine-tuning a large language model with LoRA and balancing techniques.

Result: High field recall, precision, and parsing efficiency, with enhanced model accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient solution for industrial contract information extraction, leveraging GPT models and fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a discursive-network model to analyze interactions between humans and LLMs, identifying invalidation hazards and proposing peer review to enhance reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the reliability of human-LLM interactions by modeling them as discursive networks and addressing invalidation hazards.

Method: Develops a mathematical model of discursive networks, identifies four invalidation hazards, and proposes the FOO algorithm for peer review.

Result: Networks with drift and self-repair stabilize at modest error rates; fabrication increases errors, while peer review shifts systems toward truth.

Conclusion: Reliability in human-LLM interactions depends on networked peer review rather than perfecting individual models.

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

Motivation: To enhance reliability and diversity in food QA by integrating structured knowledge and multimodal generation.

Method: Joint fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large, augmented by a large-scale MMKG and generative templates.

Result: Improvements include a 16.2% BERTScore increase, 37.8% FID reduction, and 31.1% CLIP alignment boost.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge and multimodal generation significantly improve food QA reliability and diversity.

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%

*Liliang Ren,Congcong Chen,Haoran Xu,Young Jin Kim,Adam Atkinson,Zheng Zhan,Jiankai Sun,Baolin Peng,Liyuan Liu,Shuohang Wang,Hao Cheng,Jianfeng Gao,Weizhu Chen,Yelong Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gated Memory Unit (GMU) for efficient memory sharing in State Space Models, leading to the SambaY architecture, which improves decoding efficiency and long-context performance without positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works overlooked the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers, prompting the development of GMU to address this gap.

Method: The GMU mechanism is applied to create SambaY, a hybrid architecture combining Samba and YOCO, enabling memory sharing across layers.

Result: SambaY enhances decoding efficiency, maintains linear pre-filling time, and outperforms baselines like YOCO, with significant gains in reasoning tasks and throughput.

Conclusion: The GMU and SambaY architecture demonstrate superior scalability and performance, validated by extensive experiments and open-source release.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We
release our training codebase on open-source data at

*Boshko Koloski,Senja Pollak,Roberto Navigli,Blaž Škrlj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuDoBa combines LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific knowledge using Bayesian optimization, creating efficient, interpretable, and high-performing document representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional LLM embeddings are often too generic or inefficient for domain-specific tasks, prompting the need for a more tailored solution.

Method: FuDoBa integrates LLM embeddings with domain-specific knowledge via Bayesian optimization, producing low-dimensional, task-relevant representations.

Result: The method matches or outperforms proprietary LLM-based embeddings on six datasets across two domains.

Conclusion: FuDoBa offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient alternative to pure LLM embeddings for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

*James Stewart-Evans,Emma Wilson,Tessa Langley,Andrew Prayle,Angela Hands,Karen Exley,Jo Leonardi-Bee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study tested Claude 3.5 Sonnet for data extraction in scoping reviews, finding high accuracy for simple tasks but poor performance for complex data. Precision was high, but recall and F1 scores were low. LLM feedback improved protocol adaptation but detected few errors. Robust evaluation is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expedite resource-intensive data extraction in reviews using LLMs and review protocols.

Method: Used Claude 3.5 Sonnet with two extraction approaches on 10 evidence sources, evaluated performance, and tested LLM feedback on protocol adaptation.

Result: High accuracy for simple data (83.3%-100%), low for complex data (9.6%-15.8%). Precision >90%, recall <25%, F1 <40%. LLM feedback improved protocol but detected few errors.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist but require robust evaluation. Researchers should assess and report performance when using LLMs for data extraction or review.

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

### [189] [Elite Polarization in European Parliamentary Speeches: a Novel Measurement Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06658)
*Gennadii Iakovlev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based method to measure elite polarization by analyzing politicians' mentions of each other in speeches, assessing emotional tone, and creating an index of mutual hostility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify elite polarization by tracking how politicians evaluate out-parties in parliamentary speeches, providing insights into political dynamics.

Method: Uses AI to detect actors and subjects in speeches, identifies speakers and addressees, and assesses emotional tone to create a polarization index.

Result: The index shows validity by reacting to events like elections, crises, and power shifts, with data aggregated by party and quarter for the UK, Hungary, and Italy.

Conclusion: The approach enables a scalable, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization, offering a tool for analyzing political hostility trends.

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

### [190] [CLI-RAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Clinically Structured and Context Aware Text Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06715)
*Garapati Keerthana,Manik Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLI-RAG is a framework for structured clinical text generation using LLMs, addressing challenges of unstructured data and long notes with hierarchical chunking and dual-stage retrieval. It outperforms baselines in alignment and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical applications of LLMs face challenges with unstructured, heterogeneous patient data and long, dense notes, making naive prompting ineffective.

Method: CLI-RAG uses hierarchical chunking and a dual-stage retrieval mechanism (global for note types, local for content) to generate structured clinical notes.

Result: The system achieved 87.7% alignment score, outperforming the 80.7% baseline from clinician notes, with high consistency across LLMs.

Conclusion: CLI-RAG improves clinical text generation by ensuring structured, relevant outputs, enhancing reproducibility and trust in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

### [191] [On the Effect of Uncertainty on Layer-wise Inference Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06722)
*Sunwoo Kim,Haneul Yoo,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how uncertainty in LLMs affects their inference dynamics, finding that certain and uncertain predictions follow similar probability trajectories across layers, challenging simplistic uncertainty detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how uncertainty in LLMs influences their internal processing and whether it affects inference dynamics, aiming to improve uncertainty detection and prevent hallucinations.

Method: The Tuned Lens (a variant of the Logit Lens) is used to analyze layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens across 11 datasets and 5 models, focusing on incorrect predictions as proxies for higher uncertainty.

Result: Certain and uncertain predictions show aligned probability trajectories, with abrupt confidence increases at similar layers, though more competent models may process uncertainty differently.

Conclusion: Simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty during inference may not be feasible, and interpretability tools like the Tuned Lens can reveal how uncertainty impacts model behavior.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of KAConvText in diverse sentence classification tasks, including hate speech detection, news classification, and language identification.

Method: Investigates embedding configurations (random vs. fastText, static vs. fine-tuned) and classification heads (MLP vs. KAN), comparing KAConvText to CNN and CNN-KAN baselines.

Result: KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves top performance: 91.23% accuracy (hate speech), 92.66% (news), and 99.82% (language ID).

Conclusion: KAConvText, especially with MLP heads and fine-tuned embeddings, is highly effective for sentence classification across tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

TL;DR: CE-Judge is a training-free framework using checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with open-source LLMs, outperforming baselines and matching GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of exploration in multilingual contexts for LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms, especially with cost and efficiency concerns.

Method: Proposes Checklist Engineering (CE-Judge), a training-free framework leveraging checklist intuition for evaluation with open-source models.

Result: Outperforms baselines and performs comparably to GPT-4o across multiple languages and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CE-Judge offers a cost-effective, efficient, and adaptable solution for multilingual text evaluation.

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

TL;DR: DACP improves small LLMs for enterprise use, balancing performance and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in deploying large-scale LLMs by validating DACP for small LLMs in commercial settings.

Method: Apply Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) to diverse foundation models and service domains.

Result: DACP-applied sLLMs show significant performance gains in target domains while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: DACP offers a scalable, cost-efficient solution for enterprise LLM deployment.

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

*Matthew Anderson Hendricks,Alice Cicirello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy for automating the generation of dynamical system computational models using SysML diagrams, NLP, and LLMs, demonstrating improved performance over LLM-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To speed up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by leveraging domain knowledge and automation.

Method: A five-step strategy using SysML diagrams, NLP, and LLMs for tasks like key noun extraction, relationship identification, and code generation.

Result: Improved performance in generating computational models, illustrated through case studies like a simple pendulum.

Conclusion: The approach is versatile and outperforms LLM-only methods, applicable across domains and systems.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flexible test-time collaborative inference framework combining sequential and parallel reasoning, introducing semantic entropy (SE) to dynamically assess and control reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and limitations in current sequential and parallel reasoning paradigms for scaling inference in large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduces semantic entropy (SE) to quantify semantic diversity of parallel responses, enabling dynamic control and early termination.

Result: SE serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality, negatively correlating with accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework leverages complementary strengths of sequential and parallel reasoning, improving efficiency and accuracy in LLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SETR improves RAG by selecting passages collectively for complex queries, outperforming existing rerankers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reranking methods fail to meet the needs of complex queries in multi-hop QA, requiring a more comprehensive approach.

Method: SETR uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to identify query requirements and selects optimal passage sets.

Result: SETR outperforms proprietary and open-source baselines in answer correctness and retrieval quality.

Conclusion: SETR offers an efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

Conclusion: AI evaluations require unique practices beyond traditional software development to ensure effectiveness and reliability.

Abstract: AI evaluations have become critical tools for assessing large language model
capabilities and safety. This paper presents practical insights from eight
months of maintaining $inspect\_evals$, an open-source repository of 70+
community-contributed AI evaluations. We identify key challenges in
implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community
contributions, (2) statistical methodologies for optimal resampling and
cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoRE is a modular, cost-effective RE system for KG enrichment, using contrastive learning and Bayesian kNN for robust performance. It introduces new metrics (CSD, P@R) and a benchmark dataset (Wiki20d), outperforming state-of-the-art methods with lower energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for adaptable, noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate with PLMs under low-supervision settings.

Method: Combines supervised contrastive learning with Bayesian kNN for multi-label classification, avoids finetuning, and allows easy PLM switching.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods on five benchmarks, reduces energy consumption, and performs well despite noisy annotations.

Conclusion: SCoRE's minimal design offers efficiency, modularity, and scalability, making it ideal for real-world RE applications.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

TL;DR: GUI agents using LVLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks via visual grounding, demonstrated by the VisualTrap method, which hijacks grounding with minimal poisoned data and stealthy triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The close integration of GUI agents with personal devices introduces unexplored security risks, particularly backdoor attacks targeting visual grounding.

Method: Proposes VisualTrap, a method to hijack visual grounding by injecting poisoned data during pre-training, misleading agents to incorrect GUI elements.

Result: VisualTrap succeeds with just 5% poisoned data and stealthy triggers, generalizing across tasks and GUI environments even after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical security risks in GUI agents, urging further research on backdoor attack vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

*Ziyan Liu,Chunxiao Fan,Haoran Lou,Yuexin Wu,Kaiwei Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIND is a zero-shot harmful meme detection framework using multi-agent strategies, outperforming existing methods without annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting evolving harmful memes without up-to-date annotated data.

Method: Uses retrieval of similar memes, bi-directional insight derivation, and multi-agent debate for robust detection.

Result: Outperforms zero-shot approaches and generalizes well across datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: MIND provides a scalable, annotation-free solution for harmful meme detection.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is

*Xiao Wang,Jiahuan Pei,Diancheng Shui,Zhiguang Han,Xin Sun,Dawei Zhu,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (MPMCP) to evaluate legal LLMs on multi-defendant and multi-charge scenarios, finding S4 (multiple defendants and charges) most challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether multiple defendants and charges should be treated separately in legal judgment prediction (LJP).

Method: Created MPMCP dataset and tested legal LLMs (e.g., InternLM2, Lawformer) on four scenarios (S1-S4) for charge and penalty term prediction.

Result: S4 was hardest, with performance drops (e.g., Lawformer: 19.7% lower F1-score, 19.0% higher LogD vs. S1).

Conclusion: Multi-defendant/charge scenarios significantly impact LJP performance, with S4 posing the greatest challenge.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

### [203] [Exploring LLMs for Predicting Tutor Strategy and Student Outcomes in Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06910)
*Fareya Ikram,Alexander Scarlatos,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs (Llama 3 and GPT-4o) to predict tutor strategies and student outcomes in tutoring dialogues, finding current models inadequate for strategy prediction despite its importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tutoring dialogues are crucial in online learning, and tutor strategies impact student outcomes, yet predicting these strategies is understudied.

Method: The study evaluates modern LLMs (Llama 3 and GPT-4o) on two math tutoring dialogue datasets to predict tutor moves and student outcomes.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle to predict tutor strategies, though these strategies strongly influence student outcomes.

Conclusion: More advanced methods are needed to effectively predict tutor strategies and their impact on students.

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

*Zihan Ma,Taolin Zhang,Maosong Cao,Wenwei Zhang,Minnan Luo,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in current code-generation benchmarks for LLMs by proposing a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA) to improve test-case quality and coverage, validated by higher detection and verifier accuracy rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM code-generation are limited and homogeneous, leading to undetected faults and inflated performance metrics, which affect reinforcement learning frameworks.

Method: The authors introduce multi-dimensional metrics for test-suite thoroughness and propose SAGA, a human-LLM collaborative method, to enhance test-case generation. They also develop TCGBench for evaluation.

Result: SAGA achieves a 90.62% detection rate and 32.58% verifier accuracy, outperforming LiveCodeBench-v6 by 10.78% in verifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The work aims to improve LLM code evaluation reliability, advance RLVR in code generation, and enable automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

*Sezen Perçin,Xin Su,Qutub Sha Syed,Phillip Howard,Aleksei Kuvshinov,Leo Schwinn,Kay-Ulrich Scholl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are sensitive to query perturbations, revealing performance degradation under minor variations. It proposes an evaluation framework and practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are costly to update, and RAG offers a dynamic solution, but its effectiveness depends heavily on query quality.

Method: The study analyzes RAG pipeline components' sensitivity to query perturbations, testing in isolation and end-to-end QA settings across general and domain-specific datasets.

Result: Performance of retrievers degrades significantly with minor query variations, as shown in over 1092 experiments.

Conclusion: The paper provides an evaluation framework for RAG robustness and actionable insights for practitioners.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the detection and labeling of how entities are framed in narratives, aiding media analysts in understanding portrayals across sources.

Method: A two-stage system combining sequence labeling and fine-grained role classification, using a taxonomy of 22 roles under protagonists, antagonists, or innocents.

Result: FRaN-X supports five languages and two domains, offers interactive analysis tools, and is publicly accessible with trained models under an MIT License.

Conclusion: FRaN-X effectively aids in analyzing and comparing entity framing in narratives, providing valuable tools for media analysts.

Abstract: We present FRaN-X, a Framing and Narratives Explorer that automatically
detects entity mentions and classifies their narrative roles directly from raw
text. FRaN-X comprises a two-stage system that combines sequence labeling with
fine-grained role classification to reveal how entities are portrayed as
protagonists, antagonists, or innocents, using a unique taxonomy of 22
fine-grained roles nested under these three main categories. The system

and two domains (the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Climate Change). It provides
an interactive web interface for media analysts to explore and compare framing
across different sources, tackling the challenge of automatically detecting and
labeling how entities are framed. Our system allows end users to focus on a
single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained
models are licensed under an MIT License. FRaN-X is publicly accessible at

TL;DR: FlexOlmo is a language model supporting distributed training without data sharing and flexible inference, using a mixture-of-experts architecture. It improves performance by 41% while respecting data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training LMs on closed datasets without sharing data, while enabling flexible inference to respect data owners' preferences.

Method: Uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with independently trained experts on closed datasets, integrated via domain-informed routing.

Result: Achieves 41% relative improvement over baselines, outperforms prior merging methods by 10.1%, and matches standard MoE performance.

Conclusion: FlexOlmo offers a privacy-respecting solution for leveraging closed data, benefiting regulated industries and data owners.

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified model combining dense retrieval and response generation in conversational search systems outperforms existing baselines by jointly fine-tuning and addressing inconsistency risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational search systems use separate models, limiting their ability to leverage intrinsic knowledge simultaneously and ensure retrieval effectiveness for generation.

Method: Joint fine-tuning with different objectives and two mechanisms to reduce inconsistency risks and mitigate data discrepancy.

Result: Evaluations on five datasets show mutual improvement in both tasks and superior performance over baselines.

Conclusion: The unified model effectively combines retrieval and generation, enhancing conversational search systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

### [209] [Discrete Diffusion Models for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07050)
*Ashen Weligalle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores discrete diffusion models (D3PM) for natural language generation, comparing them with autoregressive models (AR). D3PM shows faster processing but lower compression efficiency than AR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel in continuous data but face challenges in discrete data like language due to token dependencies and lack of generation order. This work investigates their feasibility for language generation.

Method: Evaluates D3PM and AR models using metrics like Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed. Tests involve generating 100,000 tokens per model with a fixed batch size.

Result: D3PM achieves a BPT of 5.72 (mean 8.05) and faster processing (3.97 batches/sec). AR outperforms in compression (mean BPT 4.59) but is slower.

Conclusion: D3PM shows promise for parallel generation but lags in compression. The study highlights trade-offs between generative quality and efficiency, supporting future non-autoregressive language generation research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.
