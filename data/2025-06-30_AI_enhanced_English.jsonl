However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In\nclinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic\nhypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just\nlearned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final\ndiagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is\nassessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician\nvisits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator\n(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,\nproposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,\ncost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to\nphysicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum\naccuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO\ngeneralize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and\nLlama families.
