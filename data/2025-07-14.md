Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TableReasoner, an LLM-powered framework for table question answering, addressing challenges like large table size and entity ambiguity. It achieves top performance in SemEval-2025 Task 8.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TQA tasks struggle with real-world tabular data issues like large size, incomplete semantics, and entity ambiguity, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Proposes TableReasoner, a framework combining schema modeling, multi-step schema linking, and iterative reasoning to process tables efficiently.

Result: Achieves first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: TableReasoner effectively addresses TQA challenges through schema modeling and iterative reasoning, proving its superiority in benchmarks.

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [3] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic Stackelberg game framework models LLM jailbreaking interactions, introducing the 'Purple Agent' for proactive defense using RRT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing concern of jailbreaking in LLMs, where adversaries bypass safety mechanisms.

Method: Uses a sequential extensive-form game framework with the defender as the leader. The 'Purple Agent' employs RRT for adversarial exploration and proactive intervention.

Result: Provides a principled method to analyze adversarial dynamics and mitigate jailbreaking risks.

Conclusion: The framework and Purple Agent offer a robust solution for defending against LLM jailbreaking.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

### [4] [Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208)
*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The LLM-Nash framework models strategic interaction using LLMs, where agents choose reasoning prompts, capturing bounded rationality and diverging from classical Nash equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study strategic interactions in LLM-enabled systems by explicitly modeling bounded rationality and reasoning processes.

Method: Agents select reasoning prompts for LLM-guided decision-making, with equilibrium defined over the prompt space.

Result: Demonstrates divergence from classical Nash outcomes, highlighting cognitive constraints and mindset expressiveness.

Conclusion: Provides a new foundation for analyzing strategic interactions in systems using LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

### [5] [From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)
*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how agents balance curiosity (seeking knowledge) and competence (controlling the environment) in exploration. It compares model-based agents (Tabular and Dreamer) to analyze this trade-off, revealing distinct patterns and interactions between exploration and representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how intelligent agents balance curiosity and competence during exploration, bridging cognitive theories with reinforcement learning.

Method: Comparison of two model-based agents: one with handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) and another learning an internal world model (Dreamer).

Result: Tabular agent shows distinct exploration patterns for curiosity and competence, while Dreamer reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and representation learning.

Conclusion: Adaptive exploration balances pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [6] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods for Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems, balancing expressiveness and scalability by generalizing Backward Chaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between exhaustive (combinatorially explosive) and heuristic-based (unjustified) grounding methods in NeSy systems.

Method: Introduces a family of grounding methods inspired by multi-hop symbolic reasoning, generalizing Backward Chaining to control expressiveness vs. scalability.

Result: Shows grounding criterion selection is as crucial as the NeSy method itself, with experimental validation.

Conclusion: Proposed grounding methods offer a flexible trade-off between logic expressiveness and computational scalability in NeSy systems.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [7] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel multimodal quantum federated learning (QFL) method with a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism is introduced, improving accuracy by 6.84% (IID) and 7.25% (non-IID) over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QFL frameworks are limited to unimodal systems, failing to address real-world multimodal tasks. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes a multimodal QFL approach using quantum entanglement for intermediate fusion and introduces MMA to handle missing modalities during training.

Result: Simulations show accuracy improvements of 6.84% (IID) and 7.25% (non-IID) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The multimodal QFL with MMA effectively addresses the limitations of unimodal systems and enhances performance in distributed quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the potential dangers of integrating AI with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, which could introduce new vectors of harm.

Method: The paper examines the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts that enable harm, then details these new vectors of harm.

Result: The analysis identifies specific risks and calls for technical research to prevent and mitigate these harms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a call for more research to make it safer for AI agents to use cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as
well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position
paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this
argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each
of these new vectors of harm in detail. Finally, we conclude with a call for
more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and,
thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts.

### [9] [Abductive Computational Systems: Creative Abduction and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08264)
*Abhinav Sood,Kazjon Grace,Stephen Wan,Cecile Paris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews abductive reasoning in epistemology, science, and design, analyzes computational implementations, and identifies gaps in generating creative hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how abductive reasoning is discussed and implemented across domains, and to highlight its limitations in generating creative hypotheses.

Method: Review of theoretical accounts and analysis of computational systems using abductive reasoning.

Result: Theoretical frameworks lack models for creative hypotheses, and computational systems mostly use syllogistic forms.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on advancing creative abductive reasoning in computational systems.

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

### [10] [Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270)
*Zeyang Sha,Hanling Tian,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using LLM agents addresses threats from adversarial prompts and compromised tools via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous LLM agents with tool usage introduce new safety risks beyond conversational misuse, requiring protection against user-initiated and tool-initiated threats.

Method: The framework uses a tri-modal taxonomy (benign, malicious, sensitive) for prompts/tool responses, a policy-driven decision model, and a sandbox environment for fine-grained reward shaping.

Result: Evaluations on benchmarks (Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, BFCL) show improved threat resistance without compromising utility on benign tasks.

Conclusion: Safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, enabling trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

*Inclusion AI,:,Fudong Wang,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Kaixiang Ji,Lixiang Ru,Qingpei Guo,Ruobing Zheng,Tianqi Li,Yi Yuan,Yifan Mao,Yuting Xiao,Ziping Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B, a new MLLM, addresses dynamic spatial interaction gaps with innovative data and training methods, achieving SOTA in 8 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack dynamic spatial interaction capabilities, limiting real-world applications.

Method: Introduced a novel data pipeline (294.2K samples) and dynamic multi-task training with step-wise optimization and task-specific rewards.

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B achieved SOTA performance across 8 benchmarks in general and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The model successfully bridges the gap in spatial reasoning, enhancing MLLM capabilities for practical use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

### [12] [Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08392)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting to generate ethics requirements drafts, evaluated through case studies, showing effectiveness but needing human feedback for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethics requirements are often overlooked in elicitation due to time, resource constraints, and low priority, despite their importance for ethically aligned systems.

Method: Proposes a framework with an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting to critique and generate ethics requirements based on system descriptions.

Result: Captures most ethics requirements from interviews and adds new ones, but reliability issues highlight the need for human oversight.

Conclusion: The framework aids in integrating ethics into requirements engineering but requires human feedback to ensure reliability, promoting ethically aligned products.

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper defines contrastive explanation problems in propositional logic, analyzes their properties, computational complexities, and implements them using answer set programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and solve contrastive explanation problems ("Why P but not Q?") by comparing causes of P and Q.

Method: Defines canonical problems, analyzes properties in propositional logic, and implements solutions for CNF-formulas using answer set programming.

Result: Captures cardinality-minimal contrastive explanations and provides computational complexity analysis.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses contrastive explanations, with practical implementation demonstrating its utility.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations,
each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a
cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the
literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational
complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas
using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how
they work in practice.

### [14] [From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501)
*Keying Yang,Hao Wang,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bi-level framework maps natural language to logic via task abstraction and logic generation, outperforming baselines by up to 40% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between unstructured language and formal logic for systematic reasoning.

Method: Two-stage process: high-level task abstraction by LLM, followed by low-level logic generation for executable reasoning.

Result: 40% accuracy improvement over baselines, with enhanced transparency and error traceability.

Conclusion: The bi-level framework advances trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

*Mingda Zhang,Na Zhao,Jianglong Qin,Guoyu Ye,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining multi-granularity sparse activation and a hierarchical knowledge graph improves rare-disease diagnosis, achieving significant performance gains and nearing clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of insufficient knowledge representation, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning in rare-disease diagnosis.

Method: Uses multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts, a hierarchical knowledge graph, four matching algorithms, diversity control, and a fallback strategy.

Result: BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, accuracy gains of 0.12, and peak accuracy of 0.89. Expert evaluation confirms improved information quality and reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach enhances rare-disease diagnosis, potentially reducing the diagnostic odyssey for patients.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

### [16] [Large Multi-modal Model Cartographic Map Comprehension for Textual Locality Georeferencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08575)
*Kalana Wijegunarathna,Kristin Stock,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method using Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) to georeference biological samples by visually contextualizing spatial relations from locality descriptions, achieving ~1 km average error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions of biological samples lack georeferencing due to the labor-intensive nature of the task, and existing methods don't utilize maps effectively.

Method: Uses LMMs in a zero-shot grid-based approach to interpret spatial relations from descriptions and maps.

Result: Achieves ~1 km average distance error, outperforming uni-modal LLMs and existing tools.

Conclusion: Proposes integrating LMMs into georeferencing workflows, highlighting their potential for fine-grained map comprehension.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

### [17] [Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08603)
*Yonghua Hei,Yibo Yan,Shuliang Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion to improve speech instruction dataset construction, addressing gaps in LLM-generated data and TTS limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for speech instruction datasets rely on biased LLM-generated continuations or costly human annotation, lacking quality and scalability.

Method: A query rewriting framework uses multi-LLM knowledge fusion to adapt text instructions for TTS models, validated by multiple agents.

Result: The method improves data usability from 72% to 93% and excels in complex, context-related rewriting tasks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, high-quality alternative to human annotation for speech instruction datasets.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing LLM workflows in maintaining task continuity and generating executable models for complex engineering design tasks.

Method: Evaluated a structured MAS and a simpler 2AS using a solar-powered water filtration system as a case study. Introduced the Design-State Graph (DSG) for representation and tested with two LLMs under various configurations.

Result: MAS produced more granular DSGs but had low requirement coverage (less than 20%) and averaged below 50% code compatibility. 2AS achieved 100% code compatibility in specific settings but mode-collapsed.

Conclusion: Structured MAS improves design detail, but challenges remain in requirement coverage and code fidelity. Reasoning-distilled LLMs enhance workflow completion.

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

*Xingguang Ji,Yahui Liu,Qi Wang,Jingyuan Zhang,Yang Yue,Rui Shi,Chenxi Sun,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leanabell-Prover-V2 is a 7B LLM for formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, using verifier-integrated CoT and RL with verifier feedback for self-correction. It improves performance by 3.2% and 2.0% on MiniF2F.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance theorem-proving performance by integrating verifier feedback for self-aware reasoning and error correction.

Method: Posttrains strong prover models, upgrades RL with Lean 4 verifier feedback, uses feedback token masking, and optimizes reasoning trajectories.

Result: Performance gains of 3.2% and 2.0% on MiniF2F test set.

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2 effectively improves theorem-proving accuracy through verifier-integrated RL and self-correction.

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

### [20] [Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08664)
*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes INoT, a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework using Introspection of Thought, reducing token costs and improving performance by 7.95% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI Agents rely on LLMs/MLLMs but face limitations in natural language understanding and high inference costs from iterative reasoning.

Method: Introduces INoT, a framework with LLM-Read code in prompts, enabling programmatic dialogue reasoning within LLMs to reduce external token costs.

Result: INoT improves performance by 7.95% on average across six benchmarks and reduces token costs by 58.3% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: INoT is effective, versatile, and cost-efficient for AI Agent reasoning tasks, including image interpretation.

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

### [23] [An Enhanced Privacy-preserving Federated Few-shot Learning Framework for Respiratory Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08050)
*Ming Wang,Zhaoyang Duan,Dong Xue,Fangzhou Liu,Zhongheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving mechanisms is proposed to address limited labeled data and privacy concerns in respiratory disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The labor-intensive annotation of medical data and privacy concerns hinder respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: The study introduces a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm to prevent overfitting and integrates differential privacy noise to protect data. A weighted average algorithm aggregates local models.

Result: The method achieves strong results with differential privacy, effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases across diverse data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances privacy protection and diagnostic accuracy in respiratory disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

*Kenshin Abe,Yunzhuo Wang,Shuhei Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) to handle black-box combinatorial optimization, improving performance over the original TPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial optimization is important in fields like chemistry and biology but remains underexplored in TPE, a popular hyperparameter optimization method.

Method: The authors generalize the categorical kernel in TPE to include a distance structure and introduce modifications for large combinatorial search spaces, reducing time complexity.

Result: Experiments on synthetic problems show the proposed method finds better solutions with fewer evaluations than the original TPE.

Conclusion: The algorithm is implemented in Optuna, enhancing TPE's applicability to combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO bridges the gap between pointwise absolute rewards and offline learning by using quantile rewards, outperforming DPO, REBEL, and SimPO in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like DPO and REBEL are limited to preference pairs, while PPO and GRPO require online learning. QRPO aims to simplify learning from absolute rewards offline.

Method: QRPO uses quantile rewards to enable regression to the KL-regularized RL objective's closed-form solution, avoiding the need for relative signals.

Result: QRPO consistently outperforms DPO, REBEL, and SimPO in chat and coding evaluations (reward model scores, AlpacaEval 2, LeetCode) with 8B-scale models.

Conclusion: QRPO offers a simpler, offline-compatible method for learning from absolute rewards, reducing length bias and scaling with compute for quantile estimation.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

*Pouria Mahdavinia,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoFaSGD is a memory-efficient fine-tuning method for large models, using low-rank SVD momentum updates to reduce GPU memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory challenges of fine-tuning large models with stateful optimizers like AdamW, which require excessive GPU memory.

Method: Proposes Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which dynamically updates low-rank SVD representations of momentum for efficient subspace optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive memory reduction (similar to LoRA) and performance, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: MoFaSGD offers an effective balance between memory efficiency and performance for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

TL;DR: Proposes a PDE-aware optimizer for PINNs to address gradient misalignment, outperforming Adam and SOAP in stability and accuracy on stiff PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimizers like Adam struggle with balancing loss terms in stiff or ill-conditioned PDE systems, leading to inefficiencies in PINNs.

Method: Introduces a PDE-aware optimizer that adapts parameter updates based on variance of per-sample PDE residual gradients, avoiding high computational costs of second-order methods.

Result: Benchmarked on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn, and KdV equations, the optimizer achieves smoother convergence and lower errors, especially in sharp gradient regions.

Conclusion: The PDE-aware optimizer enhances PINNs training stability, though scaling to larger architectures and hardware accelerators needs further research.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Motivation: Improve PINNs' performance by addressing sensitivity to point sampling using quasi-random methods.

Method: Propose QRPINNs, using low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of random points.

Result: QRPINNs show better convergence and outperform PINNs and adaptive methods in high-dimensional PDEs.

Conclusion: QRPINNs are effective, and combining them with adaptive sampling further enhances performance.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial

network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs fail to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction, which is critical for reliable predictions in engineering systems.

Method: KKT-Hardnet enforces constraints by projecting onto the feasible region using KKT conditions and reformulating them with log-exponential transformation for differentiability.

Result: KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs, demonstrated on test problems and a chemical process simulation.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet enables reliable hybrid modeling by integrating domain knowledge into machine learning, ensuring strict adherence to governing laws.

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM is effective for urban risk prediction, with well-calibrated and superior performance.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce

encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3

yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in

Conclusion: Text-LENS successfully generalizes to unseen items, improving educational assessment tools.

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Motivation: To provide a privacy-preserving alternative to facial recognition for emotion detection, especially useful for populations like Alzheimer's patients and PTSD veterans.

Method: Comparison of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) methods, specifically a quantum kernel-based SVM model.

Result: Quantum-enhanced SVM outperforms classical methods, achieving F1 scores over 80% and up to 36% improvement in recall.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for unobtrusive, accurate emotion recognition in clinical and assisted living settings, particularly for individuals with communication challenges.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early

TL;DR: The paper advocates for causal learning to improve anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, addressing interpretability and adaptability issues in current deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven anomaly detection methods lack interpretability and robustness, especially in dynamic, spatially distributed systems.

Method: Proposes causal learning with three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning.

Result: Causal models offer early warnings and root cause attribution, overcoming black-box detector limitations.

Conclusion: The paper aims to inspire causality-driven approaches for scalable, adaptive, and explainable anomaly detection in interconnected infrastructures.

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Method: CTRLS formulates CoT as an MDP with latent state transitions, using distributional reinforcement learning for principled exploration.

Result: Improves reasoning accuracy, diversity, and exploration efficiency in benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: CTRLS provides a robust, theoretically grounded framework for enhancing CoT reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

### [35] [EvA: Evolutionary Attacks on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08212)
*Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh,Soroush H. Zargarbashi,Jimin Cao,Aleksandar Bojchevski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvA, an evolutionary-based attack method, outperforms gradient-based attacks by directly solving discrete optimization, achieving an 11% higher accuracy drop in GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based attacks are suboptimal and limited to differentiable objectives, leaving room for more effective discrete optimization approaches.

Method: EvA uses evolutionary algorithms to directly solve the discrete optimization problem, enabling attacks on non-differentiable objectives and black-box models.

Result: EvA achieves an average 11% additional accuracy drop compared to previous attacks and works with robustness certificates and conformal sets.

Conclusion: EvA demonstrates untapped potential in attack design by outperforming gradient-based methods and offering broader applicability.

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InsightBuild combines causal analysis with a fine-tuned LLM to explain energy anomalies in smart buildings, improving diagnosis and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facility managers lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage in smart buildings, hindering efficiency improvements.

Method: A two-stage framework: causal inference (Granger tests, structural discovery) followed by LLM-based natural language generation for explanations.

Result: Evaluated on real-world datasets, InsightBuild provides clear, actionable explanations for energy anomalies.

Conclusion: Integrating causal discovery with LLMs enhances explanation quality for energy inefficiencies in smart buildings.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning approach is proposed to predict prosocial behavior in mobility scenarios, overcoming data scarcity by leveraging multi-modal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prosocial behavior prediction in mobility scenarios is underexplored due to lack of large labeled datasets.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning with multi-modal data, pre-training on diverse tasks and fine-tuning with a smaller labeled dataset.

Result: Significantly enhances model performance, addressing data scarcity and improving prosocial behavior prediction.

Conclusion: Provides a benchmark for prosocial behavior prediction and insights for intelligent vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

TL;DR: Proposes an estimation-free generative method using deterministic gradient descent to transport a uniform distribution to arbitrary data distributions, avoiding function estimation and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function estimation in generative models is computationally and statistically challenging; the paper explores whether data generation can avoid this step.

Method: Uses deterministic gradient descent to update point locations, leveraging physics of interacting particles, without function estimation or neural networks.

Result: Demonstrates theoretically and experimentally that the method can transport distributions effectively without traditional estimation steps.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a novel, estimation-free approach to generative modeling, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoreSPECT enhances clustering by leveraging interactions between density and geometry, improving K-Means and GMM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked interaction between density and geometry in clustering algorithms.

Method: Uses a novel neighborhood graph-based multi-layer propagation to extend partial partitions.

Result: Improves K-Means ARI by 40% and GMM by 14% on 15 datasets.

Conclusion: CoreSPECT outperforms density and manifold-based methods, with theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum-UnIMP integrates quantum circuits into LLM-based imputation, outperforming classical methods by leveraging quantum features for better data recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data degrades ML model performance; classical LLM-based imputation lacks ability to capture complex correlations in mixed-type data.

Method: Replaces classical embeddings with quantum feature maps from IQP circuits, utilizing superposition and entanglement for richer data representations.

Result: Reduces imputation error by 15.2% (RMSE) for numerical features and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% (F1-Score) for categorical features.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced representations show significant potential for complex data imputation, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training method combining extended Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' mathematical reasoning, achieving top performance in benchmarks like AIMO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning by integrating SFT and RL, as current methods lack a systematic approach for combining these paradigms effectively.

Method: Proposes a training recipe with prolonged SFT followed by RL (GRPO) to maximize accuracy and token efficiency.

Result: Extended SFT (10 epochs) boosts accuracy, while GRPO optimizes solution length, achieving top-tier benchmark performance.

Conclusion: The method provides a reproducible blueprint for developing highly accurate and efficient mathematical reasoners, with open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will
open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and
training configurations at

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse

traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Result: Small language models (SLMs) achieve or surpass larger models in content moderation, offering scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, efficient solution for AI content moderation, leveraging smaller models effectively.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks struggle with diverse, high-dimensional cloud workloads, especially during sudden demand changes, due to limited optimization.

Method: CA-QNN combines quantum computing with structural and parametric learning, converting workload data into qubits and using a novel architecture optimization algorithm.

Result: CA-QNN reduces prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27% compared to deep learning and QNN-based methods.

Conclusion: CA-QNN offers superior accuracy for cloud workload prediction, addressing inefficiencies in traditional models.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of current single-cell embedded topic models, such as qualitative interpretability evaluation and neglect of external biological knowledge, which hinder comprehensive analysis.

Method: The authors propose scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided model, and introduce a new interpretability benchmark with 10 quantitative metrics.

Result: scE2TM outperforms 7 state-of-the-art methods in clustering performance and shows superior interpretability in diversity and biological consistency.

Conclusion: scE2TM enhances scRNA-seq data analysis by providing high-quality embeddings and interpretable results, aiding in uncovering biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Result: The approach shows adequate performance in reconstruction accuracy, particularly in capturing parallel structures.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising solution to accelerate BPMN model creation, addressing gaps in existing datasets and methods.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely

still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting lane changes improves safety and efficiency in automated driving, but existing methods lack focus on maneuver prediction over time intervals and architecture comparisons.

Method: Implemented LSTM, CNN, and Transformer networks using the highD dataset, detailing data preparation, feature selection, and network design.

Result: Transformers outperformed LSTMs and CNNs, with accuracy ranging from 82.79% to 96.73%, showing robustness against overfitting.

Conclusion: Transformer networks are superior for lane change prediction, offering high accuracy and reliability across different input configurations.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Conclusion: QML's broader utility depends on developing quantum-native algorithms, better error correction, and realistic benchmarks to bridge theory and practice.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic

Result: Experiments show the method significantly reduces Type-I errors compared to classic two-sample tests and proves useful in interpretable and hierarchical clustering.

Conclusion: The two-cluster test is distinct and effective for cluster analysis, offering improved accuracy and practical applications in clustering tasks.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

TL;DR: OPT improves offline-to-online RL by introducing Online Pre-Training to address inaccurate value estimation, achieving 30% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline pre-trained agents often underperform during online fine-tuning due to distribution shift and inaccurate value estimation.

Method: Proposes OPT, which includes an Online Pre-Training phase to train a new value function for effective online fine-tuning.

Result: 30% average performance improvement across D4RL environments (MuJoCo, Antmaze, Adroit).

Conclusion: OPT effectively mitigates the issue of inaccurate value estimation in offline-to-online RL, enhancing fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

*Meihua Dang,Jiaqi Han,Minkai Xu,Kai Xu,Akash Srivastava,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel particle Gibbs sampling approach for inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in reward-guided text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models is under-explored, limiting their potential for high-quality text generation in reward-guided settings.

Method: Proposes particle Gibbs sampling with conditional Sequential Monte Carlo to iteratively refine diffusion trajectories, improving sample quality.

Result: Empirically outperforms prior methods in reward-guided text generation, achieving higher accuracy under fixed compute budgets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances key trade-offs in inference-time scaling, demonstrating significant improvements in text generation quality.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

*Anirudh Varanasi,Robin Degraeve,Philippe Roussel,Clement Merckling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RTNinja is an automated machine learning framework for analyzing random telegraph noise (RTN) signals without prior knowledge, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTN variability in nanoelectronics affects reliability and performance, but existing analysis methods are limited by assumptions and manual steps.

Method: RTNinja uses Bayesian inference (LevelsExtractor) and probabilistic clustering (SourcesMapper) to denoise, discretize, and infer hidden sources in RTN signals.

Result: Tested on 7000 datasets, RTNinja achieved high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate source characterization.

Conclusion: RTNinja is a robust, scalable tool for RTN analysis, aiding reliability benchmarking and device physics exploration.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

TL;DR: KGRAG-Ex enhances RAG systems by using knowledge graphs for structured, explainable retrieval and reasoning, improving factual grounding and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of explainability in RAG systems by leveraging structured knowledge graphs for transparent retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Uses a domain-specific KG built via prompt-based extraction, identifies relevant entities/paths, converts them into pseudo-paragraphs, and employs perturbation-based explanations.

Result: Experiments analyze sensitivity to perturbations, structural importance, semantic node types, and graph metrics' influence on explanations.

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex improves factual grounding and explainability in RAG systems through structured KG integration and perturbation-based explanations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

*Feijiang Li,Liuya Zhang,Jieting Wang,Tao Yan,Yuhua Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new generalization error bound for MLPs, advocating variance reduction of empirical loss. It proposes RSS-MLP, using Rank Set Sampling instead of Simple Random Sampling for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance MLP's generalization ability by reducing the variance of empirical loss, addressing the high randomness in traditional bagging methods.

Method: Proposes RSS-MLP, replacing Simple Random Sampling with Rank Set Sampling in bagging to reduce loss variance. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the approach.

Result: RSS-MLP shows smaller variance in empirical loss compared to SRS, with experimental results confirming its effectiveness on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RSS-MLP improves MLP performance by reducing empirical loss variance, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

TL;DR: Comparison of AdamW, Lion, and Sophia optimizers for LLM pre-training shows Sophia has the lowest loss, Lion is fastest, and AdamW performs best downstream.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most effective optimizer for reducing pre-training times and improving model performance in LLMs.

Method: Compared AdamW, Lion, and Sophia using two base architectures and single/multiple-epoch approaches, tuning hyperparameters with Maximal Update Parametrization and proxy models.

Result: Sophia had the lowest training/validation loss, Lion was fastest in GPU hours, and AdamW achieved the best downstream results.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice depends on priorities: Sophia for loss, Lion for speed, and AdamW for downstream performance.

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

### [58] [Evaluating SAE interpretability without explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08473)
*Gonçalo Paulo,Nora Belrose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to assess the interpretability of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders without relying on natural language explanations, enabling more direct evaluation and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating interpretability of SAEs and transcoders rely on generating explanations, which complicates the assessment process. The paper aims to simplify and standardize interpretability evaluation.

Method: The authors adapt existing methods to assess interpretability without needing natural language explanations, comparing their metrics with human evaluations.

Result: The proposed metrics provide a more direct and standardized way to evaluate interpretability, aligning with human judgments in various setups.

Conclusion: The work suggests improvements for evaluating interpretability in sparse coding techniques, advocating for more standardized and direct assessment methods.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

*Haitao Lin,Junjie Wang,Zhifeng Gao,Xiaohong Ji,Rong Zhu,Linfeng Zhang,Guolin Ke,Weinan E*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynBridge is a bidirectional flow-based generative model for multi-task reaction prediction, using a graph-to-graph transformer and discrete flow bridges to capture chemical transformations. It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical reactions involve discrete electron redistribution, requiring models to capture abrupt state transitions, such as bond changes. Existing methods lack bidirectional modeling of these transformations.

Method: SynBridge employs a graph-to-graph transformer and discrete flow bridges to model bidirectional chemical transformations between reactants and products, focusing on bonds and atoms' discrete states.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, and Pistachio datasets for forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Ablation studies highlight the benefits of structured diffusion in discrete spaces.

Conclusion: SynBridge effectively models bidirectional chemical reactions, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating the utility of discrete flow bridges for reaction prediction.

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Motivation: Address computational and energy inefficiency challenges in deploying VLMs on mobile devices for real-time applications.

Method: Evaluated llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm frameworks using LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B on a OnePlus 13R, measuring CPU, GPU, NPU usage, temperature, inference time, power, and user experience.

Result: CPU overuse during token generation, underutilized or unstable GPU/NPU, and degraded device responsiveness when GPU was used.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for optimized deployment frameworks to better utilize hardware accelerators and improve efficiency in mobile VLM applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFedKD is a novel Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) framework that uses discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and improve model performance in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFL suffers from catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous settings, where the model loses knowledge from previous clients. This paper aims to address this issue.

Method: Proposes SFedKD, which extends single-teacher knowledge distillation to a multi-teacher setting with fine-grained weighting based on class distributional discrepancies. It also includes a complementary-based teacher selection mechanism to avoid redundancy.

Result: SFedKD effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and outperforms existing FL methods in experiments.

Conclusion: SFedKD enhances SFL by addressing catastrophic forgetting through innovative knowledge distillation and teacher selection, proving its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for aligning RL agent behavior with complex objectives without modifying the reward function, using reward aggregation functions and an algebraic MDP perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning RL agent behavior with complex objectives is challenging due to reward function design. The work seeks an alternative approach.

Method: Introduces an algebraic MDP perspective, generalizing reward aggregation (e.g., discounted max, Sharpe ratio) beyond the standard discounted sum.

Result: The approach works in deterministic and stochastic settings, integrates with value-based/actor-critic algorithms, and optimizes diverse objectives.

Conclusion: The method is versatile and applicable to real-world RL problems, eliminating the need for reward function redesign.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CircFormerMoE, a deep learning framework using transformers and mixture-of-experts, predicts plant circRNAs directly from genomic DNA, addressing limitations of alignment-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circRNA identification methods rely on RNA-seq data, are computationally expensive, and inefficient for large-scale prediction, especially in plants with non-canonical splice sites.

Method: CircFormerMoE combines transformers and mixture-of-experts for two subtasks: splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing (SSP), validated on 10 plant species.

Result: The model accurately predicts circRNAs, including unannotated ones, and provides interpretability for sequence patterns.

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE offers a fast, accurate tool for large-scale plant circRNA discovery, aiding future functional genomics research.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles, posing risks in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses a spatial-temporal encoder and risk-attentive decoder to embed risk potential fields into trajectory predictions, with a risk-scaled loss function.

Result: Reduces prediction errors by 4.8% (NGSIM) and 31.2% (HighD), excelling in high-risk scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers interpretable, risk-aware predictions, enhancing safety and decision-making in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: AbbIE is a recursive Transformer variant improving perplexity and dynamic compute scaling, outperforming standard and iterative methods in zero-shot tasks and perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Transformer performance without relying on parameter or token count scaling, and to enable dynamic compute resource adjustment.

Method: Introduces Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a recursive Transformer variant performing iterations in latent space without specialized data or training.

Result: AbbIE achieves up to 12% better zero-shot learning and 5% lower perplexity, generalizing well with minimal training iterations.

Conclusion: AbbIE offers a new approach to scaling Transformer performance, demonstrating efficiency and adaptability in compute usage.

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments on five malware datasets show ADAPT consistently outperforms baseline models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADAPT enables more effective adaptation to concept drift in malware detection, reducing reliance on costly annotations.

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

*Ando Shah,Rajveer Singh,Akram Zaytar,Girmaw Abebe Tadesse,Caleb Robinson,Negar Tafti,Stephen A. Wood,Rahul Dodhia,Juan M. Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A remote sensing framework monitors sustainable rice irrigation practices (DSR and AWD) in Punjab, India, achieving 78% accuracy in classification and scalability across 3 million plots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rice cultivation's high water use (24-30% of global freshwater) and groundwater depletion in Punjab (41.6 cm/year) necessitate sustainable practices. Limited adoption data hinders policymaking.

Method: Partnered with PRANA to train 1,400 farmers, used Sentinel-1 imagery to classify water management practices, and validated with ground truth data.

Result: 78% F1-score in distinguishing DSR from traditional methods; scalable mapping showed strong correlation (Pearson=0.77) with government records.

Conclusion: The framework enables policymakers to track adoption, target interventions, and measure impacts of sustainable water management practices.

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

*Parag Dutta,Ambedkar Dukkipati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LoGIC, a multi-agent reinforcement learning game for unsupervised image captioning, achieving improved performance without additional labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing labeled datasets are exhausted for training Vision Language Models (VLMs), making unsupervised image captioning essential for further improvements.

Method: Uses two agents ('speaker' and 'listener') trained with GRPO algorithm, leveraging pre-trained VLMs and LLMs, and lightweight components for unsupervised training.

Result: Achieves 46 BLEU score with pre-trained VLMs (2 points higher than vanilla VLM) and 31 BLEU score with lightweight components (10 points higher than existing unsupervised methods).

Conclusion: LoGIC effectively improves unsupervised image captioning performance, demonstrating its potential for advancing AI systems without relying on additional labeled data.

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAKD addresses collaborative fairness in federated learning by tackling imbalanced covariate shift through asynchronous knowledge distillation, improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook imbalanced covariate shift, a key challenge in federated learning.

Method: FedAKD uses client and server updates: asynchronous knowledge distillation for clients and global model updates with high-confidence samples.

Result: FedAKD improves fairness, accuracy, and client participation on FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and EHR datasets.

Conclusion: FedAKD effectively balances prediction accuracy and collaborative fairness in heterogeneous federated learning settings.

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WERSA introduces a linear-time attention mechanism combining random spectral features and Haar wavelets, outperforming quadratic methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency of quadratic attention in transformers for long sequences.

Method: Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA) merges random spectral features, Haar wavelets, and learnable parameters for selective attention.

Result: WERSA achieves best accuracy, reduces training time by 81%, and cuts FLOPS by 73.4%, excelling on long sequences.

Conclusion: WERSA enables efficient, accurate long-context models, promoting sustainable and scalable AI development.

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

*Uri Stern,Eli Corn,Daphna Weinshall*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel score to measure local overfitting in deep neural networks, proposes a two-stage method to recover forgotten knowledge, and demonstrates its effectiveness across various datasets and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite theory predicting overfitting with increased model capacity, it rarely occurs globally. The paper investigates local overfitting and its link to the double descent phenomenon.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and (2) distilling it into a single model to retain forgotten knowledge without added inference cost.

Result: The method outperforms original models and independently trained ensembles, especially under label noise, reducing training and inference complexity.

Conclusion: Local overfitting is a significant issue, and the proposed method effectively addresses it, offering a win-win solution for performance and complexity.

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

TL;DR: A MAD-OPT framework integrates domain knowledge into AI analytics for thermal power plants, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low AI adoption in thermal power plants due to lack of domain knowledge in data-centric analytics.

Method: Developed a Mahalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT) framework with domain-informed constraints.

Result: MAD-OPT successfully optimized thermal efficiency and turbine heat rate, showing robustness and applicability beyond design limits.

Conclusion: Domain-informed constraints are crucial for effective AI solutions in thermal power systems, enhancing operational excellence and safe AI adoption.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

*Peter Crowley,Zachary Serlin,Tyler Paine,Makai Mann,Michael Benjamin,Calin Belta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLASH introduces a method for learning from suboptimal demonstrations in long-horizon and adversarial tasks, outperforming existing IRL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods assume optimal demonstrations or fail in long-horizon/adversarial tasks, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: SPLASH uses sample-efficient preference-based IRL and hierarchical demonstrations to handle suboptimality and complex tasks.

Result: SPLASH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reward learning, validated in simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: SPLASH advances IRL for practical robotic applications by addressing suboptimality and task complexity.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) combines policy gradient methods with mirror descent, using two regularizers for stability and robustness. Empirical analysis shows their interplay is crucial for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and empirical validation of PMD's regularization components in RL.

Method: Large-scale empirical analysis with over 500k training seeds on small RL environments, studying the interplay of distance and MDP regularizers.

Result: The two regularizers can partially substitute each other, but their precise combination is critical for robust performance.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of careful regularization tuning for robust RL algorithms, addressing hyperparameter sensitivity.

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes pairing test-time adaptation (TTA) with risk monitoring to detect model degradation, extending sequential testing tools for unlabeled test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shifted test data challenges model deployment; TTA helps but may degrade over time, requiring failure detection.

Method: Extends sequential testing with confidence sequences to monitor performance without labeled test data, adapting to model updates.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across datasets, shift types, and TTA methods.

Conclusion: Combining TTA with risk monitoring provides a rigorous solution for detecting model failure in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

*Idan Mashiach,Oren Glickman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes tracking parameters during the final training plateau to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, focusing on high-activity parameters for better adaptation to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks degrades performance on old tasks when learning new ones. Existing regularization techniques aim to constrain important parameters but may not account for the nonconvex optimization landscape.

Method: Track parameters during the final training plateau, identifying those with high activity (movement and variability) as they indicate flat directions in the loss landscape, suitable for adaptation.

Result: The approach effectively balances mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining strong performance on newly learned tasks.

Conclusion: Focusing on parameter activity during the final plateau offers a novel and effective strategy for addressing catastrophic forgetting in deep learning.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive NVAR model combining delay-embedded linear inputs with a learnable MLP outperforms standard NVAR in chaotic system forecasting, especially under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NVAR and RC methods have fixed nonlinearities and scalability issues, limiting their adaptability to noisy or high-dimensional data.

Method: Proposes an adaptive NVAR model with a shallow MLP for feature generation and joint training of MLP and linear readout via gradient-based optimization.

Result: The adaptive model showed better predictive accuracy and robustness under noisy conditions compared to standard NVAR.

Conclusion: The adaptive NVAR model improves forecasting performance and scalability by learning data-driven nonlinearities and simplifying parameter tuning.

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum-classical hybridization for scalable and accurate scientific machine learning, extending QFNOs to higher dimensions and distributed execution.

Method: Partitions Fourier operator computation between classical and quantum resources, uses unary encoding for quantum states, and optimizes parameters variationally. Implemented with PennyLane and PyTorch.

Result: PHQFNO matches classical FNO accuracy on Burgers' equation and outperforms classical methods on incompressible Navier-Stokes, with improved noise stability.

Conclusion: PHQFNO demonstrates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for solving complex PDEs efficiently and robustly.

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

TL;DR: BlockFFN introduces a novel MoE architecture with improved routing and sparsity to enhance efficiency and compatibility with acceleration techniques, achieving significant speedup on end-side devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational burden and inflexibility of vanilla MoE architectures, which hinder performance and acceleration under low-resource conditions.

Method: Proposes BlockFFN with ReLU-activated RMSNorm routing, CLS-aware training objectives, and efficient acceleration kernels combining sparsity and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves over 80% token-level sparsity and 70% 8-token chunk-level sparsity, with kernels providing up to 3.67× speedup on end-side devices.

Conclusion: BlockFFN outperforms MoE baselines, offering a scalable and acceleration-friendly solution for efficient deployment.

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, especially those governed by PDEs, by leveraging Koopman embedding for latent state representation and conditional Gaussian dynamics.

Method: Uses Koopman embedding to create latent states with conditional linear dynamics, forming a conditional Gaussian system. Analytical formulae for DA are integrated into the learning process.

Result: Demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and provides efficient, accurate DA results on nonlinear PDEs like Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: CGKN unifies SciML and DA, offering a framework for broader applications like design optimization and optimal control.

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Method: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in generative reward models and proposes a data augmentation strategy to train a more robust model.

Result: The new model shows improved robustness across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods, and the introduced robust model addresses this gap.

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We

### [82] [ML-Based Automata Simplification for Symbolic Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08751)
*Tiffany Yu,Rye Stahle-Smith,Darssan Eswaramoorthi,Rasha Karakchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSlim is a machine learning-based framework for simplifying symbolic accelerators, reducing FPGA resource usage by up to 40% and pruning transitions by over 30% while maintaining correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic accelerators face scalability issues due to memory use and routing complexity, especially for large datasets.

Method: AutoSlim uses Random Forest classification to prune low-impact transitions in NFA graphs, leveraging edge scores and structural features.

Result: Achieves up to 40% reduction in FPGA LUTs and over 30% pruning in transitions, scaling to larger graphs than benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoSlim effectively mitigates resource blowup and demonstrates the impact of hardware interconnection on costs.

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

*Jeonghye Kim,Yongjae Shin,Whiyoung Jung,Sunghoon Hong,Deunsol Yoon,Youngchul Sung,Kanghoon Lee,Woohyung Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARS algorithm addresses Q-value extrapolation errors in offline reinforcement learning by combining reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and penalization of infeasible actions (PA), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline reinforcement learning suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors, especially when Q-functions are linearly extrapolated beyond the data range.

Method: Proposes RS-LN for gradual Q-value decrease outside data range and PA for penalizing infeasible actions, combined into the PARS algorithm.

Result: PARS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on the D4RL benchmark, excelling in tasks like AntMaze Ultra.

Conclusion: PARS effectively mitigates Q-value extrapolation errors, demonstrating superior performance in offline and online fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

### [84] [Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08784)
*Chuyan Chen,Yutong He,Pengrui Li,Weichen Jia,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreedyLore is a greedy low-rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning, combining error feedback and semi-lazy subspace updates to ensure convergence with a linear speedup rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication overhead in distributed optimization is a bottleneck; existing low-rank gradient compression methods either lack convergence guarantees (greedy) or perform poorly (randomized).

Method: GreedyLore uses error feedback to correct bias from greedy compression and semi-lazy subspace updates to maintain contractive compression, ensuring convergence.

Result: GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of O(σ/√NT + 1/T), the first linear speedup for low-rank gradient compression, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: GreedyLore bridges the gap between empirical performance and theoretical guarantees in low-rank gradient compression for distributed learning.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

### [85] [Optimistic Exploration for Risk-Averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08793)
*James McCarthy,Radu Marinescu,Elizabeth Daly,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORAC is an exploration-based method for Risk-averse Constrained RL that balances reward maximization and safety constraint satisfaction by adjusting cost weights dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Risk-averse RL often leads to overly conservative policies, limiting reward maximization and goal achievement. ORAC addresses this by encouraging exploration while maintaining safety.

Method: ORAC uses local confidence bounds for reward and cost functions, dynamically adjusting cost weights based on constraint violations to guide exploration.

Result: ORAC outperforms traditional methods in continuous control tasks like Safety-Gymnasium and CityLearn, avoiding sub-optimal policies and improving reward-cost trade-offs.

Conclusion: ORAC effectively balances exploration and safety in risk-averse RL, demonstrating superior performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

### [86] [The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802)
*Denis Sutter,Julian Minder,Thomas Hofmann,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques causal abstraction in interpretability, showing unrestricted alignment maps render it trivial. It highlights the need for assumptions about information encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the linearity constraint in causal abstraction and explore the implications of unrestricted alignment maps.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments with alignment maps on neural networks, including randomly initialized models.

Result: Unrestricted alignment maps make causal abstraction trivial, as any network can map to any algorithm, even without solving the task.

Conclusion: Causal abstraction alone is insufficient for interpretability; assumptions about information encoding are crucial for meaningful analysis.

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-aware framework improves vision-language models for precision agriculture by combining expert evaluation and self-consistency mechanisms, boosting accuracy in disease identification and treatment recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs underperform in agricultural domains, necessitating a specialized approach for reliable crop disease analysis.

Method: The framework uses prompt-based expert evaluation and a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism to enhance VLM outputs.

Result: Improvements include diagnostic accuracy (82.2% to 87.8%), symptom analysis (38.9% to 52.2%), and treatment recommendation (27.8% to 43.3%).

Conclusion: The compact, efficient system shows promise for real-time AI-driven precision agriculture in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate Text-to-Image models' adherence to prompts, revealing their limitations in generating simple binary images and following input distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of multimodal LLMs and Text-to-Image models lacks sufficient research on their reliability, prompting the need for a robust evaluation framework.

Method: A novel dataset and pipeline were created, using GPT-4o for ground-truth descriptions and evaluating models like Stable Diffusion and Janus variants.

Result: Models struggled with simple binary images and failed to match input dataset distributions.

Conclusion: Text-to-Image models need improvement in adhering to prompts and generating accurate outputs, highlighting gaps in current capabilities.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CNTLoRA, a data-driven weight initialization method for LoRA fine-tuning, improving convergence and performance by leveraging pre-training weights and fine-tuning activations without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with fixed ranks, limiting performance. The paper aims to enhance LoRA fine-tuning by addressing this limitation.

Method: CNTLoRA formulates LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem, using constraints to derive a closed-form weight estimate from pre-training weights and fine-tuning activations. It allows variable ranks for up and down matrices.

Result: CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven initialization methods in tasks like image generation, classification, and understanding, with faster convergence and better performance.

Conclusion: The proposed CNTLoRA framework provides an optimal solution for efficient LoRA fine-tuning, validated by extensive experiments and analyses.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image classification for UAVs by integrating ELM-based autoencoders and fuzzy logic for improved feature extraction and classification.

Method: HML-ELM uses a two-phase hierarchical framework: unsupervised feature extraction via stacked ELM-AEs and supervised classification with a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM).

Result: HML-ELM outperforms ML-ELM, ML-FELM, and ELM in benchmark and real-world UAV experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed HML-ELM is effective for active image classification, particularly in UAV applications, demonstrating higher efficiency than comparable methods.

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Conclusion: Lightweight AI models, especially CNNs, are promising for real-time hyperspectral processing and on-board satellite AI.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,

*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of denoising algorithms designed for Gaussian noise when applied to non-Gaussian noise types, such as uniform or Beta-distributed noise, without modifying the algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of denoising algorithms when the noise type deviates from the Gaussian assumption they were designed for.

Method: The study uses the original algorithm unchanged but replaces Gaussian noise with non-Gaussian noise (e.g., uniform, Beta, or mixed Gaussian) and evaluates performance. Experiments are conducted on a small laptop with minimal image sizes.

Result: The paper does not specify explicit results but highlights the challenge of adapting observations to different computational environments and noise types.

Conclusion: The study raises questions about the algorithm's adaptability to non-Gaussian noise and suggests further exploration in varied settings.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

TL;DR: A Deep Learning-based method for estimating building heights from single VHR SAR images, tested on a diverse multi-continental dataset, shows promising results, especially in Europe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building height estimation from VHR SAR imagery is vital for urban applications, requiring robust methods for diverse geographic contexts.

Method: Uses an object-based regression approach with bounding box detection and height estimation, trained and evaluated on a multi-continental dataset with cross-validation.

Result: Achieves a Mean Absolute Error of ~2.20m in European cities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, though variability increases in other continents like Asia.

Conclusion: Demonstrates DL's potential for cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building height estimation from single VHR SAR images.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

TL;DR: RegGS is a 3D Gaussian registration framework for reconstructing sparse, unposed views by aligning local Gaussians into a globally consistent representation using optimal transport and joint registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited priors, and feed-forward approaches face input format constraints. RegGS aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: RegGS uses an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport (MW₂ distance) and integrates photometric consistency and depth geometry in a joint registration module.

Result: Experiments on RE10K and ACID datasets show RegGS achieves high-fidelity Gaussian registration, precise pose estimation, and high-quality novel-view synthesis.

Conclusion: RegGS effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges, offering a robust solution for unposed image scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

### [97] [Temporally Consistent Amodal Completion for 3D Human-Object Interaction Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08137)
*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for dynamic human-object interaction reconstruction from monocular video, addressing occlusions and temporal inconsistencies using amodal completion and temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods fail under occlusions and dynamic conditions, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: Leverages amodal completion and integrates temporal context to refine reconstructions incrementally, without predefined templates.

Result: Validated with 3D Gaussian Splatting, showing superior precision in occlusion handling and temporal stability.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing techniques in dynamic scene reconstruction, especially in occluded scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing certifies vision model predictions against adversarial examples by leveraging guided denoising diffusion as adaptive GDP mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance robustness of vision models against adversarial attacks by adapting to inputs and providing provable certifications.

Method: Reinterpret guided denoising diffusion as adaptive GDP mechanisms, composed via a GDP privacy filter for end-to-end robustness analysis.

Result: Improves certified and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an ℓ₂ threat model.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines adaptive mechanisms and GDP privacy filters for robust vision model certification.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired people face daily challenges and injuries due to urban obstructions; a proactive alert system is needed.

Method: Utilizes transfer learning for depth estimation and object detection, optimized with quantization for lightweight deployment on embedded systems.

Result: Achieved a real-time model with mAP50 of 0.801, effectively detecting objects at close distances.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a practical solution to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals in urban environments.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HNOSeg-XS, a resolution-robust architecture for medical image segmentation using learnable partial differential equations via the Hartley transform, outperforming CNNs and transformers in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNNs and transformers face limitations in capturing long-range spatial correlations efficiently due to computational costs and input size constraints, leading to suboptimal results at higher resolutions.

Method: Proposes HNOSeg-XS, leveraging the Fourier neural operator with Hartley transform for resolution robustness, efficiency, and parameter efficiency.

Result: HNOSeg-XS achieved superior resolution robustness, fastest inference time (<0.24s), and highest memory efficiency (<1.8 GiB) with fewer than 34.7k parameters on BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets.

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS is a highly efficient and effective solution for medical image segmentation, addressing the limitations of CNNs and transformers.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of StarDist-3D in handling high-resolution instance segmentation and voxelization artifacts.

Method: Modifies StarDist-3D to decouple instance parameterization from voxel resolution, using smooth parametric surface patches (bicubic Bézier triangles).

Result: Outperforms StarDist-3D on blob-shaped instances, with more compact parameterizations and better resolution handling.

Conclusion: SurfDist effectively learns interpretable instance surface models while improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in fine-grained fungi species identification due to inter- and intra-species variations, addressed through the FungiCLEF 2025 competition.

Method: Used vision transformers, data augmentation, weighted sampling, and textual information. Explored generative AI for zero-shot classification but found it ineffective.

Result: Final model outperformed baselines, ranking 35/74, highlighting the value of domain-specific pretraining and balanced sampling.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in

intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), a smartphone-based tool for objectively measuring movement in clinical settings, validated across diverse populations and showing high reliability and clinical sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is a vital but underutilized health indicator due to lack of accessible measurement methods. PBL aims to bridge this gap by providing a scalable, objective tool for biomechanical assessment.

Method: PBL combines a cloud-enabled smartphone app for data collection and a novel algorithm for biomechanical modeling. It was validated using a large, diverse clinical dataset and tested in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics.

Result: PBL achieved joint angle errors within 3 degrees across varied populations. Gait metrics correlated with clinical outcomes (e.g., mJOA scores) and were more responsive to interventions than patient-reported measures.

Conclusion: PBL offers a clinically validated, low-burden method for capturing meaningful biomechanical data, enabling accessible monitoring of mobility impairments.

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

*Jiang Qin,Bin Zou,Haolin Li,Lamei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CR-Net improves cross-resolution SAR target detection by integrating structure priors and evidential learning, addressing domain adaptation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher SAR resolution causes scattering discrepancies, degrading target detection model generalization. Domain adaptation often fails due to blind feature adaptation.

Method: CR-Net uses Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) for structure-aware feature adaptation and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA) for semantic alignment.

Result: CR-Net achieves SOTA performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection by preserving intra-domain structures and enhancing discriminability.

Conclusion: CR-Net effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in SAR target detection, improving generalization and performance.

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2DAO-Talker introduces a unified framework for audio-driven talking head generation, improving motion modeling and rendering quality via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D methods for talking head generation suffer from rendering artifacts like motion blur and local penetration due to unstable motion field representation.

Method: The framework includes video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. It uses multi-granular motion decoupling for non-rigid and rigid motions, motion consistency constraints, and alternating optimization.

Result: M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2.43 dB PSNR improvement, 0.64 gain in video realness, and 150 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses rendering artifacts and enhances realism in talking head generation.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Craniofacial reconstruction is vital in forensic science for victim identification, leveraging computer vision advancements like deep learning.

Method: Uses Siamese networks trained on a custom dataset of 40 volunteers' skull X-rays and face images, minimizing Euclidean distance for similar pairs and maximizing for dissimilar ones.

Result: Satisfactory identification results were achieved on the cross-domain dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively identifies individuals from skull X-rays using Siamese networks, demonstrating potential for forensic applications.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging are often large and opaque, hindering clinical adoption. Interpretability techniques can address this by revealing model contributions.

Method: The proposed framework uses interpretability techniques (DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, Integrated Gradients) to guide pruning, retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer.

Result: Experiments show high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across medical image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables lightweight, interpretable models suitable for real-world healthcare deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo-Bot improves generative CBMs by eliminating auxiliary cues, enhancing interpretability and controllability through explicit concepts and diffusion-based energy functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous generative CBMs rely on auxiliary visual cues, which compromise interpretability and compositionality.

Method: CoCo-Bot uses explicit concepts and diffusion-based energy functions to transmit all information, supporting post-hoc interventions like concept composition and negation.

Result: Experiments show CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot offers a more interpretable and controllable generative model without auxiliary cues.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses poor generalization of multimodal prognosis models across cancers, proposing two modules (SDIR and CADE) to enhance weaker modality signals and improve cross-cancer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods for survival prediction focus on single cancer types and fail to generalize across cancers, a critical need in clinical practice.

Method: Introduces two modules: SDIR (sparsifies strong features to boost weaker modalities) and CADE (synthesizes target domain distribution by fusing morphological and gene expression data).

Result: Demonstrates superior generalization on a four-cancer-type benchmark, improving cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

Conclusion: The proposed modules (SDIR and CADE) effectively address generalization challenges, advancing robust cross-cancer survival prediction.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRAG is a multi-range adversarial stego generation framework that integrates convolution and transformer operators for deep hiding in JPEG images, ensuring imperceptibility and restorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hiding schemes are easily detected due to large payloads and limited feature extraction methods. MRAG aims to improve stealth and robustness.

Method: Combines local-range convolution and global-range transformer, uses multi-grained frequency decomposition, and employs angle-norm disentanglement loss for adversarial stego generation.

Result: MRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in maintaining secret restorability and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: MRAG effectively addresses detection vulnerabilities in deep hiding by leveraging multi-range representations and adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

### [113] [Cycle Context Verification for In-Context Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08357)
*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a framework to improve in-context learning (ICL) for medical image segmentation by self-verifying predictions and enhancing contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL's performance in medical image segmentation is sensitive to query-context alignment, and fine-tuning is impractical due to computational costs and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: CCV uses a cyclic pipeline to validate predictions by swapping query and context roles, updating prompts to improve alignment.

Result: CCV outperforms existing methods on seven datasets, enhancing ICL-based segmentation.

Conclusion: CCV is a robust solution for universal medical image segmentation, improving ICL performance without fine-tuning.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates ChatGPT-4o's ability to interpret traffic scenes for elderly driver assessments, showing improved performance with better prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore multimodal LLMs' potential in human-like traffic scene interpretation, focusing on elderly driver safety.

Method: Used zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, comparing model performance to human annotations via precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Prompt design significantly impacted performance, with recall for intersection visibility rising from 21.7% to 57.0%. Traffic density agreement improved from 53.5% to 67.6%. Stop-sign detection showed high precision (86.3%) but lower recall (76.7%).

Conclusion: Well-designed prompts make LLMs promising for driving risk assessments. Future work should test scalability with larger datasets and advanced models.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving video quality and aiding downstream computer vision tasks by focusing on unsupervised approaches.

Method: Review of common degradations, early conventional and deep learning methods, and categorization of unsupervised techniques like domain translation and self-supervision.

Result: Comprehensive overview of unsupervised methods, loss functions, and evaluation using synthetic datasets.

strengths and limitations. We then present an in-depth overview of unsupervised
methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain
translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based
methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in
unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired
synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key
challenges and outline promising directions for future research in this field.

### [116] [From Enhancement to Understanding: Build a Generalized Bridge for Low-light Vision via Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08380)
*Sen Wang,Shao Zeng,Tianjun Gu,Zhizhong Zhang,Ruixin Zhang,Shouhong Ding,Jingyun Zhang,Jun Wang,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEFU, a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and understanding, leveraging diffusion models and SCUF for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods treat low-light enhancement and understanding separately, limiting generalization and scalability.

Method: Uses pretrained generative diffusion models for zero-shot generalization and proposes SCUF with illumination-aware prompts and cycle-attention adapters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: GEFU successfully bridges low-light enhancement and understanding, improving both generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ODOR dataset for object detection in artworks, addressing biases in existing datasets and offering extensive fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for artwork object detection are biased and lack fine-grained categories, limiting robustness in real-world applications.

Method: The ODOR dataset provides 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, covering 139 fine-grained categories, with statistical analysis and baseline model evaluations.

Result: The dataset reveals challenging properties like dense, overlapping objects and spatial distribution, with baseline models highlighting its difficulty.

Conclusion: ODOR advances research in artwork object detection and cultural heritage studies, encouraging exploration of object recognition and smell perception.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

*Zhanxin Gao,Beier Zhu,Liang Yao,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a two-stage framework for text-to-image models that ensures subject consistency while maintaining pose and layout diversity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SCG methods often sacrifice layout and pose diversity for subject consistency, limiting expressive visual storytelling.

Method: CoDi uses a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) for pose-aware feature transfer and Identity Refinement (IR) for detail enhancement.

Result: CoDi achieves superior subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: CoDi effectively balances subject consistency with pose and layout diversity, enhancing visual storytelling capabilities.

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch is a versatile foundation model for correspondence matching, unifying tasks like stereo matching and optical flow under a 2D displacement framework without task-specific weights. It leverages robust feature extraction and large vision models for zero-shot capabilities, outperforming specialized models in cross-task evaluations and excelling in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to eliminate the need for task-specific architectures and fine-tuning in correspondence matching by proposing a unified 2D displacement framework, enabling generalization across diverse tasks and domains.

Method: PanMatch uses a 2D displacement estimation framework with shared model weights, a robust feature extractor, and a feature transformation pipeline leveraging large vision models. It is pretrained on a cross-domain dataset of 1.8 million samples.

Result: PanMatch outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything in cross-task evaluations and matches state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms. It also excels in zero-shot scenarios like rainy days and satellite imagery.

Conclusion: PanMatch demonstrates that a single model can handle diverse correspondence matching tasks effectively, achieving strong performance and generalization without task-specific adaptations.

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

### [120] [Deep Hashing with Semantic Hash Centers for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08404)
*Li Chen,Rui Liu,Yuxiang Zhou,Xudong Ma,Yong Chen,Dell Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHC introduces semantic hash centers to improve deep hashing for image retrieval by preserving semantic relationships between classes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point-wise hashing methods use data-independent hash centers, ignoring semantic relationships between classes, which can degrade retrieval performance.

Method: SHC uses a three-stage framework: (1) a classification network to identify semantic similarities, (2) an optimization algorithm to generate semantic hash centers, and (3) a deep hashing network to produce binary codes.

Result: SHC improves retrieval performance, with average gains of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71% in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively.

Conclusion: SHC effectively preserves semantic structure in hash codes, enhancing retrieval performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

*Shijun Yang,Xiang Zhang,Wanqing Zhao,Hangzai Luo,Sheng Zhong,Jinye Peng,Jianping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP introduces a novel prompt learning paradigm using MLLMs for adaptive prompt generation, enhancing cross-modal alignment and generalization in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in prompt learning: poor generalization on novel classes and limited cross-modal alignment in VLMs.

Method: Uses MLLMs for Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP), an AMG module for Visual Conditional Prompts (VCP), and a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 14 datasets.

Conclusion: MuGCP effectively improves multi-modal task performance through adaptive prompt generation and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can mentally complete occluded objects, but robotics struggle with this task. Current methods model scenes as undifferentiated wholes, failing to recognize complete objects from partial observations.

Method: Develops spatial contrastive learning for precise decomposition and in-situ generation to overcome incompleteness, leveraging observations and geometric cues for complete reconstruction.

Result: Achieves superior decomposition accuracy and produces geometrically faithful, visually intact objects in complex real-world and synthetic scenes.

Conclusion: InstaScene effectively bridges the gap in holistic 3D perception, enabling precise decomposition and complete reconstruction of occluded objects.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU accelerates diffusion transformers by mixed-resolution sampling and noise-timestep rescheduling, achieving up to 7x speed-up with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy computation in diffusion transformers hinders real-world deployment; existing methods focus on temporal acceleration, leaving spatial optimization unexplored.

Method: RALU uses three stages: low-resolution denoising, region-adaptive upsampling, and full-resolution refinement, with noise-timestep rescheduling for stability.

Result: Achieves up to 7x speed-up on FLUX and 3x on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation.

Conclusion: RALU is a training-free, complementary spatial acceleration method that preserves quality and integrates with existing temporal optimizations.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

*Ji Hyun Seo,Byounhyun Yoo,Gerard Jounghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene inpainting method uses a reference view to ensure realistic and consistent results by adjusting contributions of other views and warping the reference inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for object removal in radiance fields lead to inconsistent inpainted views due to perceptual blending issues.

Method: Leverages a reference view to estimate inpainting similarity, adjust contributions, and warp the reference inpainting to other views for guidance.

Result: Improves geometric fidelity and appearance consistency in inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses inconsistencies in 3D scene inpainting by utilizing a reference view.

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored area of building image tokenizers on pre-trained vision foundation models, enhancing their effectiveness for image tasks.

Method: Uses a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder, introduces region-adaptive quantization to reduce redundancy, and a semantic reconstruction objective for alignment.

Result: VFMTok achieves a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet, accelerates convergence by 3x, and enables high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without CFG.

Conclusion: VFMTok demonstrates significant improvements in image tasks, offering a promising direction for leveraging pre-trained models in tokenization.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

*Wei Zhang,Yihang Wu,Songhua Li,Wenjie Ma,Xin Ma,Qiang Li,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews deep learning-based 3D reconstruction, focusing on feed-forward models like DUSt3R, which jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry from unconstrained images in a single pass, contrasting them with traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., SfM, MVS) are computationally expensive and struggle in challenging scenarios. Deep learning offers a faster, more robust alternative.

Method: The paper analyzes feed-forward models, including their Transformer-based correspondence modeling and joint pose-geometry regression, comparing them to traditional and earlier learning-based methods.

Result: Feed-forward models like DUSt3R show promise in simplifying 3D reconstruction, though challenges like accuracy and scalability remain.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the potential of deep learning in 3D reconstruction but identifies key future challenges, including handling dynamic scenes and improving model scalability.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

*Benjamin Meyer,Lukas Tuggener,Sascha Hänzi,Daniel Schmid,Erdal Ayfer,Benjamin F. Grewe,Ahmed Abdulkadir,Thilo Stadelmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating document recognition as a transcription task, leveraging intrinsic document structures to improve accuracy, especially for complex or less common document types like engineering drawings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document recognition methods ignore intrinsic structural properties, relying on heuristics and limiting applicability to complex or rare document types.

Method: Introduces structure-specific inductive biases and a transformer architecture adapted to various document structures, validated on sheet music, shape drawings, and engineering drawings.

Result: Demonstrates successful end-to-end transcription of engineering drawings, a first, by incorporating inductive biases for graph structures.

Conclusion: The approach advances document recognition for less understood document types and guides future document foundation model design.

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

*Seyedeh Sahar Taheri Otaghsara,Reza Rahmanzadeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F3-Net is a foundation model for clinical medical image segmentation, addressing challenges like incomplete inputs and limited generalizability. It uses synthetic modality training and a zero-image strategy to handle missing MRI sequences, achieving robust performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues in clinical medical image segmentation, such as reliance on complete multimodal inputs and narrow task specificity, by creating a versatile and scalable solution.

Method: F3-Net employs flexible synthetic modality training and a zero-image strategy to substitute missing MRI sequences, avoiding explicit synthesis networks. Its unified architecture supports multi-pathology segmentation without retraining.

Conclusion: F3-Net is a robust, scalable solution for clinical medical image segmentation, bridging the gap between research and practical deployment.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2Dewarp, a dual-dimension document dewarping model that improves distortion perception by leveraging horizontal and vertical lines, along with a new dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dewarping methods focus only on horizontal lines, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to address this by incorporating vertical lines for better distortion perception.

Method: Proposes D2Dewarp, a model that uses horizontal and vertical line features, with a fusion module for feature interaction. Also introduces an automatic annotation method to create a large-scale training dataset.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks, with both quantitative and qualitative improvements.

Conclusion: D2Dewarp effectively addresses document dewarping by leveraging dual dimensions and a new dataset, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-people tracking by learning associations directly from detections without pre-computed tracklets and handling occlusions better.

Method: Builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph integrating spatial, contextual, and temporal data, with scene-specific encoding for occlusions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and a new dataset with 25 views and occlusions.

Conclusion: The model and dataset will be released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

Abstract: This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people
tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying
on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that
aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless
information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling,
the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new
large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene

state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with
flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be

### [131] [Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation for Occluded Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08520)
*Yufei Zheng,Wenjun Wang,Wenjun Gan,Jiawei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGFR introduces a teacher-student distillation framework to address occlusion challenges in person re-identification by purifying features and leveraging diverse occlusion patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen occlusion scenarios and feature contamination from holistic images.

Method: OGFR uses an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer and a Feature Erasing and Purification Module with reinforced knowledge distillation.

Result: The method effectively transfers purified holistic knowledge to occluded branches, improving robustness against occlusions.

Conclusion: OGFR successfully mitigates occlusion challenges and enhances feature representation in person re-identification.

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

### [132] [RadiomicsRetrieval: A Customizable Framework for Medical Image Retrieval Using Radiomics Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08546)
*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval is a 3D content-based medical image retrieval framework combining radiomics and deep learning for flexible, tumor-level queries with minimal user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods are limited to 2D images and require fully annotated queries, restricting clinical flexibility.

Method: Uses a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) for tumor embeddings, aligns them with radiomics features via contrastive learning, and enriches with anatomical positional embedding (APE).

Result: Enhances retrieval specificity with radiomics features and APE, supports flexible queries (shape, location, partial features), and requires minimal prompts.

Conclusion: The framework is adaptable for diverse clinical scenarios, aiding diagnosis, treatment planning, and research.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 2's memory bank is enhanced with reinforcement learning for better object tracking, outperforming hand-crafted rules by 3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SAM 2's handling of distractors, occlusions, and motion by optimizing memory updates with reinforcement learning.

Method: Frames memory control as a sequential decision-making problem, using reinforcement learning for updates.

Result: Achieves a 3x relative improvement over SAM 2 compared to existing heuristics.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is a powerful alternative to hand-crafted rules for memory control in tracking.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

*Cristina Mata,Michael S. Ryoo,Henrik Turbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA-KPN, a novel image translation method, ensures semantic matching for synthetic-to-real data translation, outperforming GAN-based methods in semantic segmentation with limited real labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain gap in semantic segmentation due to noisy pixel labels from synthetic data, ensuring semantic consistency in translations.

Method: DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise transformation parameters using a lightweight function and multi-scale discriminators for realism.

Result: Outperforms GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks and matches performance in face parsing.

Conclusion: DA-KPN provides a robust solution for semantic segmentation by guaranteeing semantic matching in translations.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC introduces a dual-stream paradigm for 3D Semantic Scene Completion, improving instance and scene category learning by replacing voxel queries with class queries and specialized decoding modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voxel-level approaches limit class-level information utilization, hindering granularity in completion results.

Method: Proposes DISC, using class queries and specialized decoding modules for targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively, and outperforms multi-frame methods using single-frame input.

Conclusion: DISC effectively enhances instance and scene category learning, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesTTA addresses gradual distribution shifts in vision-language models with a Bayesian framework for temporally consistent predictions and dynamic representation alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual test-time adaptation methods fail under temporally evolving distribution shifts, leading to catastrophic forgetting, unreliable confidence, and misaligned representations.

Method: BayesTTA uses class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions, adaptive covariance selection, and Gaussian discriminant analysis for calibrated predictions, followed by self-paced adaptation of normalization layers.

Result: BayesTTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four temporally evolving datasets and generalizes well on ten standard TTA datasets.

Conclusion: BayesTTA effectively handles gradual distribution shifts, improving robustness and efficiency in vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of transcribing handwritten documents by testing annotation methods that reduce training and annotation effort.

Method: Fine-tuning DAN on two datasets with different annotation strategies (normalized and diplomatic) using 201 birth certificate scans.

Result: Normalized annotation works better for standardized fields (dates, places), while diplomatic annotation excels for non-standardized fields (names, surnames).

Conclusion: The choice of annotation strategy should depend on the type of field being transcribed, balancing standardization and flexibility.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineBEV introduces a recurrent structure for temporal 3D perception, using MBFNet for feature alignment and achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods combining sequential BEV features face limitations due to dynamic changes caused by object motion, restricting performance gains.

Method: OnlineBEV uses a recurrent structure for temporal feature combination and MBFNet for motion-guided alignment, with Temporal Consistency Learning Loss for explicit alignment.

Result: OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on nuScenes, outperforming SOLOFusion and setting a new benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.

Conclusion: OnlineBEV effectively addresses temporal feature misalignment, demonstrating superior performance in 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multiagent system, DatasetAgent, automates high-quality image dataset construction from real-world images using MLLMs and image optimization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dataset construction is time-intensive; while AI-generated data lacks real-world value, DatasetAgent bridges this gap by automating real-world data collection.

Method: DatasetAgent coordinates four agents with MLLMs and image optimization tools to construct datasets based on user requirements.

Result: Experiments show DatasetAgent successfully expands existing datasets and creates new ones, training vision models for classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent offers an efficient, automated solution for high-quality real-world image dataset construction.

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI provides superior resolution but is costly and scarce; this work aims to make 7T-quality imaging accessible via lower-field scanners.

Method: The model was trained on paired 1.5T/3T and 7T T1 maps from MS patients, validated against ResViT and ResShift, and tested on a mixed dataset.

Result: 7T-Restormer achieved higher PSNR, SSIM, and lower NMSE than ResViT/ResShift, with 64% and 41% NMSE reductions, respectively, using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality 7T-like imaging from 1.5T/3T scans, enhancing clinical accessibility.

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ByDeWay is a training-free framework using Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP) to enhance MLLMs' spatial reasoning and grounding without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MLLMs' spatial reasoning and reduce hallucinations without requiring training or parameter changes.

Method: Segments scenes into layers (closest, mid-range, farthest) using monocular depth estimation, generates region-specific captions, and appends them to prompts for richer spatial context.

Result: Shows consistent improvements on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks across multiple MLLMs.

Conclusion: Depth-aware prompting (LDP) effectively enhances MLLMs' performance in zero-training settings.

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: MoSAiC is a unified CL framework for multi-modal satellite imagery, addressing challenges like high inter-class similarity and multi-label alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth System Observation (ESO) faces challenges like scene clutter and ambiguous boundaries, requiring robust representation learning.

Method: MoSAiC jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss.

Result: MoSAiC outperforms supervised and self-supervised baselines in accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization on BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS datasets.

Conclusion: MoSAiC is effective for multi-modal satellite imagery, enhancing semantic disentanglement and representation learning in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

TL;DR: A training-free MRI muscle segmentation method using keypoint tracking and optical flow achieves comparable accuracy to CNNs with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated MRI muscle segmentation faces challenges like high computational costs, reliance on large datasets, and limited accuracy for smaller muscles. CNN-based methods also suffer from overhead, poor generalizability, and interpretability.

Method: Proposes a training-free approach combining keypoint selection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow for segmentation.

Result: Achieves a mean DSC of 0.6-0.7, comparable to CNNs, with reduced computational demands and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, robust, and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction by simulating OS GUIs.

Method: Combines an RNN for state tracking with a diffusion-based neural renderer, trained on Ubuntu XFCE recordings of random and AI-generated interactions.

Result: Successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, captures mouse interactions, and predicts state transitions like app launches, though keyboard interactions are less precise.

Conclusion: NeuralOS advances toward fully adaptive neural interfaces, despite challenges in fine-grained keyboard modeling.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-CLIPScore is a lightweight, efficient embedding-based metric for evaluating and training captioning models, derived from a compressed and distilled version of CLIP using weight multiplexing, matrix decomposition, and a novel Similarity Regulator loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and resource-friendly alternative to CLIP for evaluating caption quality and training captioning models.

Method: Compress CLIP using weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition, and distill it with a novel Similarity Regulator loss to enhance vision-language alignment.

Result: L-CLIP achieves comparable performance to CLIP with fewer resources and faster runtime. L-CLIPScore is effective for caption evaluation but requires mixing with n-gram metrics for training.

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore is a viable, efficient metric for caption evaluation, though hybrid use with n-gram metrics is necessary for successful training.

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

*Andreas Lolos,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou,Jose Dolz,Aris Moustakas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGPMIL introduces a probabilistic attention-based MIL framework using Sparse Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification in instance relevance, improving interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods lack uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores, which is critical for reliable predictions in digital pathology.

Method: SGPMIL uses Sparse Gaussian Processes to learn posterior distributions over attention scores, incorporating feature scaling for efficiency.

Result: SGPMIL maintains competitive bag-level performance while enhancing instance-level prediction quality and interpretability.

Conclusion: SGPMIL effectively addresses uncertainty in MIL, offering improved reliability and efficiency in digital pathology applications.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack realism, diversity, and resolution, hindering progress in multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) for smart city applications.

Method: Introduces RoundaboutHD, a dataset with 40 minutes of 4K footage from four non-overlapping cameras, featuring 512 annotated vehicles, temporal consistency, and challenges like occlusions.

Result: Baseline results for detection, tracking, and re-identification tasks are provided, alongside subsets for specific tasks and additional metadata.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD bridges the gap between research and real-world MCVT applications, offering a robust benchmark for future work.

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera

*Anna Rosenberg,John Kennedy,Zohar Keidar,Yehoshua Y. Zeevi,Guy Gilboa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ensembles of weak learners using spectral total-variation (STV) features to address lack of training data, outperforming deep learning and Radiomics in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of sufficient training data in computer vision by leveraging STV features, which are lowly correlated and effective for texture characterization.

Method: Uses ensembles of weak learners based on STV features, derived from nonlinear eigenfunctions of total-variation subgradient, to analyze CT and PET scans.

Result: STV learners achieve the highest AUC (0.87) compared to neural nets (0.75) and Radiomics (0.79), with fine STV scales in CT being particularly predictive.

Conclusion: STV-based ensembles are effective for medical imaging tasks, offering superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HieraRS, a hierarchical interpretation paradigm for LCLU classification, addressing challenges in multi-granularity predictions and cross-domain transfer with heterogeneous hierarchies. It includes BHCCM for hierarchical consistency and TransLU for cross-domain adaptation, alongside the MM-5B dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for LCLU classification lack multi-granularity hierarchical predictions and struggle with cross-domain tasks involving heterogeneous hierarchies, limiting flexibility and generalization.

Method: Proposes HieraRS with BHCCM for hierarchical predictions and TransLU for cross-domain transfer, featuring CDKS and CDSA. Introduces the MM-5B dataset for validation.

Result: HieraRS enables multi-granularity predictions and efficient cross-domain transfer, improving semantic consistency and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances LCLU model flexibility and generalization, supported by the MM-5B dataset, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT introduces a unified framework for dynamic roadway geometry sensing in Digital Twins, combining real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning to address scalability, privacy, and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Digital Twins in transportation rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Large-scale DTs also face privacy, communication, and computational efficiency issues.

Method: The framework includes GeoLane (lightweight lane detection), Meta-GeoLane (personalized detection), and FedMeta-GeoLane (federated learning for privacy-preserving adaptation). It integrates with CARLA and SUMO for real-time DT rendering.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane outperforms baselines, achieving lower geometric error, better generalization, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for dynamic roadway sensing in DTs, with potential for flexible infrastructure modeling.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly

TL;DR: Birkhoff is a data-free compression algorithm for SAMs, offering versatility, agility, faithfulness, and compactness. It introduces Hyper-Compression and HyperLinear for efficient compression and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of SAMs in diverse fields creates a need for efficient compression without performance loss.

Method: Birkhoff uses Hyper-Compression to reduce parameter dimensions and HyperLinear to fuse decompression with matrix multiplication.

Result: Achieves 5.17x compression on SAM2-B with <1% performance drop, completing compression in 60 seconds.

Conclusion: Birkhoff is a competitive, efficient solution for compressing SAMs without fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intraclass variability in handwritten digits and provide an interpretable classification framework.

Method: Uses a CNN for feature extraction, k-means clustering for prototypes, and a Hopfield network for energy-based classification.

Result: Achieves 99.2% test accuracy on MNIST, showcasing robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: Deep feature extraction and prototype coverage are key for high performance, with broader applications in pattern recognition.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart advances 3D generation by enabling part-aware modeling and fine-grained control, validated by superior performance in experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

*Zhengqing Wang,Yuefan Wu,Jiacheng Chen,Fuyang Zhang,Yasutaka Furukawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLiFTs, a neural rendering method using compressed light-field tokens for efficient scene representation and rendering, balancing data size, quality, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compute-efficient rendering with rich scene information while allowing flexibility in token count for representation and novel view synthesis.

Method: Uses a multi-view encoder, latent-space K-means for token reduction, and a condenser to compress tokens into CLiFTs. A compute-adaptive renderer synthesizes novel views.

Result: Achieves significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets.

Conclusion: CLiFTs provide an effective trade-off between data size, rendering quality, and speed, validated by experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

*Hangjie Yuan,Weihua Chen,Jun Cen,Hu Yu,Jingyun Liang,Shuning Chang,Zhihui Lin,Tao Feng,Pengwei Liu,Jiazheng Xing,Hao Luo,Jiasheng Tang,Fan Wang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumos-1 is an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal modifications, using 3D RoPE and MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal correlations, and AR-DF for balanced training. It achieves competitive performance with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing autoregressive video generators, such as divergence from LLM architectures, bulky text encoders, or high latency.

Method: Introduces Lumos-1 with 3D RoPE and MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal modeling, and AR-DF for balanced training. Uses memory-efficient techniques for pre-training.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to EMU3, COSMOS-Video2World, and OpenSoraPlan on benchmarks like GenEval and VBench.

Conclusion: Lumos-1 efficiently integrates LLM architecture for video generation, offering competitive performance with minimal modifications and resource usage.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.

### [158] [RepeaTTS: Towards Feature Discovery through Repeated Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08012)
*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel fine-tuning method improves controllability in prompt-based Text-To-Speech models by leveraging latent features from uncontrollable variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current prompt-based TTS models, where control is either too constrained or too flexible, leading to uncontrollable variations.

Method: Uses principal component analysis to identify latent features from synthesized samples and incorporates them as labels for secondary fine-tuning.

Result: The method improves controllability, yielding both continuous and discrete features, especially in models without emotional disclosure.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-tuning regime effectively enhances model controllability by exploiting latent features.

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose NLP models like BERT, GPT, and T5 struggle with biomedical terminology, necessitating a domain-specific solution.

Method: Develop MedicalBERT by pretraining BERT on a large biomedical dataset, optimizing it with domain-specific vocabulary, and fine-tuning for tasks like named entity recognition and question answering.

Result: MedicalBERT surpasses BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, and general-purpose BERT by 5.67% on average across evaluated tasks.

Conclusion: MedicalBERT demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in biomedical NLP, highlighting its potential for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores

### [160] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes jailbreak complexity in LLMs across 2M+ conversations, finding no significant difference from normal chats. Toxicity in attacks remains stable, while assistant responses improve. Results suggest limits on jailbreak sophistication and highlight risks of academic disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies in LLMs for AI safety.

Method: Mass-scale empirical analysis using complexity metrics (probabilistic, lexical, compression, cognitive load) across diverse platforms.

Result: Jailbreak attempts are not more complex than normal chats; toxicity in attacks is stable, while assistant responses improve. No power-law scaling in complexity.

Conclusion: LLM safety is bounded by human ingenuity, not an arms race. Academic disclosure of sophisticated attacks could disrupt equilibrium.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT excels in structured financial NLP tasks like sentiment analysis but struggles with reasoning and generation tasks, lagging behind GPT-4 and human benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess FinGPT's performance in financial NLP tasks and identify its strengths and limitations for real-world applications.

Method: Evaluation across six NLP tasks using finance-specific datasets, comparing results with GPT-4 and human benchmarks.

Result: Strong performance in classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) but weaker in reasoning/generation tasks (e.g., question answering).

Conclusion: FinGPT is effective for structured tasks but needs improvements for complex reasoning, serving as a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

*Pierre Beckmann,Matthieu Queloz*

TL;DR: The paper synthesizes findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI) to argue that LLMs develop internal structures functionally analogous to understanding, proposing a three-tiered framework for machine understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view that LLMs rely solely on superficial statistics and to introduce a theoretical framework for machine understanding.

Method: Proposes a three-tiered conception of machine understanding: conceptual, state-of-the-world, and principled understanding, based on internal structures in LLMs.

Result: LLMs exhibit forms of understanding through internal structures, though their cognitive architecture differs from humans.

Conclusion: The debate should shift from whether LLMs understand to how their unique cognitive mechanisms operate.

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

*Nikita Mounier,Parsa Idehpour*

TL;DR: R3 is a framework for iterative text generation that reviews, remasks, and refines text using a Process Reward Model (PRM) to improve output without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is enabling models to efficiently identify and correct their own errors in iterative text generation.

Method: R3 uses a PRM to review intermediate blocks, remasks low-scoring blocks, and refines targeted segments.

Result: The framework focuses on sub-optimal parts, improving final output.

Conclusion: R3 is a simple, effective solution for enhancing pre-trained masked text diffusion models.

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

TL;DR: The study examines if LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) show consistent or random behavior in resume screening compared to human experts, revealing significant differences in performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs in automated hiring systems compared to human judgment.

Method: Controlled datasets tested three LLMs and human experts across contexts (No Company, Firm1, Firm2, Reduced Context) with identical/randomized resumes, using ANOVA and paired t-tests.

Result: Significant differences between LLMs and humans (p < 0.01), with GPT adapting strongly to context, Gemini partially, and Claude minimally. LLMs showed adaptive weighting patterns distinct from humans.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit interpretable patterns but diverge from human judgment, impacting their use in automated hiring.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETTA is a framework that manipulates LLM embeddings to bypass safety mechanisms, achieving high attack success rates without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignments are vulnerable to embedding space poisoning, a threat not fully understood or addressed.

Method: ETTA uses linear transformations to identify and attenuate toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space.

Result: ETTA achieves 88.61% attack success rate, outperforming baselines by 11.34%, and works on safety-enhanced models.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical flaw in LLM safety alignment, calling for embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal in-context learning (ICL) in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), focusing on demonstration configuration and controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) for image captioning. It combines external (configuration strategies) and internal (attention analysis) investigations to understand LMM behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the preliminary state of multimodal ICL research and leverage the controllability of ICEs for analyzing LMM inference characteristics.

Method: External experiments on demonstration configuration (shot number, image retrieval, caption assignment) and internal analysis of LMM attention patterns, including attention-based metrics and auxiliary experiments for model acceleration.

Result: Key findings on how ICEs impact performance and typical LMM attention characteristics, with insights into pre-training data features.

Conclusion: The study provides dual perspectives (external and internal) for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs, with broader applicability for large model research.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the liberal orientation in commercial LLMs, attributing it to training corpora, RLHF, academic discourse, and safety fine-tuning, distinguishing bias from epistemic differences, and suggesting it reflects Rawls' veil-of-ignorance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the causes and implications of the consistent liberal-leaning responses in LLMs.

Method: Systematic analysis of seven LLMs using Moral Foundations Theory, political ideology scales, and a new index of political controversies.

Result: Most models prioritize liberal values (care and fairness) due to training, RLHF, academic discourse, and fine-tuning. Fine-tuning increases liberal lean.

Conclusion: The liberal tilt is an emergent property of training, not bias, and may reflect Rawls' veil-of-ignorance, offering a new lens for collective reasoning.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

TL;DR: AI-assisted recruitment improved hiring efficiency and candidate success rates compared to traditional methods, though it favored younger, less experienced applicants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of AI on recruitment efficiency and candidate selection, addressing the lack of empirical evidence.

Method: Random assignment of 37,000 applicants to either traditional or AI-assisted recruitment, with final human interviews blind to the selection method.

Result: AI-assisted pipeline had 20 pp. higher final interview pass rate and 5.9 pp. higher new job probability, but favored younger, less experienced candidates.

Conclusion: AI enhances recruitment efficiency but may introduce biases, highlighting the need for careful implementation and evaluation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study found a significant decline in medical disclaimers in generative AI outputs (LLMs and VLMs) from 2022 to 2025, highlighting the need for adaptive safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the presence of medical disclaimers in AI-generated outputs for clinical contexts, given their critical role in ensuring user safety.

Method: Analyzed 500 mammograms, 500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions for disclaimer phrases across model generations (2022-2025).

Result: Disclaimer presence dropped sharply: from 26.3% (2022) to 0.97% (2025) for LLMs, and from 19.6% (2023) to 1.05% (2025) for VLMs.

Conclusion: As AI models grow more authoritative, adaptive disclaimers tailored to clinical contexts are essential for safety.

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context

*Hong Jia,Shiya Fu,Vassilis Kostakos,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs perform nearly as well as LLMs in mental health tasks, with few-shot learning significantly boosting their performance, making them viable privacy-preserving alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if SLMs can match LLMs in mental health understanding tasks, given their privacy advantages for sensitive applications.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five SLMs and three LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot learning across six mental health tasks.

Result: SLMs achieve mean performance within 2% of LLMs in binary tasks, with few-shot learning improving SLMs by up to 14.6%. Both struggle similarly on nuanced multi-class tasks.

Conclusion: SLMs are effective privacy-preserving tools for mental health understanding, especially with few-shot learning, making them scalable for sensitive data.

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

### [171] [Integrating External Tools with Large Language Models to Improve Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08034)
*Nripesh Niketan,Hadj Batatia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework integrating external tools with LLMs improves query accuracy in educational settings, outperforming top models like GPT-4o and LLaMA-Large.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide poor responses without context. Integrating external tools can enhance accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

Method: Developed a framework to access external APIs for additional data and computational tools (e.g., calculators). Evaluated using MMLU datasets.

Result: Athena framework achieved 83% (math) and 88% (science) accuracy, surpassing GPT-4o, LLaMA-Large, and others.

Conclusion: The framework enables complex computing ecosystems for LLMs, improving their utility in diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

### [172] [Barriers in Integrating Medical Visual Question Answering into Radiology Workflows: A Scoping Review and Clinicians' Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08036)
*Deepali Mishra,Chaklam Silpasuwanchai,Ashutosh Modi,Madhumita Sushil,Sorayouth Chumnanvej*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reviews MedVQA's clinical utility, revealing gaps like non-diagnostic QA pairs, lack of EHR integration, and misaligned metrics, with clinician surveys highlighting needs for patient history, multi-view support, and interactive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MedVQA's practical integration into radiology workflows by identifying research gaps and clinician perspectives.

Method: A scoping review of 68 publications (2018-2024) and a survey of 50 clinicians using the Arksey and O'Malley framework.

Result: 60% of QA pairs lack clinical relevance; datasets/models miss key features like EHR integration. Clinicians (29.8% find MedVQA useful) prioritize patient history, multi-view support, and interactive systems.

Conclusion: MedVQA has potential but requires addressing multimodal analysis, patient context, and evaluation alignment for clinical use.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

### [173] [CRISP: Complex Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08037)
*Matan Vetzler,Koren Lazar,Guy Uziel,Eran Hirsch,Ateret Anaby-Tavor,Leshem Choshen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP introduces a dataset for high-level plans in reasoning tasks, showing fine-tuned small models outperform large models and CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CoT and few-shot prompting for LLMs lack sufficient reasoning capabilities for complex problems.

Method: CRISP uses a multi-domain dataset of validated high-level plans, fine-tuning small models for better plan generation.

Result: Fine-tuned small models generate higher-quality plans than large models and outperform CoT reasoning, with cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CRISP demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning for plan generation, improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

### [174] [AblationBench: Evaluating Automated Planning of Ablations in Empirical AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08038)
*Talor Abramovich,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark suite, AblationBench, is introduced to evaluate AI agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research, showing current LMs struggle with these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support or automate parts of the research process, particularly ablation experiments, using AI agents built on language models.

Method: Developed AblationBench with two tasks (AuthorAblation and ReviewerAblation) and LM-based judges for evaluation. Tested frontier LMs on these tasks.

Result: Best-performing LM system identified only 29% of original ablations on average. Chain-of-thought prompting outperformed agent-based approaches.

Conclusion: Current LMs face challenges in ablation planning tasks, but chain-of-thought prompting shows promise.

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

### [175] [Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08045)
*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul is a system for efficient KV cache restoration in multi-turn LLM conversations, dynamically selecting compression strategies to reduce overhead without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed compression for KV caches, ignoring conversation-specific attention dynamics, leading to inefficiency and accuracy issues.

Method: Krul dynamically selects compression strategies, uses a token-wise similarity estimator, and a bubble-free scheduler for restoration.

Result: Krul reduces time-to-first-token by 1.5x-2.68x and KV cache storage by 1.33x-2.35x without quality loss.

Conclusion: Krul improves efficiency and accuracy in multi-turn LLM conversations by addressing dynamic attention patterns.

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

*Sebastian Walter,Hannah Bast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot approach using large language models to generate SPARQL queries from natural language, achieving state-of-the-art results on Wikidata and competitive performance on other knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient SPARQL query generation from natural language without fine-tuning, leveraging large language models and strategic graph exploration.

Method: Uses a large language model to explore the knowledge graph by executing SPARQL queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals, without fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Wikidata and competitive performance on Freebase and other benchmarks, even in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for diverse knowledge graphs and benchmarks, with potential for further enhancements like feedback mechanisms and few-shot examples.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

*Reilly Raab,Mike Parker,Dan Nally,Sadie Montgomery,Anastasia Bernat,Sai Munikoti,Sameera Horawalavithana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for statically typed, LM-powered subroutines is proposed to responsibly leverage language models, ensuring transparency and auditability while minimizing risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about safety, explainability, and bias in LM adoption by enabling transparent, auditable use with human oversight.

Method: Develop a framework for LM-powered subroutines, recording all artifacts for audit, and implement it as a library. Evaluate in public comment processing under NEPA.

Result: The framework is applied to create "CommentNEPA," which processes public comments. Performance is evaluated against human-annotated ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The framework enables responsible LM use with transparency and auditability, demonstrated effectively in public comment processing.

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

### [178] [Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)
*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor is a query-agnostic KV cache compression method using leverage scores, reducing memory by 63% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory bottleneck of KV cache in LLMs by compressing it without query knowledge.

Method: Uses approximate leverage scores for token importance and context-calibrated compression to infer maximum compression ratios.

Result: Achieves same performance as competitors with half the tokens, reducing KV memory by 63% in Longbench.

Conclusion: Compactor is effective and generalizable across tasks and model families, reducing memory burden significantly.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

### [179] [Distilling Empathy from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08151)
*Henry J. Xie,Jinghan Zhang,Xinhao Zhang,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for distilling empathy from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller Language Models (SLMs) using a two-step fine-tuning process and targeted prompts, achieving a 90% win rate in empathetic response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empathy is crucial for human interactions, and ensuring its retention in SLMs after distillation from LLMs is vital for applications like smartphones where resources are limited.

Method: A two-step fine-tuning process leveraging empathetic dialogue datasets from LLMs, along with four unique sets of targeted empathy improvement prompts.

Result: SLMs fine-tuned with this approach outperform base SLMs with a 90% win rate in generating empathetic responses, and targeted prompts improve performance by 10% over basic prompting.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively distills empathy into SLMs, enhancing their performance in human-centric applications.

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative LLMs often produce untruthful responses, necessitating accurate truthfulness prediction, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: The library includes diverse truthfulness prediction methods, spanning computational costs, access levels, grounding requirements, and supervision types. It supports HuggingFace and LiteLLM for local and API-based models.

Result: Evaluated on TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio datasets, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM provides a comprehensive, extensible toolkit for truthfulness prediction, filling gaps in existing solutions.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

### [181] [Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218)
*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs exhibit out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) due to a constant steering vector added by LoRA fine-tuning, improving generalization across related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why fine-tuned LLMs show surprising out-of-distribution generalization (OOCR) and mechanistically explain this phenomenon.

Method: Investigate OOCR mechanistically, focusing on LoRA fine-tuning's role in adding a steering vector. Train steering vectors from scratch to validate findings.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning adds a constant steering vector, enabling OOCR. This holds even for tasks like model backdoors, where unconditional steering suffices.

Conclusion: The study explains how fine-tuning enables OOCR, highlighting the role of steering vectors, which is crucial for safe and reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs as proxy students in ITSs and test question piloting were evaluated using NAEP data and IRT. Findings show strong models outperform average students, while weaker ones align incidentally. Grade-enforcement prompts affect performance, but no model-prompt pair consistently matches average students across subjects and grades. Guidelines for proxy selection are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs accurately emulate real student behavior and characteristics in educational contexts, particularly in ITSs and test question piloting.

Method: Collected 489 NAEP items for math and reading in grades 4, 8, and 12. Applied IRT to compare 11 diverse LLMs with real student populations.

Result: Strong LLMs outperform average students; weaker models align incidentally. Grade-enforcement prompts alter performance, but no model-prompt pair consistently matches average students across subjects and grades.

Conclusion: LLMs vary in their ability to emulate real students, highlighting the need for better training and evaluation strategies. Guidelines for selecting viable proxies are provided.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

TL;DR: The study uses NLP and HAM-CNN to analyze gender differences in pain experiences, revealing linguistic and prevalence disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier research often ignored gender's role in pain experiences, prompting this study to address the gap.

Method: Employed NLP and HAM-CNN to classify and analyze posts by gender, focusing on linguistic patterns and pain conditions.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 0.86; found linguistic differences and higher prevalence of certain conditions in females.

Conclusion: Gender significantly influences pain experiences, with females showing more emotional focus and distinct condition prevalence.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Result: Matches or outperforms SOTA models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-0528, Qwen3-235B-A22B) with ~30% fewer tokens. Successfully deployed in Kwaipilot.

Conclusion: KAT is effective, scalable (with a 200B MoE in progress), and improves real-world workflows, showcasing the potential of the AutoThink paradigm.

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

### [185] [Improving MLLM's Document Image Machine Translation via Synchronously Self-reviewing Its OCR Proficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08309)
*Yupu Liang,Yaping Zhang,Zhiyang Zhang,Zhiyuan Chen,Yang Zhao,Lu Xiang,Chengqing Zong,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel fine-tuning paradigm, Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR), is introduced to enhance Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) without forgetting their existing OCR abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in OCR but struggle with DIMT due to cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Traditional fine-tuning causes forgetting of monolingual abilities like OCR.

Method: SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before translation, leveraging its OCR strength while learning translation, inspired by "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage."

Result: SSR mitigates catastrophic forgetting, improving MLLMs' performance on both OCR and DIMT tasks.

Conclusion: SSR is an effective paradigm for enhancing DIMT without compromising existing OCR capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

### [186] [CRMAgent: A Multi-Agent LLM System for E-Commerce CRM Message Template Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08325)
*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMAgent, a multi-agent LLM system, helps merchants craft persuasive e-commerce messages by learning from top-performing content, retrieving similar templates, and providing rule-based rewrites, outperforming original templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merchants lack expertise and tools to write persuasive CRM messages, hindering retention and conversion.

Method: CRMAgent uses group-based learning, retrieval-and-adaptation, and rule-based fallback to generate high-quality message templates.

Result: CRMAgent outperforms original templates in audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Conclusion: CRMAgent effectively addresses the challenge of crafting persuasive CRM messages, offering scalable and expert-level performance.

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

*Yuzheng Xu,Tosho Hirasawa,Seiya Kawano,Shota Kato,Tadashi Kozuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MK2, a prompt-centric pipeline, generates viable product ideas from patents without extra training data, outperforming in most tests but lagging in materials-chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the conversion of patents into commercially viable product ideas within three years using lightweight prompt engineering.

Method: Uses Gemini 2.5 for prompt drafting and iterative editing, GPT-4.1 for idea generation, and an Elo loop with Qwen3-8B for prompt selection.

Result: MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard, winning 25 of 36 tests, but underperformed in materials-chemistry.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can competitively generate patent-based ideas, though deeper domain grounding may be needed for specialized fields.

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

### [188] [Distillation versus Contrastive Learning: How to Train Your Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08336)
*Zhichao Xu,Zhiqi Huang,Shengyao Zhuang,Ashim Gupta,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for training text rerankers, finding distillation superior when using a larger teacher model, but contrastive learning is better without one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically compare the effectiveness of contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions.

Method: Training rerankers of varying sizes and architectures using both contrastive learning and knowledge distillation, with a strong contrastive model as the teacher.

Result: Knowledge distillation outperforms contrastive learning when using a larger teacher, but not with a same-capacity teacher, especially for out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Use knowledge distillation with a larger teacher if available; otherwise, contrastive learning is a reliable alternative.

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

*Peng Wang,Xuesi Hu,Jiageng Wu,Yuntao Zou,Qiancheng Zhang,Dagang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to enhance LLMs and RLLMs in financial tasks, finding that prompting and agent frameworks improve LLMs via Long CoT, while RLLMs' inherent Long CoT limits further gains. Multilingual alignment aids LLMs but not RLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate how to unlock the full potential of LLMs and RLLMs in financial question-answering tasks.

Method: Utilized five LLMs and three RLLMs to evaluate the impact of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment on financial tasks.

Result: Prompting and agent frameworks enhance LLMs via Long CoT; RLLMs' inherent Long CoT limits further improvement; multilingual alignment benefits LLMs but not RLLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing LLMs and RLLMs in financial question answering, highlighting limitations and opportunities for future work.

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

*Itai Mondshine,Tzuf Paz-Argaman,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates n-gram and neural-based metrics for generative tasks across languages, finding n-gram metrics less effective for fusional languages and advocating for neural-based alternatives like COMET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the suitability of automatic evaluation metrics (n-gram and neural-based) for generative tasks in diverse languages, given their unclear effectiveness beyond English.

Method: A large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families, analyzing correlation with human judgments and the impact of tokenization.

Result: N-gram metrics show lower correlation with human assessments in fusional languages, while neural-based metrics like COMET outperform others, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: N-gram metrics are limited for fusional languages; neural-based metrics, particularly those trained for evaluation, are more reliable and should be prioritized.

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-agent LLM dialogues enhance scientific ideation, finding that larger agent groups, deeper interactions, and diverse roles improve idea novelty and feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the design of multi-agent LLM interactions for generating novel and feasible scientific ideas.

Method: Comparative analysis of agent roles, numbers, and dialogue depth, including ideation-critique-revision loops.

Result: Larger agent cohorts, deeper interactions, and diverse personas enhance idea diversity, while critic diversity boosts feasibility.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for effective multi-agent LLM systems in scientific ideation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

*Benjamin Newman,Abhilasha Ravichander,Jaehun Jung,Rui Xin,Hamish Ivison,Yegor Kuznetsov,Pang Wei Koh,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning on model-generated data filtered by models' own judgments improves factuality more than using factual gold data, challenging conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing language model hallucination by exploring effective finetuning data strategies.

Method: Studied factuality of finetuning data and its impact on hallucinations, comparing gold data and model-generated data with filtering strategies.

Result: Model-generated data filtered by models' judgments outperforms gold data in reducing hallucinations across domains.

Conclusion: Models' internal beliefs can serve as a strong signal for improving factuality in language models.

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

TL;DR: ChainEdit improves logical consistency in LLM knowledge editing by combining knowledge graphs and LLM reasoning, achieving a 30% boost in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM knowledge editing methods fail to maintain logical consistency when updating associated facts.

Method: ChainEdit integrates knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM reasoning to dynamically edit logically connected knowledge clusters.

Result: Experiments show a 30% improvement in logical generalization while maintaining editing reliability and specificity.

Conclusion: ChainEdit sets a new state-of-the-art for ripple effect handling and logical consistency in knowledge editing.

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

TL;DR: LLM-based multi-agent system simulates decision conferences, focusing on agreement detection among agents. Evaluated on stance and stance polarity tasks, LLMs show promise in dynamic debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in simulating real-world decision conferences and improving group decision-making processes.

Method: Developed an LLM-based multi-agent system for simulating decision conferences, evaluating six LLMs on stance and stance polarity detection tasks.

Result: LLMs reliably detect agreement in nuanced debates, and an agreement-detection agent enhances debate efficiency and coherence.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems can effectively simulate group decision-making and support expert elicitation workshops across domains.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation models lack error attribution capabilities, necessitating an automated framework for systematic error analysis.

Method: Developed a Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories, created the AttriData dataset, and fine-tuned MisAttributionLLM for error attribution.

Result: Extensive experiments confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework and model provide a comprehensive solution for error attribution in LLMs, enhancing performance analysis and failure diagnosis.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to assist in legal VAT decision-making, testing fine-tuning and RAG methods. Results show potential for automation but highlight limitations like hallucination and context handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce tax professionals' workload by automating legal decision-making using LLMs, given clients' natural language case descriptions.

Method: Experiments with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on textbook and real-world VAT cases to assess LLM performance.

Result: LLMs can support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial analyses, though full automation isn't feasible yet due to legal sensitivity.

Conclusion: Properly configured LLMs show promise for VAT tasks but require structured background information to address current limitations.

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

*Bruno Alexandre Rosa,Hilário Oliveira,Luiz Rodrigues,Eduardo Araujo Oliveira,Rafael Ferreira Mello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach using item response theory to enhance machine learning models for scoring textual cohesion in essays, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically scoring cohesion in essays is challenging, and existing machine learning algorithms often overlook individual text characteristics.

Method: The study uses item response theory to adjust machine learning scores, analyzing 6,563 ENEM-style essays and 1,235 narrative essays, extracting 325 linguistic features.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: This research offers a promising method for improving automatic cohesion evaluation in educational essays.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

### [200] [A Third Paradigm for LLM Evaluation: Dialogue Game-Based Evaluation using clembench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08491)
*David Schlangen,Sherzod Hakimov,Jonathan Jordan,Philipp Sadler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces clembench, a tool for evaluating LLMs using dialogue game-based evaluation, combining control and ecological validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing LLM evaluation paradigms (reference-based and preference-based) by offering a controlled, repeatable, and goal-directed method.

Method: Develops clembench, a mature implementation for dialogue game-based evaluation, optimized for ease of use and extensibility.

Result: clembench enables benchmarking of models with provided game instances and supports custom test extensions.

Conclusion: clembench bridges the gap between controlled and ecologically valid LLM evaluation, facilitating broader adoption of dialogue game-based methods.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaPa is a vision-language model framework for multimodal procedural planning, integrating task-environment alignment and counterfactual reasoning to improve action sequence generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored areas of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning in LLMs for embodied AI systems.

Method: LLaPa uses VLMs to generate action sequences from text and images, enhanced by TER for task-environment alignment and CAR for counterfactual reasoning.

Result: Outperforms advanced models on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks, achieving higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness.

Conclusion: LLaPa effectively integrates multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning, advancing procedural planning in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

### [202] [Semantic-Augmented Latent Topic Modeling with LLM-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08498)
*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates integrating LLMs with LDA for topic modeling, focusing on initialization and post-correction phases. While LLM-guided initialization improves early LDA iterations, it doesn't aid convergence and performs worse than baselines. LLM post-correction, however, boosts coherence by 5.86%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LDA's performance by leveraging LLMs in initialization and post-correction, addressing LDA's dependency on initialization quality.

Method: Integrates LLMs into LDA's initialization (Gibbs sampling) and post-correction phases, comparing their impact.

Result: LLM initialization improves early iterations but harms convergence; post-correction increases coherence by 5.86%.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in post-correction but challenge the assumption of their superiority in all text mining tasks.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

TL;DR: A feature-centric framework for multilingual multi-label emotion detection, evaluating document representations, dimensionality reduction, and model training across 28 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing linguistic diversity and resource constraints in multilingual emotion detection.

Method: Proposes a dynamic framework adapting document representations and learning algorithms, evaluating TF-IDF, FastText, Sentence-BERT, PCA, and MLP.

Result: TF-IDF excels in low-resource languages; contextual embeddings show language-specific strengths. PCA improves efficiency without performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve document understanding by eliminating the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings and reducing reliance on large pre-training datasets.

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document
understanding that eliminates the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings.
We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative
polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being
pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used
IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results
demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for
reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for

*Marcin Pietroń,Rafał Olszowski,Jakub Gomułka,Filip Gampel,Andrzej Tomski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o, Llama, and DeepSeek in argument mining tasks, highlighting ChatGPT-4o's superiority and discussing common errors. It also evaluates reasoning-enhanced variants and identifies weaknesses in prompt algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on LLMs' performance in publicly available argument classification databases and evaluate their effectiveness in argument mining tasks.

Method: Testing various LLMs (GPT, Llama, DeepSeek) and reasoning-enhanced variants (e.g., Chain-of-Thoughts) on datasets like Args.me and UKP.

Result: ChatGPT-4o performs best in benchmarks, while Deepseek-R1 excels in reasoning-enhanced tasks. Common errors are identified across models.

Conclusion: The study provides the first broad analysis of LLMs in argument datasets, reveals prompt algorithm weaknesses, and suggests directions for improvement.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

*Cristina Aggazzotti,Matthew Wiesner,Elizabeth Allyn Smith,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speaker attribution from ASR transcripts is resilient to errors and may outperform human-transcribed data due to speaker-specific error patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of ASR transcription errors on speaker attribution, as prior work focused only on human-transcribed data.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of speaker attribution performance using ASR transcripts, comparing degradation due to errors and ASR system properties.

Result: Attribution is resilient to word-level errors; ASR transcripts perform as well or better than human transcripts, possibly due to speaker-specific error patterns.

Conclusion: ASR-produced transcripts are viable for speaker attribution, with errors potentially enhancing performance by revealing speaker identity.

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

*Jiyao Zhang,Chengli Zhong,Hui Xu,Qige Li,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KELPS, a neuro-symbolic framework, improves formalizing informal math into machine-verifiable theorems by translating natural language into Knowledge Equations and then into formal languages, achieving 88.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks in LLMs for formalizing informal math due to limited multilingual parallel corpora.

Method: Proposes KELPS, an iterative framework translating natural language into Knowledge Equations and then into formal languages (Lean, Coq, Isabelle).

Result: Achieves 88.9% syntactic accuracy on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models like Deepseek-V3 and Herald.

Conclusion: KELPS effectively synthesizes and filters informal data into formal languages, enhancing accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

*Songlin Zhai,Guilin Qi,Yuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs introduces dynamic knowledge fusion without parameter updates, addressing catastrophic forgetting and real-time adaptability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-enhanced LLM approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited generalization, and static integration, hindering real-time knowledge updates.

Method: Proposes a knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module with outward (knowledge fusion) and inward (knowledge filtering) pathways for dynamic, parameter-free integration.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show KGA achieves comparable knowledge fusion performance without parameter modification.

Conclusion: The KGA framework enables real-time, dynamic KG integration in LLMs, improving adaptability and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

TL;DR: MM-Coder integrates visual aids like UML diagrams with text to improve code generation, addressing limitations of text-only LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack support for visual aids in software development, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Developed MM-Coder, a multimodal model, using MMc-Instruct dataset and MMEval benchmark for evaluation.

Result: MM-Coder shows improved accuracy but faces challenges in visual information capture and complex programming tasks.

Conclusion: The work aims to enhance industrial programming by combining text and visual inputs in LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

TL;DR: Cache steering is a lightweight method to guide language models using one-shot interventions on the key-value cache, improving reasoning without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance small language models' reasoning capabilities without costly fine-tuning or prompt changes.

Method: Uses GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to create steering vectors for the key-value cache, inducing chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Improves reasoning structure and task performance on benchmarks, outperforming prior continuous intervention methods.

Conclusion: Cache steering is efficient, stable, and practical for controlled generation, offering significant advantages over existing techniques.

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.
