But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality.
