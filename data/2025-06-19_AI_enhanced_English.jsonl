This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains\ncritical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce\nSupervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that\ntreats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups\ntokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM\nusing a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard\ncross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging\ntoken groups and guides the model to better handle different group\ndistributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its\nefficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping\nstrategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform\nbaseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks.

Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and\nfloating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under\nfeeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage\nheuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of\nsites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.\n  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile\ncoverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income\nresidents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission\nheadroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for\nnational-scale roll-outs.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair\noutcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,\nthe data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased\nand noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects\nmodel performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.\nTo tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label\nCorrection (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while\npreserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines\nthree key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization\nthrough Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity\nincentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed\napproach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance\nand fairness metrics compared to the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces GFLC, a method to correct biased and noisy labels in ML datasets while ensuring fairness, improving both performance and fairness metrics.", "motivation": "Fairness in ML is crucial as AI impacts society, but biased training data undermines fairness.
