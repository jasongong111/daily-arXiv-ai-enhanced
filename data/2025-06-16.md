### [1] [A Survey of Task-Oriented Knowledge Graph Reasoning: Status, Applications, and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11012)
*Guanglin Niu,Bo Li,Yangguang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) tasks, categorizing them by reasoning tasks, applications, and challenges, while also exploring advanced techniques like LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic summary of KGR tasks, including downstream applications and challenging paradigms, and to highlight trends and future directions.

Method: Categorizes KGR approaches into reasoning tasks, downstream applications, and challenging tasks, and reviews advanced techniques like LLMs.

Result: A detailed classification of KGR tasks and insights into the impact of advanced techniques on KGR.

Conclusion: The survey emphasizes key trends and future directions, advocating for further research in KGR, especially with emerging technologies like LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

### [2] [OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11023)
*Tomas Bueno Momcilovic,Barbara Gallina,Ingmar Kessler,Dian Balta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoGSN is an ontology and middleware for managing Assurance Cases (ACs) in the GSN standard, addressing challenges in maintaining and updating ACs with automated knowledge representation and queryable graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing ACs is challenging due to the effort required to maintain embedded knowledge amid changes, often deterring developers or leading to poorly managed cases.

Method: OntoGSN formalizes the GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules, includes a helper ontology, parser, SPARQL query library, and prototypical interface.

Result: The ontology adheres to the GSN standard, is evaluated for FAIR principles, and supports dynamic AC management, demonstrated in an example involving adversarial robustness in large language models.

Conclusion: OntoGSN provides a robust solution for dynamic AC management, enhancing confidence in system properties like safety and robustness.

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as a Clinical Evaluation Judge with Fuzzy Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11221)
*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge, combining fuzzy logic and LLMs to automate and align clinical communication skills evaluation with physician preferences, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalable and nuanced automated evaluation of medical students' clinical communication skills, aligning with subjective physician judgments.

Method: Data collection from an LLM-powered system, annotation using fuzzy sets (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, Contextual Distraction), prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning of LLMs.

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80% accuracy, with major criteria exceeding 90%, providing interpretable and human-aligned assessments.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the viability of combining fuzzy logic and LLMs for human-aligned automated evaluation in medical education, enhancing assessment robustness.

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

### [4] [MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11331)
*Jihoon Yun,Chengzhang Li,Dhrubojyoti Roy,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUDAS is a UDA framework for multi-label sound classification in IoT, improving accuracy with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods are limited to single-label tasks and require high resources, making them unsuitable for multi-label IoT applications like urban sound classification.

Method: MUDAS selectively retrains classifiers using high-confidence data, employs adaptive thresholds for pseudo-labels, and uses diversity regularization for accuracy.

Result: MUDAS outperforms existing UDA methods on the SONYC-UST dataset, achieving efficient performance in resource-constrained IoT settings.

Conclusion: MUDAS addresses key UDA limitations for multi-label sound classification, offering a practical solution for IoT devices.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

### [5] [Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375)
*Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Qingyang Mao,Yucong Luo,Qi Liu,Yupeng Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Deguang Liu,Xin Li,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemTable is a large-scale benchmark for chemical tables, addressing multimodal and domain-specific complexities in chemistry. It evaluates table recognition and understanding tasks, revealing performance gaps in models compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook the multimodal and domain-specific complexity of chemical tables, limiting the ability of models to support scientific understanding in chemistry.

Method: Introduces ChemTable, a benchmark with expert-annotated cell polygons, logical layouts, and domain-specific labels. Evaluates multimodal models on table recognition and understanding tasks.

Result: Models perform reasonably on layout parsing but show limitations on QA tasks, with significant gaps between open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: ChemTable highlights challenges in chemistry-aware table understanding and serves as a rigorous benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

### [6] [Large Language Model-Powered Conversational Agent Delivering Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) for Family Caregivers: Enhancing Empathy and Therapeutic Alliance Using In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11376)
*Liying Wang,Ph. D.,Daffodil Carrington,M. S.,Daniil Filienko,M. S.,Caroline El Jazmi,M. S.,Serena Jinchen Xie,M. S.,Martine De Cock,Ph. D.,Sarah Iribarren,Ph. D.,Weichao Yuwen,Ph. D*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study tested LLM-powered conversational agents for mental health support in caregivers, finding improved empathy and therapeutic alliance with Few-Shot and RAG techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mental health challenges faced by family caregivers using AI-driven support.

Method: Within-subject experiment with 28 caregivers evaluating four LLM configurations integrating PST, MI, and BCA.

Result: Best models (Few-Shot + RAG) improved contextual understanding and personalized support, validated by qualitative and quantitative feedback.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for empathetic, tailored caregiver support, though balancing assessment and advice delivery needs refinement.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

### [7] [FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419)
*Bin Sun,Boao Zhang,Jiayi Lu,Xinjie Feng,Jiachen Shang,Rui Cao,Mengchao Zheng,Chuanye Wang,Shichun Yang,Yaoguang Cao,Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FocalAD is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework focusing on local interactions to improve planning reliability by enhancing motion representations of critical neighbors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook local agent interactions, which are crucial for planning, leading to obscured risks and unreliable planning.

Method: FocalAD uses two modules: ELAI for graph-based ego-centric interaction representation and FLA Loss to prioritize decision-critical agents.

Result: FocalAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing collision rates by 41.9% and 15.6% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focusing on local interactions significantly enhances autonomous driving planning reliability and performance.

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

### [8] [Resolve Highway Conflict in Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Controls with Local State Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11445)
*Xuan Duy Ta,Bang Giang Le,Thanh Ha Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Local State Attention module is proposed to improve autonomous vehicle coordination in mixed-traffic environments using MARL, enhancing merging efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with local conflicts and stochastic events in mixed-traffic settings, requiring better state representation.

Method: The paper introduces a Local State Attention module using self-attention to prioritize nearby agents' information, tested in a highway merging scenario.

Result: The approach shows significant improvements in merging efficiency, especially in high-density traffic, compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The Local State Attention module effectively resolves conflicts and generalizes better in stochastic traffic events.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

### [9] [Structure-Aware Automatic Channel Pruning by Searching with Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11469)
*Zifan Liu,Yuan Cao,Yanwei Yu,Heng Qi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel structure-aware automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework using GCNs for global channel importance, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on local heuristics, missing global structural dependencies, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Uses GCNs to model network topology, automate pruning, and dynamically adjust pruning rate combinations via search.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with ResNet and VGG16 models.

Conclusion: SACP offers efficient, automated pruning with superior performance and accuracy retention.

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

### [10] [Reviving DSP for Advanced Theorem Proving in the Era of Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11487)
*Chenrui Cao,Liangcheng Song,Zenan Li,Xinyi Le,Xian Zhang,Hui Xue,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSP+ improves the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework with fine-grained neuro-symbolic enhancements, achieving strong performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that careful coordination of existing reasoning models and provers can match RL-based training in automated theorem proving.

Method: Enhances each phase of the framework: draft (subgoal generation), sketch (autoformalization), and prove (symbolic search integration).

Result: Solves 80.7%, 32.8%, and 24 problems from miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, and identifies formalization errors.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of classical reasoning patterns over RL-based training, with open-sourced components.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

### [11] [RAG+: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Application-Aware Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11555)
*Yu Wang,Shiwan Zhao,Ming Fan,Zhihu Wang,Yubo Zhang,Xicheng Zhang,Zhengfan Wang,Heyuan Huang,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+ extends RAG by integrating application-aware reasoning, improving LLM performance by 3-5% on average and up to 7.5% in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG paradigms lack explicit application of retrieved knowledge, limiting task-specific reasoning.

Method: RAG+ introduces a dual corpus (knowledge + application examples) for joint retrieval, enabling structured reasoning.

Result: Experiments show RAG+ outperforms standard RAG, with average gains of 3-5% and peak gains of 7.5%.

Conclusion: RAG+ bridges retrieval and application, advancing interpretable and capable LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

### [12] [Collaborative LLM Inference via Planning for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11578)
*Byeongchan Lee,Jonghoon Lee,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for small and large LLMs to collaborate at test time, combining strengths of cost-efficiency and reasoning ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between costly large LLMs and less capable but free small LLMs by enabling collaboration.

Method: A planner model generates a high-level plan, guiding a reasoner model to solve tasks collaboratively in multi-round cascades.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to proprietary models while reducing reliance on paid inference.

Conclusion: Planning is effective for cost-aware, cross-model collaboration under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

### [13] [VLM@school -- Evaluation of AI image understanding on German middle school knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11604)
*René Peinl,Vincent Tischler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new German-language benchmark dataset evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on visual reasoning tasks tied to middle school curricula, revealing significant gaps in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real-world, subject-specific benchmarks for VLMs, especially in non-English contexts like German.

Method: The dataset includes 2,000+ open-ended questions based on 486 images from nine middle school domains. Thirteen VLMs were evaluated for accuracy and adversarial performance.

Result: Top models scored under 45% accuracy, with poor results in music, math, and adversarial questions. Discrepancies between benchmark and real-world performance were noted.

Conclusion: Middle school tasks are valuable for testing VLMs, highlighting the need for better multimodal understanding in non-English settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

### [14] [Mitigating Hallucination Through Theory-Consistent Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11712)
*Wenqi Liu,Xuemeng Song,Jiaxi Li,Yinwei Wei,Na Zheng,Jianhua Yin,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SymMPO improves MLLMs by using symmetric preference learning and direct supervision to reduce hallucination, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing hallucination in MLLMs lack rigorous optimization and indirect supervision, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: Proposes SymMPO, which uses symmetric preference learning with direct supervision and a preference margin consistency loss to regulate preference gaps.

Result: SymMPO outperforms existing methods across five benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucination in MLLMs.

Conclusion: SymMPO is a superior method for reducing hallucination in MLLMs, combining theoretical rigor with practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

### [15] [Relational GNNs Cannot Learn $C_2$ Features for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11721)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-GNNs, a GNN-based approach for learning value functions in planning domains, cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features despite theoretical motivation. Alternative GNN architectures may perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the expressive power of R-GNNs in learning value functions for planning domains, leveraging the connection between GNNs and $C_2$ logic.

Method: Analyzes R-GNNs' theoretical limitations in learning $C_2$-defined value functions and identifies alternative GNN architectures.

Result: R-GNNs fail to learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features, contrary to empirical expectations.

Conclusion: Alternative GNN architectures may be more suitable for learning $C_2$-defined value functions in planning domains.

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

*Yaroslav Kivva,Sina Akbari,Saber Salehkaleybar,Negar Kiyavash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect estimation with latent confounders using multi-environment data, proposing a moment-based algorithm and proving identifiability conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating causal effects when latent confounders are present, leveraging data from multiple environments where certain parameters vary.

Method: Proposes a moment-based algorithm for estimation, assuming only one parameter (noise distribution or causal relationship) varies across environments. Also develops a procedure to identify the varying parameter.

Result: Shows identifiability under specific conditions but loses it if multiple parameters vary. Validates methods with synthetic data experiments.

Conclusion: The approach is effective when only one parameter varies, providing a practical solution for causal inference with latent confounders.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

*Margot Geerts,Manon Reusens,Bart Baesens,Seppe vanden Broucke,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can democratize real estate insights by generating interpretable house price estimates using optimized In-Context Learning, though they struggle with overconfidence and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information asymmetry in the real estate market by leveraging LLMs for accessible and interpretable price estimates.

Method: Systematically evaluate LLMs on international housing datasets using zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs produce meaningful estimates leveraging hedonic variables, offering accessibility and interpretability, though traditional models excel in pure accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs improve transparency in real estate appraisal, with practical guidance for prompt optimization, despite limitations in spatial reasoning and overconfidence.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores how LLM type and agent gender affect political bias in debates, finding Neutral agents align with Democrats, Republicans shift toward Neutral, and gender influences attitudes. Echo chambers form among politically aligned agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM type and agent gender attributes influence political bias and interaction dynamics in debates, addressing gaps in prior research.

Method: A structured multi-agent debate framework with Neutral, Republican, and Democrat LLM agents, varying LLMs, genders, and debate formats to analyze bias and attitude shifts.

Result: Neutral agents align with Democrats; Republicans shift toward Neutral. Gender affects attitudes, and politically aligned agents form echo chambers, intensifying biases.

Conclusion: LLM type and agent gender significantly influence political bias in debates, with implications for understanding AI behavior in social simulations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how Transformers-based systems learn demographic biases in AI recruitment and proposes a privacy framework to mitigate gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs in high-stake settings raises ethical concerns like biases, accountability, and privacy, prompting the need for bias mitigation.

Method: A privacy-enhancing framework is introduced to reduce gender information in the learning pipeline, tested on two LLMs in AI recruitment.

Result: The framework effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing data biases.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates gender bias in LLMs, addressing ethical concerns in AI recruitment.

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

### [20] [Towards a Cascaded LLM Framework for Cost-effective Human-AI Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11887)
*Claudio Fanconi,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cascaded LLM decision framework balances correctness, cost, and abstention confidence by delegating tasks to base models, larger models, or humans, improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize human-AI decision-making by balancing prediction correctness, reasoning cost, and confidence in abstaining or involving humans.

Method: A two-stage cascaded framework: (1) deferral policy for base vs. large model use, (2) abstention policy for human intervention. Includes online learning from feedback.

Result: Outperforms single-model baselines in accuracy, reduces costs, and handles abstentions effectively in QA tasks (ARC, MedQA, MedMCQA).

Conclusion: The cascaded framework offers a principled, cost-effective approach to human-AI collaboration, improving decision quality over time.

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

*Wuzhenghong Wen,Su Pan,yuwei Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Schema-R1 improves schema linking in Text-to-SQL tasks using reinforcement learning, enhancing reasoning ability and achieving a 10% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for schema linking models lack reasoning ability due to rote-learning and lack of high-quality reasoning samples.

Method: Schema-R1 uses reinforcement learning with three steps: constructing high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning.

Result: The method improves reasoning ability and achieves a 10% increase in filter accuracy.

Conclusion: Schema-R1 effectively addresses the limitations of current schema linking models by enhancing reasoning through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

### [22] [Tracing LLM Reasoning Processes with Strategic Games: A Framework for Planning, Revision, and Resource-Constrained Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12012)
*Xiaopeng Yuan,Xingjian Zhang,Ke Xu,Yifan Xu,Lijun Yu,Jindong Wang,Yushun Dong,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps (planning, revision, resource-constrained decisions) using strategic games, introducing new metrics beyond win rates. Results show varied performance among models, with ChatGPT-o3-mini excelling and Qwen-Plus struggling due to resource mismanagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook intermediate reasoning steps in LLMs, which are crucial for understanding model behavior and improving reliability.

Method: Strategic games are used as an evaluation environment, with metrics like overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and over-budget ratio.

Result: ChatGPT-o3-mini performed best (74.7% win rate), while Qwen-Plus had poor results (25.6% win rate) due to excessive resource use. A negative correlation was found between overcorrection risk and success rate.

Conclusion: Assessing how LLMs arrive at decisions, not just outcomes, is valuable for understanding and improving their reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

TL;DR: The paper highlights the unreliability of benchmark evaluations for the Deepseek-R1-Distill series and similar models, advocating for stricter evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant fluctuations in benchmark results of models like Deepseek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B, which hinder reproducibility of claimed performance improvements.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models to analyze evaluation inconsistencies.

Result: Subtle evaluation condition differences cause large result variations, making performance claims unreliable.

Conclusion: A more rigorous evaluation paradigm is needed to ensure reliable and reproducible model performance assessments.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using eye-tracking and machine learning for early dyslexia detection, achieving 88.58% accuracy with a Random Forest Classifier and hierarchical clustering for severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dyslexia affects 10-20% of people, impairing learning; current diagnostic methods need innovation for accessibility and cost-effectiveness.

Method: Combined eye-tracking (analyzing fixation and saccades) with machine learning (Random Forest Classifier and hierarchical clustering) for detection and severity assessment.

Result: Achieved 88.58% accuracy in detecting dyslexia and identified varying severity levels through clustering.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking with machine learning offers a non-invasive, accurate, and accessible diagnostic tool for dyslexia, including borderline cases.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'essential data science' as an ecosystem addressing 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, ethics) across the data life cycle. It highlights the role of data agents and the risk of divergence between computational and foundational data science without usefulness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To present a unified view of data science as an ecosystem, addressing challenges from the data universe and emphasizing the need for usefulness metrics to prevent divergence between computational and foundational aspects.

Method: The paper defines essential data science, data agents, and discipline-induced data science, splitting essential data science into computational and foundational components. It proposes measuring the usefulness of data discoveries to mitigate divergence.

Result: The framework identifies risks of divergence between computational and foundational data science and suggests usefulness metrics as a solution.

Conclusion: Rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data discoveries are essential to unify computational and foundational data science and sustain the ecosystem.

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy and transmission cost issues in centralized foundation models by proposing personalized federated learning (PFL) methods for multi-modal tasks, tackling data and model heterogeneity with novel aggregation and knowledge-sharing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training of foundation models raises privacy concerns and incurs high transmission costs. Federated learning (FL) and personalized FL (PFL) offer distributed alternatives but often overlook real-world data and model heterogeneity.

Method: The authors propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method for data heterogeneity and a dimension-invariant module for model heterogeneity, evaluated on a multi-modal PFL benchmark with 40 tasks.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in personalization and generalization, validated empirically.

Conclusion: The study advances PFL by addressing real-world heterogeneity, offering practical solutions for multi-modal tasks while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fairness issues in digital identity systems by studying how synthetic faces and gender classifiers are influenced by appearance-based biases.

Method: Experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, analyzing text-to-image systems and gender classification models.

Result: T2I systems link attractiveness to unrelated positive traits, and gender classifiers perform worse on less-attractive, non-White women.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fairness concerns in digital identity systems due to algorithmic lookism.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital
identity systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with real consumption data drive the need for synthetic alternatives to identify households benefiting from dToU tariffs.

Method: Comparative evaluation of WGAN, CTGAN, Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, assessing utility, distribution fidelity, and privacy leakage.

Result: Diffusion Models achieve highest utility (88.2% macro-F1), CTGAN resists reconstruction attacks best.

Conclusion: Structured generative models like Diffusion Models and CTGAN are promising for privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Qwen 2.5 and GRPO to improve code generation for languages with limited training data, demonstrated with Prolog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating accurate code for less-resourced languages compared to popular ones like Python.

Method: Combines small-scale Qwen 2.5 with GRPO, integrating reasoning-driven feedback in reinforcement learning.

Result: Improved reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness in Prolog code generation.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for enhancing code generation in languages with scarce training resources.

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the use of mobility data and GCNs in disease outbreak prediction, finding that mortality/hospitalization data improves accuracy more than mobility data. Spatial maps from GCNs correlate with lockdown orders, suggesting their utility as mobility indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine learning algorithms and epidemiological applications, addressing the underperformance of benchmark methods with real-world data due to mobility integration challenges.

Method: A two-phase approach: pilot study to assess mobility data significance, then evaluation of GCNs on a transformer backbone.

Result: Mobility data and GCNs do not significantly improve forecasting, but mortality/hospitalization data does. GCN-derived spatial maps correlate with lockdown orders.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into mobility representation in disease prediction, aiding decision-makers in outbreak preparedness.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YingLong, a non-causal transformer model, achieves state-of-the-art time series forecasting by leveraging delayed chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-input ensemble, outperforming competitors by 14-44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting methods (direct/recursive) are limited; YingLong introduces a novel non-causal approach for better accuracy.

Method: Uses bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer with masked token recovery, multi-input ensemble for variance reduction.

Result: Outperforms competitors by 14-44% on benchmarks (ETT, Weather, GIFT-Eval), with 60% best performance in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: YingLong's non-causal design and scaling effect (longer outputs boost accuracy) make it a superior foundation model for time series forecasting.

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

Motivation: BP has limitations like symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment, and frozen activity during backward passes, making it biologically and hardware inefficient.

Method: FTP uses feedforward computations to estimate layerwise targets, avoiding symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverses, enabling modular and local learning.

Result: FTP achieves BP-competitive accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, excels in sequential tasks, and outperforms BP in low-precision and hardware-constrained settings.

Conclusion: FTP is a promising, efficient alternative for on-device learning and neuromorphic computing due to its forward-only nature and hardware compatibility.

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces zero-shot-s², a task-aligned prompting method for detecting AI-generated images using pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), improving performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of supervised detection methods for AI-generated images, which struggle with generalization across diverse generators.

Method: Uses pre-trained VLMs with task-aligned prompting (zero-shot-s²) to detect AI-generated images, focusing on style and synthesis artifacts.

Result: Zero-shot-s² boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% across diverse datasets and models, showing strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Task-aligned prompting enhances VLM capabilities for AI-generated image detection, offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

effectively, highlighting the benefits of data fusion. This approach encourages
researchers to focus on multi model diagnosis for constant speed data

*Minjae Kwon,Tyler Ingebrand,Ufuk Topcu,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning ensures safety by adapting to hidden parameters in real-time, reducing violations with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden parameters like robot mass or friction introduce safety risks during execution, necessitating adaptive safety measures.

Method: Uses constrained hidden-parameter Markov decision processes, function encoders for real-time inference, and conformal prediction for uncertainty.

Result: Satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees, reduces violations, and generalizes well out-of-distribution with low runtime cost.

Conclusion: The proposed shield effectively ensures safety and optimality in policies under hidden parameter variations.

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalVLBench, a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) on visual causal reasoning tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of LVLMs in tasks like recognition and VQA, their potential in visual causal reasoning remains underexplored. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: The authors propose CausalVLBench, a benchmark with three tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. They evaluate state-of-the-art LVLMs on these tasks.

Result: The evaluation reveals fundamental strengths and weaknesses of existing LVLMs in visual causal reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to highlight limitations of current LVLMs and inspire improvements in their visual causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

### [37] [Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11035)
*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable version of Tversky's similarity model for deep learning, replacing geometric similarity with feature-based similarity, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The geometric similarity model in deep learning lacks psychological plausibility, while Tversky's feature-based model aligns better with human perception but hasn't been used in deep learning due to implementation challenges.

Method: Developed a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity, creating neural network building blocks like the Tversky projection layer, which can model non-linear functions.

Result: Experiments showed significant improvements: 24.7% relative accuracy boost in image classification and 7.5% perplexity reduction in language modeling, with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The work provides a psychologically plausible and interpretable alternative to geometric similarity in deep learning, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

*Yang Qin,Chao Chen,Zhihang Fu,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Peng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Interactive Cross-modal Learning (ICL) framework to improve text-to-image person re-identification by refining text queries through human-centered interaction and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with challenging candidate images due to network architecture and data quality limitations.

Method: The framework includes a Test-time Human-centered Interaction (THI) module for multi-round interactions with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy to enhance query discriminability.

Result: The method achieves significant performance improvements on four TIReID benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICL effectively addresses limitations in TIReID by leveraging human interaction and data augmentation, leading to superior results.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRePO-LTV, a framework combining graph representation learning and Pareto-optimization to improve LTV prediction in sparse data scenarios with interdependent tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LTV prediction is crucial for advertisers but is hindered by sparse data (low purchase rates) and task interdependencies.

Method: Uses graph representation learning to tackle data scarcity and Pareto-optimization to manage task interdependencies.

Result: Proposes GRePO-LTV as a solution to enhance LTV prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: GRePO-LTV effectively addresses data scarcity and task correlation challenges in LTV prediction.

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MoTE, a framework for class-incremental learning (CIL) using pre-trained models, addressing issues like prompt overwriting and dimensional misalignment. It introduces task-aware expert filtering and joint inference, outperforming existing methods without needing exemplar sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIL with pre-trained models faces challenges like prompt overwriting and dimensional misalignment. Existing methods like MoE struggle with parameter overwriting in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes MoTE, leveraging task-specific experts and sparse activation. Introduces task-aware expert filtering and joint inference to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Result: MoTE outperforms existing methods without requiring exemplar sets. The framework scales linearly with adapter numbers and explores performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: MoTE effectively addresses CIL challenges, offering a scalable and efficient solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

TL;DR: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) improves text-to-image synthesis but causes color distortions at high guidance weights. The proposed Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) mitigates distortions while maintaining alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address color distortions in CFG under high guidance weights, which degrade image quality despite improved text-image alignment.

Method: Analyze norm amplification in latent space, propose ADG to constrain magnitude variations and optimize angular alignment.

Result: ADG outperforms existing methods, improving color fidelity and perceptual alignment while preserving text-image alignment.

Conclusion: ADG effectively balances text-image alignment and color fidelity, enhancing overall image synthesis quality.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with multi-reactant interactions in chemistry and materials science, necessitating a more expressive framework.

Method: ChemHGNN employs hyperedges for multi-reactant modeling, reaction center-aware negative sampling (RCNS), and hierarchical embeddings.

Result: ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines on the USPTO dataset, especially in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: HGNNs, like ChemHGNN, are superior to GNNs for reaction virtual screening, offering a chemically informed approach to accelerate discovery.

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Motivation: To avoid inefficient training of task-specific weights from scratch by leveraging pretrained weights for guidance.

Method: GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill patterns from pretrained weights and decomposes updates into shared and specific components.

Result: GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods on CV and NLP benchmarks like VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE.

Conclusion: GenFT offers a simple, effective approach for efficient model adaptation, advancing PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces null space optimization for LLM quantization, proposing Q2N to reduce quantization error by constraining weight perturbations within the null space of input activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for LLMs show diminishing returns, suggesting the need for new strategies to achieve higher compression without performance loss.

Method: Proposes Q2N, a plug-and-play null space projection module, with an efficient approximation method and a closed-form solution for practical inference.

Result: Experiments on LLMs like LLaMA3, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 validate Q2N's effectiveness and the null space optimization perspective.

Conclusion: This work pioneers null space insights for LLM quantization, aiming to inspire advanced methods for further error reduction.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Motivation: Existing synthetic tool-use data generation methods are non-interactive and non-compositional, limiting training quality.

Method: RandomWorld procedurally generates interactive tools and compositional tool-use data for SFT and RL training.

Result: Models trained on RandomWorld data achieve SoTA on NESTFUL benchmarks and scale with data volume.

Conclusion: RandomWorld enables further improvements in tool-use training through synthetic data.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confidence estimation is critical for LLMs, especially closed-source ones, but current augmentation discussions are limited.

Method: The study examines various data augmentation techniques and their impact on confidence estimation, focusing on diversity and semantic preservation.

Result: Data augmentation improves performance and reduces overconfidence, with greater diversity being more effective. Random combinations of augmentations are recommended.

Conclusion: Diverse data augmentation enhances confidence estimation, and random combinations offer a practical solution for broader applications.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models.
Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a

### [48] [Perception-Driven Bias Detection in Machine Learning via Crowdsourced Visual Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11047)
*Chirudeep Tupakula,Rittika Shamsuddin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A perception-driven framework for bias detection in machine learning using crowdsourced human judgment, validated by statistical tests and ML cross-evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional bias detection methods, which rely on sensitive labels or rigid fairness metrics, by leveraging human visual intuition.

Method: Develop a lightweight web platform to collect binary judgments on group similarity from stripped-down visualizations of numeric data, aggregating feedback to flag biased segments.

Result: Perceptual signals from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, indicating visual intuition as a scalable proxy for fairness auditing.

Conclusion: The approach provides a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to conventional fairness diagnostics, enabling human-aligned, crowdsourced bias detection.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

*Sangwon Shin,Mehmet C. Vuran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMuSeNet, a complex-valued neural network, improves spectrum sensing accuracy and training efficiency in low-SNR environments, outperforming real-valued networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of real-valued neural networks in capturing wireless signal properties like phase and amplitude, especially in low-SNR conditions.

Method: Uses complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with residual architecture, introduces complex-valued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and complex plane intersection over union (CIoU) metric.

Result: Achieves 98.98%-99.90% accuracy, improves by up to 9.2 percentage points over real-valued networks, and reduces training time by 92.2%.

Conclusion: Complex-valued architectures enhance weak signal detection and training efficiency for spectrum sensing in low-SNR environments.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

*Zhaoge Bi,Linghan Huang,Haolin Jin,Qingwen Zeng,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NSW-EPNews is a benchmark for electricity price forecasting combining time-series and LLMs, showing marginal gains from news features for traditional models and modest improvements with LLMs, though they suffer from hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore textual signals in electricity price forecasting, necessitating a multimodal benchmark to evaluate time-series and LLM performance.

Method: The dataset includes half-hourly prices, temperature, and news summaries. The task is 48-step-ahead forecasting using multimodal inputs (lagged prices, news, weather) for classical models and prompt-engineered contexts for LLMs.

Result: Traditional models see marginal benefits from news features. LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro show modest improvements but suffer from hallucinations (fabricated/malformed outputs).

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews highlights the gap between LLM capabilities and high-stakes forecasting needs, providing a testbed for grounded numerical reasoning in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' reasoning abilities on NP-hard combinatorial problems, which are underexplored.

Method: Introduces ACCORD with a novel dataset representation, dynamic feasibility constraints, and attention-based routing for problem-specific modules.

Result: ACCORD, built on an 8B-parameter Llama, outperforms standard methods and larger LLMs, enhancing solution feasibility.

Conclusion: ACCORD is the first large-scale, end-to-end framework for applying LLMs to a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

*Weichang Wu,Xiaolu Zhang,Jun Zhou,Yuchen Li,Wenwen Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bootstrapping Your Behavior (BYB), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that automates behavior vocabulary selection, improving model generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual behavior vocabulary selection in UBS pretraining is labor-intensive, biased, and limits model generalization.

Method: BYB predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing future behaviors, using a student-teacher encoder scheme.

Result: Experiments show 3.9% AUC improvement, 98.9% training throughput, and meaningful unsupervised patterns. Online deployment improved financial risk prediction by 2.7-7.1%.

Conclusion: BYB eliminates manual vocabulary selection, enhances performance, and reduces financial risk, proving its industrial viability.

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

TL;DR: An adaptive MLaaS framework for IoT addresses data and system variability, ensuring efficient, scalable compositions with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic and uncertain nature of IoT environments causes data distribution shifts and evolving system requirements, challenging MLaaS effectiveness.

Method: The framework includes service assessment, candidate selection, and an adaptive composition mechanism using contextual multi-armed bandit optimization.

Result: The approach maintains QoS while lowering computational costs, validated on a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively adapts MLaaS compositions to IoT dynamics, ensuring long-term efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in materials science, using physics-driven data augmentation and generative models trained on minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large datasets for structural and functional materials by enabling learning from very few examples.

Method: Physics-driven data augmentation with local generative models and diversity curation to create large-scale datasets.

Result: Developed PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials, solving challenges in 3D experimental microscopy.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles data scarcity in materials science, with models and datasets made openly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

TL;DR: A method to generate human-interpretable explanations for inverse problems by using natural language events from a differentiable simulator and a Language Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are critical in fields like healthcare and climate science, but their iterative optimization processes are often opaque to domain experts. The goal is to make these processes more interpretable.

Method: Instrument a differentiable simulator to emit natural language events during forward and backward passes, then use a Language Model to create explanations from these events.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with an illustrative optimization problem and a neural network training example.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully bridges the gap between cryptic optimization processes and human-interpretable explanations.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRCMP is a structure-aware LLM framework for combinatorial optimization, integrating GNNs and LLMs to improve solution quality and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for combinatorial optimization often ignore structural priors, leading to suboptimal results. STRCMP aims to leverage these priors for better performance.

Method: Combines GNNs to extract structural embeddings with LLMs to generate solver-specific codes, followed by evolutionary refinement for optimization.

Result: Outperforms five neural and LLM-based methods in solution optimality and computational efficiency across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: STRCMP effectively integrates structural priors into LLM-based CO solving, achieving superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAMIX is an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework for LLMs, outperforming baselines by optimizing bit allocation to minimize quantization error while meeting compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing delta-compression methods for LLMs either perform poorly at high compression ratios or rely on empirical bit allocation, lacking theoretical grounding.

Method: ADAMIX uses a mathematical derivation of quantization error to formulate an optimal mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as a 0/1 integer linear programming problem.

Result: ADAMIX outperforms Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% on AIME2024 and GQA tasks with 7B models, respectively.

Conclusion: ADAMIX provides a theoretically grounded and effective solution for delta-compression in LLMs, achieving superior performance at high compression ratios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

*Dongyoung Kim,Jinsung Yoon,Jinwoo Shin,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFP (Preference Feature Preservation) is a new framework to mitigate bias in LLMs by preserving human preference feature distributions during online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning frameworks oversimplify human preferences, leading to biased LLM responses. PFP aims to address this by leveraging rich preference signals.

Method: PFP extracts preference features from offline data, trains a classifier, and uses distribution-preserving optimization to map features for new inputs during online learning. It integrates these features into prompts for explicit preference handling.

Result: PFP reduces bias in preference features and outperforms previous methods on standard LLM alignment benchmarks.

Conclusion: PFP effectively preserves preference feature diversity, improving LLM alignment and reducing bias in online learning.

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing region-based embedding models for knowledge graph completion often ignore semantic hierarchies in entities, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: SectorE embeds entities as points and relations as annular sectors in polar coordinates, combining modulus and phase to model inference patterns and relation attributes.

Result: SectorE achieves competitive performance on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, excelling in semantic modeling.

Conclusion: SectorE effectively addresses the semantic hierarchy challenge in knowledge graph completion, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel batch-mode active learning policy reduces training data needs by 75% and improves accuracy for neutron diffractometry structure determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron diffractometry structure determination is computationally expensive, and machine learning models require large simulated datasets, which grow exponentially with structural parameters.

Method: Introduces a batch-mode active learning policy using uncertainty sampling to prioritize uncertain labeled examples, reducing training data needs. Also designs a stream-based training workflow.

Result: Achieves 75% less training data usage with improved accuracy and 20% shorter training time without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning policy and streaming workflow significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in neutron diffractometry.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-granularity states and dynamic environments, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism to guide segmentation, capturing coarse- and fine-grained patterns dynamically.

Result: PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation and up to 599.24% in transfer learning.

Conclusion: PromptTSS effectively addresses the challenges of multi-granularity and adaptability in time series segmentation.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify data-policy coverage in offline RL, revealing its exponential impact on estimation errors. It proposes a poisoning attack (CSDPC) targeting rare decision patterns, degrading performance significantly with minimal data manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL studies overlook security risks from insufficient data-policy coverage and rely on single-step analysis, inconsistent with multi-step decision-making.

Method: The authors introduce a sequence-level concentrability coefficient, propose the CSDPC poisoning attack, and convert state-action pairs into decision units to identify and poison rare patterns.

Result: Poisoning just 1% of the dataset degrades agent performance by 90%, demonstrating the vulnerability of offline RL to such attacks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for new perspectives on analyzing and securing offline RL against coverage-based threats.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

*Hellockston Gomes de Brito,Carla Wilza Souza de Paula Maitelli,Osvaldo Chiavone-Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses supervised machine learning (decision trees, k-NN, Naive Bayes) to detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges in oil and gas production, focusing on hydrate formation. Decision trees achieved 99.99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oil and gas extraction faces challenges like blockages and hydrate formation, impacting efficiency. This study aims to address these issues using machine learning.

Method: Employed decision trees, k-NN, and Naive Bayes on a cleaned dataset from Petrobras' GitHub. Used scikit-learn for classification.

Result: Decision trees showed the highest accuracy (99.99%) in classifying hydrate formation.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively optimizes production efficiency by mitigating flow assurance challenges.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PVC detection is challenging due to variability in ECG waveforms from factors like lead placement and demographics.

Method: Developed uPVC-Net using a custom architecture and multi-source, multi-lead training on 8.3M beats from Holter monitors and wearable ECG patches.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 97.8%-99.1% on held-out datasets, with 99.1% on wearable ECG data.

Conclusion: uPVC-Net generalizes well across diverse leads and populations, showing promise for clinical use.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential
for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

### [66] [A Causal Lens for Learning Long-term Fair Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11242)
*Jacob Lear,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for long-term fairness in reinforcement learning, decomposing fairness metrics into direct, delayed, and spurious effects, and introduces a method to balance fairness notions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems, beyond immediate bias in static contexts.

Method: A general framework in reinforcement learning measuring fairness by qualification gain differences, decomposed into causal components (direct, delayed, spurious).

Result: Identifies intrinsic connections between fairness components and benefit fairness, proposing a method to balance fairness notions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances fairness requirements in dynamic systems, advancing fairness-aware learning.

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

*Ozan Baris Mulayim,Pengrui Quan,Liying Han,Xiaomin Ouyang,Dezhi Hong,Mario Bergés,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs show limited generalizability in BEM tasks, performing marginally better than statistical models in some areas but struggling with covariates and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) to address scalability challenges in Building Energy Management (BEM) by evaluating their generalizability across tasks and contexts.

Method: Evaluated TSFMs across four dimensions: zero-shot univariate forecasting, forecasting with covariates, zero-shot representation learning, and robustness to metrics and operational conditions.

Result: TSFMs exhibit limited generalizability, with mixed performance compared to statistical models, especially in handling covariates and complex environments.

Conclusion: Targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly in handling covariates and temporal dynamics, are needed for scalable BEM solutions.

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

*Milad Hoseinpour,Vladimir Dvorkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A guided diffusion model is proposed to generate synthetic data, incorporating domain-specific constraints like Kirchhoff laws, achieving high-fidelity results in power systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, security, and legal barriers in domains like healthcare, finance, and energy by creating synthetic data with generative models.

Method: Use a guided diffusion model with gradient-based guidance to integrate domain constraints (e.g., Kirchhoff laws) into the generative process.

Result: Produces statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets, validated by numerical results.

Conclusion: The approach effectively synthesizes domain-compliant synthetic data, with potential applications beyond power systems.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [69] [Sampling Imbalanced Data with Multi-objective Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11315)
*Karen Medlin,Sven Leyffer,Krishnan Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOODS, a multi-objective optimization framework for handling imbalanced datasets, and a new metric to evaluate sampling methods, achieving improved F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced datasets in two-class classification often lead to poor minority class performance. Traditional methods like reweighting or resampling fail due to lack of diversity consideration.

Method: Proposes MOODS, a multi-objective bilevel optimization framework for synthetic oversampling and majority undersampling, and introduces the ε/δ non-overlapping diversification metric.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance with 1-15% F1 score improvement due to enhanced diversity.

Conclusion: MOODS and the new metric effectively address imbalanced classification by optimizing sampling methods and quantifying their impact.

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

*Vispi Karkaria,Doksoo Lee,Yi-Ping Chen,Yue Yu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASNO, an attention-based spatio-temporal neural operator, to address challenges in SciML by improving interpretability and adaptability to unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for models that can learn evolving physical processes and generalize under varying conditions, especially in real-world applications like additive manufacturing.

Method: ASNO combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions, inspired by BDF, to enhance interpretability and adaptability.

Result: ASNO outperforms existing models on SciML benchmarks, showing promise for engineering and physics discovery.

Conclusion: ASNO is a robust solution for interpretable and generalizable SciML, with potential applications in engineering and physics.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

*Jared Lawrence,Ari Kalinsky,Hannah Bradfield,Yair Carmon,Oliver Hinder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses stochastic convex optimization with unknown parameters, proposing two methods: a reliable model selection technique to avoid overfitting and a regularization-based approach for unknown distance to optimality. These methods achieve near-optimal sample complexity and adaptability, validated by experiments on few-shot learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of unknown problem parameters in stochastic convex optimization, which complicates tuning and performance.

Method: 1. A reliable model selection method to avoid overfitting validation sets and tune learning rates. 2. A regularization-based method for unknown distance to optimality, ensuring adaptability.

Result: The methods achieve near-optimal sample complexity and adaptability, validated by experiments on few-shot learning tasks like fine-tuning CLIP models and prompt engineering Gemini.

Conclusion: Combining the two methods enables simultaneous adaptation to multiple problem structures, demonstrating improved performance and avoiding overfitting.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

### [72] [Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation via Evidential Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11347)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evidential Alignment uses uncertainty quantification to identify and suppress spurious correlations in deep neural networks without needing group annotations, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations, degrading generalization. Existing methods require costly annotations or deterministic models, which may not capture all biases.

Method: Proposes Evidential Alignment, leveraging uncertainty quantification and second-order risk minimization to debias models without annotations.

Result: Empirical results show improved group robustness across architectures and data modalities.

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment provides a scalable, principled solution to spurious correlations without needing annotations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

*Yilan Chen,Zhichao Wang,Wei Huang,Andi Han,Taiji Suzuki,Arya Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalization bound for gradient flow using the loss path kernel (LPK), which captures the training trajectory and adapts to data and optimization dynamics, providing tighter guarantees than static kernels like NTK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical generalization properties of gradient-based optimization methods, which are empirically successful but not fully theoretically explained.

Method: The authors use stability analysis of gradient flow and uniform convergence via Rademacher complexity, leveraging the LPK to derive a data-dependent generalization bound.

Result: The bound aligns with classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel methods, highlights the role of training loss gradients, and shows neural networks' feature learning capability. Numerical experiments confirm the bound's correlation with the true generalization gap.

Conclusion: The LPK-based bound offers tighter and more informative generalization guarantees, bridging the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

### [74] [EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11368)
*Pintu Kumar,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) models for graph data, showing label noise depends on node relationships (edges) and degree. It compares three EDN variants, demonstrating their impact on GNNs and noise-robust algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing node label noise models (SLN, CCN) ignore graph topology. EDN addresses this by considering edge influence on label noise.

Method: Three EDN variants are explored, analyzing their dependence on node degree. Experiments use 5 GNN architectures and 8 noise-robust algorithms on graph datasets.

Result: Two EDN variants cause more performance degradation in GNNs and noise-robust algorithms than traditional models. Statistical testing confirms this.

Conclusion: Incorporating EDN is crucial for reliable evaluation of noise-robust algorithms in graph-based learning.

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

*Bernardo P. Schaeffer,Ricardo M. S. Rosa,Glauco Valle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of stochasticity in score-based diffusion models on generation quality, using KL divergence bounds and numerical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochasticity affects sampling in diffusion models and quantify error propagation under different stochasticity choices.

Method: Theoretical analysis using log-Sobolev inequalities for forward process marginals, complemented by numerical and analytical examples.

Result: Stochasticity acts as an error-correcting mechanism for exact scores but involves a trade-off for approximate scores, depending on error structure.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into stochasticity's role in diffusion models, balancing error correction and amplification, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

TL;DR: FIGNN is a new GNN architecture enhancing interpretability in deep learning surrogate models for unstructured grids, using feature-specific pooling and mask-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs obscure spatial influences of features in multivariate tasks; FIGNN aims to clarify these influences.

Method: FIGNN introduces feature-specific pooling and mask-based regularization to align interpretability with predictive error.

Result: FIGNN achieves competitive performance and reveals meaningful spatial patterns in SPEEDY and BFS benchmarks.

Conclusion: FIGNN is a robust framework for interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical systems.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT methods like LoRA can cause models to rely on spurious tokens for decision-making, enabling control via SSTI, with varying effects based on LoRA rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate catastrophic failures in PEFT, particularly how spurious tokens can dominate model decisions and enable SSTI attacks.

Method: Applied SSTI across three model families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, Meta LLaMA-3) and four datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, Bias in Bios)), testing reliance on spurious tokens.

Result: 1) Single SSTI token can control decisions. 2) Light SSTI reliance scales with LoRA rank. 3) Aggressive SSTI favors higher LoRA ranks for robustness.

Conclusion: PEFT's efficiency comes with risks of spurious token reliance, highlighting the need for robustness in fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

*Kai Yue,Richeng Jin,Chau-Wai Wong,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel threat model in federated learning (FL) introduces a maliciously curious client that manipulates gradients to infer peers' private data, bypassing existing defenses and even amplifying data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL protocols are vulnerable to privacy leakage, and traditional defenses fail against client-side attacks, highlighting the need for a new threat model.

Method: The paper defines the maliciously curious client threat model, provides theoretical analysis, and develops a reconstruction algorithm combining gradient inversion with malicious update strategies.

Result: The attack achieves significant reconstruction success, and standard defenses may unintentionally improve reconstructed data quality by 10-15%.

Conclusion: The study exposes a critical blind spot in FL defenses, urging reevaluation of current privacy and robustness mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Motivation: Existing research on RAG systems overlooks how poisoning attacks can amplify model biases, particularly in sensitive contexts like gender stereotypes.

Method: The BRRA framework includes adversarial document generation, subspace projection for retrieval manipulation, and cyclic feedback for bias amplification. Experiments validate its impact.

Result: BRRA attacks significantly enhance biases in large language models, demonstrating the link between RAG security and model fairness.

Conclusion: The study reveals the need to address fairness in RAG systems due to bias-amplifying attacks and proposes a dual-stage defense mechanism.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

*Zhenqiao Song,Tiaoxiao Li,Lei Li,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPDiff, a diffusion model, designs high-affinity protein binders for arbitrary targets using a non-autoregressive approach, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of creating high-affinity protein binders without extensive lab testing drives the need for advanced computational methods.

Method: PPDiff uses SSINC, integrating self-attention, kNN graph layers, and causal attention to model sequence and structure interdependencies.

Result: PPDiff achieves success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and 16.89% in pretraining and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PPDiff demonstrates effectiveness in designing protein binders, offering a scalable solution for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying complex models on edge devices by balancing computational efficiency and accuracy through truncation.

Method: Proposes TruncQuant, a truncation-ready training scheme using bit-shifting for flexible bit precision during runtime.

Result: Demonstrates robustness across bit-width settings and integrates easily with existing quantization-aware frameworks.

Conclusion: TruncQuant offers a practical solution for efficient model deployment on diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

TL;DR: DynaDiag introduces a structured sparse-to-sparse DST method, DynaDiag, which matches unstructured sparsity performance while enabling hardware-friendly speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured sparsity often fails to yield practical speedups on modern hardware, limiting its utility despite reducing parameter counts.

Method: DynaDiag enforces a diagonal sparsity pattern during training, preserving sparse computation in forward/backward passes, and uses a custom CUDA kernel for acceleration.

Result: Empirical results show DynaDiag matches unstructured sparsity accuracy while achieving up to 3.13x inference and 1.59x training speedups on GPUs.

Conclusion: DynaDiag bridges the gap between theoretical sparsity benefits and practical hardware efficiency, offering a viable alternative to unstructured methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

TL;DR: The paper identifies a bias in dynamic fusion strategies like self-attention, where models favor one modality, reducing adaptability. It proposes Rolling Query (RollingQ) to restore balance and improve multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the diminishing adaptability of self-attention models in multimodal learning, where models overly favor one modality, disrupting dynamic fusion.

Method: Introduces Rolling Query (RollingQ), a method to rotate queries and balance attention allocation, breaking the self-reinforcing cycle of modality bias.

Result: Extensive experiments show RollingQ effectively restores adaptability and enhances performance in multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: RollingQ revives the dynamic properties of attention mechanisms, improving the broader capabilities of multimodal Transformers.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data inefficiency in RL for LLMs is a bottleneck; LearnAlign aims to address this by optimizing reasoning data selection.

Method: Uses gradient alignment and data learnability based on success rate to select training data, overcoming response-length bias in gradient norms.

Result: Reduces data requirements significantly (e.g., 1,000 fewer points on GSM8K) with comparable or better performance (77.53% vs. 77.04%).

Conclusion: LearnAlign offers a data-efficient RL post-training approach, with potential for future research in reasoning data optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes is a growing global health concern, necessitating early detection and management. Machine learning offers promising tools for risk prediction.

Method: The study tested Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network Models on 768 samples.

Result: Neural Networks achieved the highest accuracy (78.57%), followed by Random Forests (76.30%).

Conclusion: Machine learning can serve as an effective early screening tool for diabetes, aiding timely intervention and reducing healthcare burdens.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the

TL;DR: Machine learning models were trained on VCUG images to objectively diagnose VUR, achieving high accuracy and identifying renal calyceal deformation as a key predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective grading of VUR introduces variability; machine learning offers a standardized alternative.

Method: Six models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Neural Network) were trained on 113 VCUG images using nine features and evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation.

Result: All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives/negatives, high sensitivity, and strong AUC values.

Conclusion: Machine learning can standardize VUR diagnosis, with renal calyceal deformation as a key predictor. Future work should expand datasets and refine features.

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

*Tung-Long Vuong*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-driven framework for evaluating deep discrete representation learning (DRL), focusing on downstream tasks beyond generation, and analyzes the trade-off between representational capacity and sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL frameworks (e.g., VQ-VAE) focus on generative settings, leaving the usefulness of discrete representations for downstream tasks underexplored and ambiguously defined.

Method: A unified task-driven framework is introduced to evaluate discrete features for downstream tasks, with theoretical analysis of representational capacity vs. sample complexity.

Result: The framework demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness across diverse applications, highlighting the impact of discrete representation utilization on task performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical and theoretical foundation for understanding and applying discrete representations in task-driven settings, beyond generative use cases.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

*Wei Li,Yunyao Cheng,Xinli Hao,Chaohong Ma,Yuxuan Liang,Bin Yang,Christian S. Jensen,Xiaofeng Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates prioritizing alignment paradigms based on time-series primitives over task-specific LLM customization for more efficient and flexible reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for time-series reasoning focus on task-specific models, neglecting intrinsic data primitives, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility.

Method: Proposes three alignment paradigms (Injective, Bridging, Internal) focusing on domain, characteristic, and representation of time-series primitives.

Result: Aligning LLMs with time-series primitives enables economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt alignment-oriented methods, and future research should explore these paradigms further.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Motivation: The mechanism behind ICL is poorly understood, limiting its interpretability, improvement, and reliable application.

Method: Proposes a theoretical perspective viewing ICL as implicit KD, deriving a Rademacher complexity-based generalization bound and analyzing bias growth with MMD.

Result: The framework explains empirical phenomena, unifies prior analyses, and formalizes inference-time attention as distillation.

Conclusion: This work offers theoretical insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection in ICL.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delayformer is a novel framework for predicting high-dimensional time-series data by leveraging delay embedding and Transformers, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of high-dimensional, noisy time-series data is challenging due to nonlinearity and complex interactions, which current methods struggle with.

Method: Delayformer uses a shared ViT encoder to cross-represent delay-embedded states and linear decoders for parallel prediction of all variables.

Result: It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets and shows broad applicability in cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Delayformer is a promising foundational model for time-series forecasting, addressing key challenges in nonlinear and high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often involve unknown or partially known noise statistics, limiting conventional filtering methods. Robust solutions are needed for accurate state estimation in applications like autonomous systems and healthcare.

Method: Leverages Bayesian inference frameworks with deterministic and stochastic techniques (VI, SMC). Studies theoretical limits using BCRBs and validates through simulations and experiments.

Result: Proposed methods show performance gains in target tracking, localization, and other applications. Demonstrates robustness against outliers and missing data.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational solutions for robust state estimation, with potential extensions to outlier-robust machine learning and generative AI challenges.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen,Yongjian Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes multimodal Data Remixing to address modality imbalance and enhance unimodal learning sufficiency in multimodal models, improving accuracy without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance in joint training of multimodal models, leading to modality laziness and clash.

Method: The approach involves decoupling multimodal data, filtering hard samples per modality, and batch-level reassembling to align gradient directions and avoid cross-modal interference.

Result: The method improves accuracy by ~6.50% on CREMAD and ~3.41% on Kinetic-Sounds, integrating seamlessly with existing approaches.

Conclusion: Multimodal Data Remixing effectively mitigates modality imbalance and enhances learning sufficiency, demonstrating practical improvements without additional inference overhead.

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Conclusion: FFMs promise a user-centric, decentralized system for personalized agents in recommendation contexts.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that

Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared

Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user

*Nikolaos Myrtakis,Ioannis Tsamardinos,Vassilis Christophides*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates influence-based signals for debugging training data in ML models, finding that Self-Influence detects mislabeled samples but no signal effectively detects anomalies. Existing signals ignore training dynamics and suffer from influence cancellation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ML model reliability by identifying mislabeled and anomalous samples in noisy training data without dedicated glitch detectors.

Method: Comparative evaluation of influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, TraceIn) across data modalities (image, tabular) and deep learning models.

Result: Self-Influence detects mislabeled samples, but no signal detects anomalies. Signals ignore training dynamics and suffer from influence cancellation.

Conclusion: Current influence-based signals are limited; future work should address training dynamics and influence cancellation for better glitch detection.

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

### [96] [KCES: Training-Free Defense for Robust Graph Neural Networks via Kernel Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11611)
*Yaning Jia,Shenyang Deng,Chiyu Ma,Yaoqing Yang,Soroush Vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KCES is a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework for GNNs that uses Graph Kernel Complexity to identify and prune adversarial edges, improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses often rely on heuristics or overfit to specific attacks. KCES aims to provide a principled, efficient solution.

Method: KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC) to score edges based on their impact on generalization. High-scoring (adversarial) edges are pruned.

Result: KCES enhances GNN robustness, outperforms baselines, and integrates well with other defenses.

Conclusion: KCES offers a practical and effective way to secure GNNs against adversarial attacks without requiring training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

### [97] [Model Organisms for Emergent Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11613)
*Edward Turner,Anna Soligo,Mia Taylor,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models on narrowly harmful datasets can cause broad misalignment, a surprising finding. This work improves understanding and tools for alignment research, achieving higher coherence and efficiency with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unexpected gaps in understanding model alignment, particularly the phenomenon of Emergent Misalignment (EM), and provide tools for future research.

Method: Uses new narrowly misaligned datasets to create improved model organisms, achieving higher coherence and working with smaller models. Demonstrates EM across diverse model sizes, families, and training protocols.

Result: Achieves 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), works with 0.5B parameter models (vs. 32B), and induces misalignment with a single rank-1 LoRA adapter. Identifies a mechanistic phase transition linked to behavioral changes.

Conclusion: Aligning large language models remains a critical challenge for AI safety. This work provides foundational tools and insights for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment risks.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

### [98] [Machine Unlearning for Robust DNNs: Attribution-Guided Partitioning and Neuron Pruning in Noisy Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11615)
*Deliang Jin,Gang Chen,Shuo Feng,Yufeng Ling,Haoran Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combining attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and targeted fine-tuning to mitigate noisy training data impact, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer performance degradation from noisy training data, and existing methods are impractical for large-scale models due to restrictive assumptions or extensive retraining.

Method: Uses gradient-based attribution to distinguish high-quality data, regression-based sensitivity analysis to prune noise-vulnerable neurons, and fine-tunes on clean data.

Result: Achieves ~10% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 with label noise and reduces retraining time by up to 47%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines data-level unlearning with model-level adaptation, offering scalable and robust generalization in noisy environments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

*Anna Soligo,Edward Turner,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can lead to emergent misalignment, where models develop broadly misaligned behaviors. This study uses a minimal model to analyze and mitigate such misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms of emergent misalignment and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, addressing gaps in model alignment knowledge.

Method: Train a minimal model with 9 rank-1 adapters to study misalignment in Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Extract a 'misalignment direction' to ablate misaligned behavior and interpret adapter contributions.

Result: Different misaligned models converge to similar misalignment representations. Six adapters contribute to general misalignment, while two specialize in domain-specific misalignment.

Conclusion: Advancing understanding of emergent misalignment mechanisms can help mitigate such behaviors in large language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

### [100] [Physically-informed change-point kernels for structural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11625)
*Daniel James Pitchforth,Matthew Rhys Jones,Samuel John Gibson,Elizabeth Jane Cross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces change-point kernels for Gaussian processes to dynamically balance physics and data reliance in models, tested on engineering case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the balance between physics and data in models, avoiding over-reliance on inaccurate physics or underuse of valuable physical knowledge.

Method: Develops physically-informed change-point kernels for Gaussian processes, allowing dynamic adjustment of physics reliance based on user-defined conditions or learned automatically.

Result: The new kernels enable interpretable, intuitive control over physics-data balance and better uncertainty capture, demonstrated in bridge wind loading and aircraft wing strain case studies.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances physics and data, enhancing model adaptability and interpretability in varying conditions.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

### [101] [Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11700)
*Katharina Limbeck,Lydia Mezrag,Guy Wolf,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel graph pooling layers for GNNs that preserve graph structures and interpretability, outperforming existing methods in performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pooling layers in GNNs often compromise graph structures and interpretability for task performance, leading to unreliable results.

Method: Proposes structure-aware pooling via edge collapses, leveraging diffusion geometry and diversity measures like magnitude and spread.

Result: Achieves superior performance, preserves spectral properties, and maintains accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed pooling layers offer a robust solution for graph-based tasks by balancing performance and structural fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

### [102] [Growing with Experience: Growing Neural Networks in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11706)
*Lukas Fehring,Marius Lindauer,Theresa Eimer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrowNN is a method for training RL networks by progressively growing them during training, improving performance over static networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large RL networks is challenging, limiting policy complexity. GrowNN aims to increase capacity while maintaining trainability.

Method: Start with a small network, then add layers without altering the encoded function, allowing incremental policy complexity.

Result: Experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show GrowNN outperforms static networks by up to 48% and 72%.

Conclusion: GrowNN effectively enhances RL agent performance by dynamically increasing network capacity.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

### [103] [Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743)
*Antonin Joly,Nicolas Keriven,Aline Roumy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a more flexible definition of reduction matrices in graph coarsening, not strictly tied to lifting matrices, to minimize information loss (RSA) and explores their impact on graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coarsening frameworks rigidly link reduction and lifting matrices, limiting optimization. The paper seeks to generalize reduction matrices to improve RSA and graph task performance.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of admissible reduction matrices, explores their properties, and demonstrates RSA reduction via modified reduction matrices, including optimization-based examples.

Result: Shows that modifying reduction matrices for fixed lifting matrices can further reduce RSA, with examples and impact on Graph Neural Networks' node classification tasks.

Conclusion: Generalizing reduction matrices beyond pseudo-inverses of lifting matrices enhances coarsening flexibility and performance, validated by improved RSA and task outcomes.

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

*Markus Gambietz,Eva Dorschky,Altan Akat,Marcel Schöckel,Jörg Miehling,Anne D. Koelewijn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSPINNpose is a self-supervised, physics-informed neural network for real-time estimation of joint kinematics and kinetics from IMU data, eliminating the need for ground truth labels and demonstrating high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current real-time methods for human movement dynamics rely on supervised learning with ground truth data from lab systems, which are error-prone and impractical for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes SSPINNpose, a neural network trained directly on IMU data using a physics model to ensure plausibility and generate virtual measurements, bypassing the need for labeled data.

Result: Achieves RMSD of 8.7 deg for joint angles and 4.9 BWBH% for joint moments, with low latency (3.5 ms) and robustness across sparse sensor configurations.

Conclusion: SSPINNpose offers a scalable, adaptable solution for real-time biomechanical analysis in diverse environments, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

*Gregor Baer,Isel Grau,Chao Zhang,Pieter Van Gorp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates class-dependent evaluation effects in XAI, showing that perturbation-based metrics and ground truth metrics often contradict each other, raising concerns about their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which class-dependent evaluation effects arise in XAI, given the unreliability of perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable.

Method: Controlled experiments with synthetic time series data, varying feature types and class contrasts, comparing perturbation-based and ground truth metrics.

Result: Class-dependent effects occur even in simple scenarios, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches, leading to contradictory assessments of attribution quality.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based metrics should be interpreted cautiously, and more comprehensive evaluation frameworks are needed to capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

*Hwiwon Lee,Ziqi Zhang,Hanxiao Lu,Lingming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEC-bench is an automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on real security tasks, revealing significant performance gaps in PoC generation (18.0%) and vulnerability patching (34.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack realism for security engineering tasks, necessitating a framework like SEC-bench for authentic evaluation.

Method: SEC-bench uses a multi-agent scaffold to create reproducible vulnerability datasets and evaluates LLM agents on PoC generation and vulnerability patching.

Result: LLM agents achieved low success rates: 18.0% in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the need for improved LLM agents to be practical and autonomous in security engineering.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TrustGLM, a study evaluating GraphLLMs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks in text, graph structure, and prompts, revealing significant weaknesses and proposing defense techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial attacks is unexplored, posing risks for high-stakes applications.

Method: TrustGLM assesses GraphLLMs using state-of-the-art attack algorithms on text, graph structure, and prompts across six benchmark datasets.

Result: GraphLLMs are highly vulnerable to text and graph structure attacks, and prompt shuffling causes performance drops. Defense techniques like adversarial training show promise.

Conclusion: The study highlights GraphLLMs' vulnerabilities and proposes defenses, encouraging further research with an open-sourced library.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

### [109] [Regression-adjusted Monte Carlo Estimators for Shapley Values and Probabilistic Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11849)
*R. Teal Witter,Yurong Liu,Christopher Musco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible method combining Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression to efficiently estimate probabilistic values like Shapley values, outperforming existing techniques in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic values (e.g., Shapley, Banzhaf) are key in explainable AI but computationally expensive. Current methods (Monte Carlo, linear regression) have limitations, prompting a need for a more flexible and accurate approach.

Method: The proposed method integrates Monte Carlo sampling with any function family (e.g., tree-based models like XGBoost) for efficient computation of probabilistic values, ensuring unbiased estimates.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing error significantly (e.g., 6.5× lower than Permutation SHAP for Shapley values).

Conclusion: The new approach offers superior accuracy and flexibility for estimating probabilistic values, advancing explainable AI tools.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

*Jina Kim,Jeffrey Willette,Bruno Andreis,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach improves generalization for molecular prediction models by leveraging unlabeled data to bridge in-distribution and out-of-distribution gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular prediction models struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution compounds, a critical issue in drug discovery due to covariate shift and limited labeled data.

Method: A novel meta-learning-based approach uses unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, enhancing generalization.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on real-world datasets with significant covariate shift.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learning framework effectively addresses generalization challenges in molecular prediction, offering improved reliability for drug discovery.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An XRL framework for dynamic network slicing in vehicular networks improves interpretability and QoS for URLLC and eMBB services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diverse service demands and reliability challenges in vehicular networks.

Method: Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) with Shapley values and attention mechanisms.

Result: Improved QoS satisfaction (URLLC: 78.0% to 80.13%, eMBB: 71.44% to 73.21%) and higher interpretability.

Conclusion: The XRL framework enhances real-time decision-making and interpretability in resource allocation.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular
networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By
integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an
attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our
reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in
vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our
approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation
process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention
mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC
services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved
from 71.44% to 73.21%.

*Ningyuan Huang,Miguel Sarabia,Abhinav Moudgil,Pau Rodriguez,Luca Zappella,Federico Danieli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demystifies the role of input selectivity in Mamba, showing its advantages in function approximation, memory retention, and associative recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how Mamba leverages input selectivity and its interactions with other operations, addressing gaps in understanding its performance improvements.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation of Mamba's S6 layer, focusing on function approximation, memory decay, and associative recall tasks.

Result: Mamba's S6 layer outperforms S4D in approximating discontinuous functions, dynamically counteracts memory decay, and solves associative recall tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The study provides mechanistic insights into Mamba, highlighting its strengths and potential areas for further enhancement.

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compact transformer is proposed for robust modulation classification, addressing vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks by transferring adversarial attention maps from larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are widely used but vulnerable to adversarial attacks in modulation classification, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT.

Method: Proposes a compact transformer with adversarial attention map transfer from a robustly trained large transformer to enhance robustness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques against white-box adversarial attacks like FGM and PGD.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness and mitigates adversarial transferability, making it suitable for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with conflicting signals in prior and measurement, especially under non-Gaussian or unknown noise.

Method: Introduces MAS, unifying and extending approaches like DDNM and DAPS, with an optimization perspective to handle various noise types.

Result: MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MAS offers a flexible and effective solution for inverse problems, even with challenging noise conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

TL;DR: Scalable algorithms for online learning and Bayesian inference in neural networks, combining frequentist and Bayesian filtering for efficient updates and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient online learning and decision-making in neural networks without replay buffers or offline retraining.

Method: Combines low-rank updates for hidden layers and full-rank updates for the final layer, ensuring a well-defined posterior predictive distribution.

Result: Achieves a competitive balance between speed and accuracy in non-stationary tasks like contextual bandits and Bayesian optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a practical solution for online learning and decision-making in neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

TL;DR: A defense system called neural rejection is proposed to counter universal adversarial perturbations in deep learning-based radio signal classification, showing higher accuracy than undefended networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning excels in radio signal classification but is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, especially universal ones, which degrade performance.

Method: The paper introduces a neural rejection system and evaluates it by generating white-box universal adversarial perturbations.

Result: The proposed system defends against universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher accuracy than undefended networks.

Conclusion: The neural rejection system effectively mitigates the impact of universal adversarial perturbations in radio signal classification.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeRL integrates on-policy tree search into RL for LLMs, improving exploration and efficiency without needing a separate reward model, outperforming ChainRL in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL with chain sampling lacks efficient exploration and dense rewards, while separate reward models face issues like distribution mismatch.

Method: TreeRL incorporates on-policy tree search with intermediate supervision and strategic branching from high-uncertainty steps.

Result: TreeRL outperforms ChainRL in math and code reasoning benchmarks, achieving higher efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: TreeRL demonstrates the potential of tree search in LLM RL, offering a cost-effective and superior alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

TL;DR: XAStruct is a machine learning framework for predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input, trained on a diverse dataset for broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for expert-driven analysis and computationally expensive simulations in XAS interpretation limits its accessibility and efficiency.

Method: XAStruct uses deep neural networks for complex mappings and baseline models for simpler tasks, trained on a large-scale dataset spanning 70+ elements.

Result: The framework achieves generalization across chemistries and bonding environments, with independent training ensuring optimal performance for each task.

Conclusion: XAStruct provides a scalable, extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis, with potential for broad impact in spectroscopy.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

*Miguel Suau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The advantage function in reinforcement learning not only reduces gradient variance but also mitigates policy confounding by breaking spurious correlations, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing policy confounding, where agents exploit spurious correlations due to feedback loops, hindering generalization.

Method: Using the advantage function to adjust action values relative to state representation, downweighting policy-biased state-action pairs.

Result: Analytical and empirical evidence shows improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Conclusion: The advantage function effectively reduces policy confounding and enhances generalization in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores treating self-supervised image pre-training as an RL problem, learning a general value function to improve feature representations on unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between RL and self-supervised learning by leveraging RL techniques for feature learning in unlabeled image data.

Method: Casts pre-training as an RL problem, training a value function where an agent transforms images (e.g., via crops or augmentations) to learn associations.

Result: Improved feature representations on diverse unlabeled datasets like EpicKitchens, COCO, and CC12M.

Conclusion: RL-inspired pre-training offers a flexible and effective approach for self-supervised learning on unlabeled image data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based traffic control protocol for free-flow roads improves throughput and reduces congestion without new infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing traffic congestion in free-flow road networks due to increased commuter inflow and limited infrastructure, with traditional control methods being ineffective.

Method: Integrates traffic flow theory, gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL framework, using super-segments to capture flow dynamics.

Result: Improves throughput by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% in simulations.

Conclusion: The method shows potential for scalable, ML-driven traffic management with smoother, congestion-resistant flow.

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIMSHIFT, a benchmark for evaluating neural surrogates in PDEs under unseen configurations, and applies domain adaptation techniques to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates for PDEs perform poorly on unseen configurations, while domain adaptation (DA) techniques in vision/language show promise for generalization.

Method: Extends DA methods to neural surrogates, using parametric descriptions and simulations from source configurations to predict target simulations without ground truth.

Result: Experiments on SIMSHIFT reveal challenges in out-of-distribution surrogate modeling but demonstrate DA's potential in simulation tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights open problems in robust neural surrogates for industrial scenarios and provides a codebase for further research.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Motivation: Balancing efficiency and robustness in safety-critical, resource-constrained environments where existing methods treat compression and robustness separately.

Method: Proposes CACTUS, a framework for unified training of compression and certified robustness, applied to pruning and quantization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and certified performance for pruning and quantization across datasets.

Conclusion: CACTUS effectively trains models that remain efficient and robust when compressed.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained
environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat
compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either
efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training
Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during
training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed.
We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high

and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

TL;DR: EMLoC is a memory-efficient framework for fine-tuning large foundation models, using an emulator and LoRA correction to stay within inference memory limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large models is expensive due to high memory overhead, limiting accessibility for domain-specific or personalized tasks.

Method: EMLoC uses activation-aware SVD to create a lightweight emulator, fine-tunes it via LoRA, and corrects misalignment with a novel compensation algorithm.

Result: EMLoC outperforms baselines across datasets and enables fine-tuning a 38B model on a 24GB GPU.

Conclusion: EMLoC provides a practical, efficient solution for individual users to adapt large models.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

TL;DR: The paper introduces pLSTMs, a parallelizable extension of linear RNNs for multi-dimensional data like DAGs, addressing limitations of modern architectures like xLSTM and Mamba.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recurrent architectures (e.g., xLSTM, Mamba) are limited to sequences or require pre-defined orders for multi-dimensional data. MDRNNs are better suited but lack parallelization. This work aims to extend multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs for DAGs.

Method: Proposes pLSTMs with Source, Transition, and Mark gates acting on DAG line graphs, enabling parallelization. Uses einsum operations for efficient implementation on grids (1D/2D). Addresses vanishing/exploding gradients via P-mode and D-mode.

Result: pLSTMs generalize well to larger image sizes and outperform Transformers in long-range tasks like arrow-pointing extrapolation. Strong performance on molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: pLSTMs effectively handle multi-dimensional data with parallelization, addressing long-distance challenges in DAGs, and outperform existing architectures in generalization and extrapolation tasks.

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Method: Proposes prediction-based arithmetic coding for compression, enhanced by pruning and quantization of checkpoint values.

Result: Substantial bit size reduction with near-lossless training recovery, maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for storage-limited environments, balancing compression and recovery quality.

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid CV models are resource-intensive for edge deployment, and existing PTQ methods are limited for such models.

Method: Proposes EfficientQuant, applying uniform quantization to convolutional blocks and log2 quantization to transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves 2.5× - 8.7× latency reduction with minimal accuracy loss on ImageNet-1K and shows efficiency on edge devices.

Conclusion: EfficientQuant is practical for real-world deployment due to its low latency and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining ESRGAN for image enhancement and Faster R-CNN for object detection to improve detection in low-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate object detection in low-resolution or inconsistent-quality images.

Method: Uses ESRGAN to enhance low-resolution images as a pre-processing step, followed by Faster R-CNN for detection.

Result: The integrated approach outperforms traditional methods on low-resolution inputs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust solution for object detection in scenarios with variable or limited image quality.

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

*Yifei Chen,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces enhancements to the RefAV framework for scenario mining in autonomous driving, addressing LLM-generated code errors and spatial-relationship inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reliability and precision of scenario mining from autonomous driving datasets like Argoverse 2 by refining LLM-generated code and spatial-relationship interpretation.

Method: Two key enhancements: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism, and (2) specialized prompt engineering for better LLM comprehension of spatial relationships.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains, achieving a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the Argoverse 2 test set with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance the reliability and precision of scenario mining, validating their efficacy.

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on classifying iron ore pellets using the StarDist algorithm for accurate quality assessment, improving traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify and analyze objects in dense, unstable environments for quality control in pellet production.

Method: Utilizes the StarDist algorithm for segmenting, contouring, classifying, and measuring pellet dimensions.

Result: Developed a novel method for detecting objects with smoothed boundaries, enhancing measurement accuracy and size distribution analysis.

Conclusion: The StarDist-based approach offers a robust solution for pellet classification and measurement challenges.

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT introduces an efficient image segmentation model using foveated input images and variable-resolution patch tokenization to reduce computational cost without shrinking the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in image segmentation by focusing on the region of interest, avoiding the need to reduce model size.

Method: Extracts a crop centered on a point prompt and applies variable-resolution patch tokenization, downsampling patches farther from the prompt.

Result: STT is more efficient than prior work, competitive on benchmarks, and runs at interactive frame rates on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: STT is a promising tool for augmented reality and robotics due to its efficiency and focus on regions of interest.

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines gender fairness in ML/DL models for pain detection using facial expressions, finding biases despite high accuracy, especially with ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing under-researched accuracy and fairness of pain detection algorithms across demographic groups, focusing on gender.

Method: Evaluated traditional ML (L SVM, RBF SVM) and DL (CNN, ViT) models on the UNBC-McMaster database using performance and fairness metrics.

Result: ViT achieved highest accuracy but all models showed gender biases, revealing an accuracy-fairness trade-off.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware techniques are needed to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

TL;DR: A method for estimating 3D hand articulation from 2D keypoints without needing camera parameters, using keypoint alignment and fingertip loss, showing competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of 3D hand articulation from a single color image is challenging due to lack of depth, occlusions, and complexity. Existing methods often require camera parameters, which this work aims to overcome.

Method: Proposes an optimization pipeline with keypoint alignment and fingertip loss to eliminate the need for camera parameters. Evaluated on EgoDexter and Dexter+Object benchmarks.

Result: Competes with state-of-the-art methods and shows robustness on 'in-the-wild' images without prior camera knowledge. Sensitivity to 2D keypoint accuracy is noted.

Conclusion: The approach effectively estimates 3D hand articulation without camera parameters, demonstrating robustness and competitive performance, though dependent on accurate 2D keypoints.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ContextLoss (CLoss), a novel loss function for image segmentation that improves topological correctness by considering errors in their full context, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological errors in segmented structures (e.g., roads, vessels) can impact functionality (e.g., navigation). Existing solutions lack context-aware error handling.

Method: Introduces CLoss, which leverages the full context of topological errors in critical pixel masks. Also proposes two metrics to validate connectivity improvements.

Result: CLoss repairs up to 44% more missed connections and enhances performance on topology-aware metrics across 2D/3D datasets.

Conclusion: CLoss effectively improves topological accuracy in segmentation tasks, with publicly available code for broader use.

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR is a lightweight, attention-based feature upsampler that enhances spatial resolution for Foundation Vision Encoders, outperforming existing methods without high-resolution supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Vision Encoders produce low-resolution features, requiring upsampling for high-resolution downstream tasks. Existing methods lack flexibility and performance.

Method: JAFAR uses an attention-based module with Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation to align high-resolution queries and low-resolution keys.

Result: JAFAR recovers fine-grained details and outperforms existing upsampling methods across diverse tasks, generalizing well to higher scales.

Conclusion: JAFAR is an effective, flexible solution for feature upsampling, improving performance without high-resolution supervision.

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

TL;DR: Agentic AI using LLMs autonomously builds a computer vision system for medical image analysis, achieving high accuracy in segmenting lungs, heart, and ribs from chest X-rays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI systems for automating complex tasks like computer vision system planning and tool configuration, traditionally done by data scientists.

Method: Extending the SimpleMind AI environment with an LLM-based agent to interpret prompts, plan workflows, and configure tools for medical image segmentation.

Result: The system autonomously configured, trained, and tested on 50 chest X-rays, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96 (lungs), 0.82 (heart), and 0.83 (ribs).

Conclusion: Agentic AI can autonomously perform planning and tool configuration for computer vision tasks, reducing reliance on human experts.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has

*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation improves performance by leveraging uncertainty, dynamic weighting, class rebalancing, and contrastive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in SSSS like ineffective pseudo-label use, class imbalance, and ignored uncertainty.

Method: Uses fuzzy pseudo-labeling, uncertainty-aware weighting, adaptive class rebalancing, and contrastive regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for underrepresented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: The proposed holistic framework effectively transforms uncertainty into a learning asset, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman improves human video generation by optimizing motion naturalness and visual fidelity using timestep-segment preference optimization and specialized LoRAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between motion naturalness and visual fidelity in human animation.

Method: Combines Preference Optimization with a divide-and-conquer strategy, using timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO) and two specialized LoRAs for expert alignment.

Result: Achieves a 3.3× speedup (100 to 30 NFEs) with minimal quality loss, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: AlignHuman effectively balances motion and fidelity, enhancing efficiency and quality in human video generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Conclusion: 3D-RAD and its training set 3D-RAD-T aim to drive multimodal medical AI research, providing a foundation for 3D medical visual understanding.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for

medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language

particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a

Motivation: Existing LLM-to-3D models lack physical knowledge, leading to outputs that ignore real-world constraints. This gap limits their use in engineering design.

Method: LLM-to-Phy3D introduces an online black-box refinement loop using visual and physics-based evaluations to iteratively improve prompts for physically conforming 3D objects.

Result: Evaluations show LLM-to-Phy3D improves physical conformity by 4.5% to 106.7% over conventional models, with notable success in vehicle design optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D demonstrates significant potential for Physical AI in scientific and engineering applications, bridging the gap between generative AI and physical viability.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

Motivation: The problem of recovering mental targets from EEG and image data lacks solutions for unlabeled scenarios, which CURSOR addresses.

Method: CURSOR learns to recover unknown mental targets without labeled data or pre-trained decoders, using image similarity scores and ranking stimuli.

Result: CURSOR predicts image similarity scores correlating with human judgments, ranks stimuli, and generates indistinguishable stimuli (validated by N=53).

Conclusion: CURSOR successfully recovers mental targets without labeled data, demonstrating practical applications in brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption, an automatic framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), addresses issues in video captioning benchmarks by generating diverse and detailed captions, leading to improved evaluation and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning benchmarks suffer from inadequate key points, high data creation costs, and limited evaluation scopes, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Proposes AutoCaption, leveraging MCTS to iteratively create diverse and detailed captions, forming the MCTS-VCB benchmark for evaluating MLLMs.

Result: Gemini-1.5-Pro scores highest (71.2 F1) on MCTS-VCB; fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with AutoCaption data improves performance by 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on DREAM-1K.

Conclusion: AutoCaption effectively enhances video captioning benchmarks and model performance, demonstrating its utility for comprehensive evaluation and training.

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files

TL;DR: The paper explores VLMs' ability to perform social reasoning, identifying a gap in visual social-pragmatic inference, and proposes a new task and dataset to benchmark VLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social behavior, especially non-verbal cues, is challenging. While LLMs excel in text, VLMs' potential for social reasoning is understudied.

Method: The authors propose a new task (Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference), create a dataset, and benchmark several VLMs.

Result: The study identifies a gap in VLMs' ability to infer social cues, highlighting limitations in their social reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VLMs currently lack robust social reasoning skills, and the proposed task and dataset provide a foundation for future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method uses synthetic data to visualize Earth's subsurface, improving with borehole data, for applications like resource exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of visualizing Earth's subsurface for applications like resource exploration and hazard assessment drives the need for innovative deep learning solutions.

Method: The approach involves training a neural network on synthetic data mimicking geological processes, supplemented by surface and borehole data, using generative flow matching.

Result: The model generates 3D subsurface images with high fidelity, depicting geological structures like layers and faults, improving with more borehole data.

Conclusion: This method shows promise for subsurface visualization and can be fine-tuned for specific regions, serving as an AI-based regularizer in traditional inverse problems.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using WiFi-based CSI datasets, considering their real-world applications in healthcare and smart homes.

Method: Performance comparison of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models on two datasets (UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR), analyzing accuracy and feature extraction capabilities.

Result: CNN+GRU achieves 95.20% accuracy on UT-HAR (spatial features), while BiLSTM scores 92.05% on NTU-Fi HAR (temporal dependencies). Dataset traits and preprocessing significantly impact performance.

Conclusion: Model performance depends on dataset characteristics; CNN+GRU and BiLSTM excel in different contexts. The study underscores the potential of these models for unobtrusive HAR in real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework enhances LLMs' reasoning for medical image diagnosis using test-time scaling, improving accuracy across imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored application of LLMs in visual question answering for medical imaging and the impracticality of supervised fine-tuning due to data and cost constraints.

Method: A vision-language model processes medical images and textual prompts to generate visual feature interpretations, which are consolidated by an LLM using test-time scaling for reliable diagnosis.

Result: The framework improves diagnostic accuracy across radiology, ophthalmology, and histopathology, with unbiased prompting enhancing reliability and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot framework effectively enhances LLM reasoning for medical image diagnosis, offering a practical solution for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Result: It achieves top performance in age/gender prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and more across datasets from multiple countries.

Conclusion: NeuroSTORM offers a standardized, open-source foundation model to enhance reproducibility and transferability in fMRI research.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain

face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveFormer is a lightweight transformer-based model for sEMG gesture recognition, achieving high accuracy (95%) with low computational cost (3.1M parameters) and real-time performance (6.75 ms latency).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying similar gestures with nearly identical sEMG signals is challenging, and traditional deep learning models are too large for embedded systems.

Method: WaveFormer integrates time and frequency features via a learnable wavelet transform, using a WaveletConv module for efficient decomposition.

Result: Achieves 95% accuracy on EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models, and enables real-time deployment with INT8 quantization.

Conclusion: WaveFormer offers a compact, efficient solution for accurate sEMG gesture recognition on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

*Hongyu Chen,Jiping Liu,Yong Wang,Jun Zhu,Dejun Feng,Yakun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SF-TMAT, a benchmark for UAV object detection in adverse scenes, using dynamic feedback mechanisms to improve feature alignment and pseudo-label quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods fail in UAV imagery under adverse conditions due to poor feature alignment and noisy pseudo-labels.

Method: Introduces DSFMA for dynamic mask adjustment and VFST for adaptive pseudo-label thresholding.

Result: SF-TMAT outperforms existing methods in UAV object detection under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: SF-TMAT effectively addresses domain gaps and improves detection accuracy in challenging UAV scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMAP is a multimodal graph learning framework for efficiently identifying neurodegenerative disease-affected brain regions, reducing computational overhead by 50% and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods lack localization of disease-relevant brain regions and suffer from high computational complexity, limiting practical use.

Method: BrainMAP uses atlas-driven filtering to extract critical subgraphs and employs multimodal fusion with cross-node attention and adaptive gating for fMRI and DTI data.

Result: BrainMAP reduces computational overhead by over 50% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: BrainMAP offers a precise and computationally efficient solution for neurodegenerative disease detection, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model improves vehicle speed detection accuracy, lane identification, and vehicle classification (cars vs. heavy vehicles) for traffic monitoring in California.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in vehicle numbers and inadequate transportation systems in California require better speed detection methods, especially for HOV lanes and heavy vehicle restrictions.

Method: The study uses a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model trained on 800 bird's-eye view images, analyzing factors like drone height and ROI distance.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute error of 0.97 mph and mean squared error of 0.94 mph², outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses vehicle speed detection and classification challenges, proving practical for traffic regulation.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Motivation: Addresses limitations of data-tracing unlearning for diverse requests in foundation models and aligns with human cognitive forgetting processes.

Method: Proposes knowledge-tracing unlearning, supported by practical needs and cognitive studies, illustrated with a vision-language FM case study.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and alignment of knowledge-tracing unlearning with human cognition and practical requirements.

Conclusion: Knowledge-tracing unlearning is a viable and practical approach for foundation models, better suited for diverse unlearning requests.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments change dynamically in space and time, posing challenges for accurate modeling. STRIDE addresses this by capturing interconnected spatial and temporal dynamics.

Method: STRIDE permutes 360-degree panoramic imagery into observation, state, and action nodes. TARDIS, a transformer-based model, integrates these dynamics through an autoregressive framework.

Result: TARDIS achieves robust performance in photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous control, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: STRIDE and TARDIS advance generalist agents' ability to understand and manipulate spatio-temporal dynamics, enhancing embodied reasoning.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GynSurg, a large, diverse dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, addressing limitations of existing datasets to enhance surgical analysis and assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for gynecologic laparoscopy are limited in scale, task focus, or annotation detail, hindering comprehensive workflow analysis.

Method: The authors introduce GynSurg, a multi-task dataset with rich annotations for action recognition, semantic segmentation, and more, and benchmark state-of-the-art models.

Result: GynSurg is demonstrated to be high-quality and versatile, supporting various applications in surgical analysis.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly released to accelerate progress in surgical video analysis and computer-assisted intervention.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

### [159] [A Watermark for Auto-Regressive Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11371)
*Yihan Wu,Xuehao Cui,Ruibo Chen,Georgios Milis,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-reweight is a new watermarking method for image generation models, addressing retokenization mismatch and improving detectability without distorting images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of misuse potential in image generation (e.g., deepfakes) necessitates robust authenticity verification, but traditional watermarking methods face challenges in image models.

Method: C-reweight uses a clustering-based strategy to treat tokens equivalently, mitigating retokenization mismatch while preserving image quality.

Result: Evaluations show C-reweight maintains visual quality and outperforms existing distortion-free watermarking techniques in detectability.

Conclusion: C-reweight sets a new standard for secure and trustworthy image synthesis by balancing fidelity and detectability.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Nikos Deligiannis,Aleksandra Pižurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method for hyperspectral images (HSIs) that jointly captures local and non-local structures, reducing complexity to O(n).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods for HSIs are computationally intensive (O(n^2)) and lack effective supervision of the entire clustering process by either local or non-local constraints alone.

Method: Proposes a one-stage approach with spatial smoothness (local) and mini-cluster-based (non-local) constraints, jointly optimized for efficiency (O(n) complexity).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method is scalable, efficient, and effective for large-scale HSI clustering, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

### [161] [Enhance Multimodal Consistency and Coherence for Text-Image Plan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11380)
*Xiaoxin Lu,Ranran Haoran Zhang,Yusen Zhang,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating text-image plans addresses alignment and coherence challenges, improving multimodal task planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research lacks focus on multimodal (text-image) task planning, leaving alignment and coherence challenges unaddressed.

Method: Proposes a step-by-step framework: drafts textual steps, edits visual steps, extracts PDDL-like info, and refines drafts iteratively.

Result: Effective on benchmarks with 1,100 tasks, outperforming baselines on multimodal consistency and coherence metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enhances multimodal task planning, offering plug-and-play improvements for models like Mistral-7B and GPT-4o.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower to enhance VQA models by improving spatial reasoning and cross-modal interaction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods struggle with complex reasoning due to weak cross-modal interaction and poor spatial relationship capture.

Method: Proposes a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower with four layers, inspired by human gestalt vision, to better organize and perceive image content.

Result: The module works with any multimodal model, achieving advanced results, and the July model sets state-of-the-art performance with 3B parameters.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves spatial reasoning in VQA, demonstrating broad applicability and superior performance.

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

*Dokyoon Yoon,Youngsook Song,Woomyong Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a preference learning method, \mymethod, to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by targeting specific areas where errors occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate incorrect information about objects not present in input images, undermining reliability in vision-language tasks.

Method: A dataset with hallucinated and correct responses is built, and preference learning is applied to target specific areas where hallucinations occur.

Result: The method effectively reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks without degrading overall model performance.

Conclusion: \mymethod improves MLLM reliability by focusing on correcting hallucinations in targeted areas.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

*Jingfeng Guo,Jian Liu,Jinnan Chen,Shiwei Mao,Changrong Hu,Puhua Jiang,Junlin Yu,Jing Xu,Qi Liu,Lixin Xu,Zhuo Chen,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Auto-Connect introduces a connectivity-preserving tokenization scheme for automatic rigging, enhancing topological accuracy and skinning quality through reward-guided optimization and geodesic-aware bone selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automatic rigging either predict bone positions as two joints or determine connectivity separately, leading to topological inaccuracies. Auto-Connect aims to preserve skeletal connectivity explicitly.

Method: The method uses connectivity-preserving tokens to define joint endpoints and hierarchical layers, integrates a topology-aware reward function for post-training optimization, and employs geodesic features for latent bone selection.

Result: The approach generates anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties, significantly improving topological accuracy and skinning quality.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect's combination of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and geodesic-aware selection consistently produces high-quality skeletal rigs.

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

*Jie Zhu,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FSCA, a black-box auditing framework for text-to-image diffusion models, addressing copyright and privacy issues without needing internal model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auditing methods for text-to-image diffusion models rely on unrealistic assumptions or unreliable evaluations, leaving gaps in copyright compliance and privacy protection.

Method: FSCA uses semantic connections within the model for auditing, avoiding internal knowledge access. It includes recall balance and threshold adjustment strategies.

Result: FSCA outperforms eight baselines on LAION-mi and COCO datasets, achieving 90% user-level accuracy with minimal samples.

Conclusion: FSCA is effective and practical for real-world auditing, with strong performance and minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

*Ziyang Luo,Nian Liu,Xuguang Yang,Salman Khan,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Hisham Cholakkal,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAViS is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) that aligns audio and visual modalities by coupling multimodal foundation models (ImageBind) with a segmentation model (SAM2), using a text-bridged design for improved cross-modal alignment and supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aligning audio and visual modalities in AVS, where existing methods fail to address cross-modal alignment effectively.

Method: TAViS combines ImageBind for cross-modal alignment and SAM2 for segmentation, using a text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism and alignment supervision strategy.

Result: Superior performance on single-source, multi-source, semantic datasets, and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: TAViS effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges in AVS by leveraging multimodal foundation models and text-bridged supervision.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive learning model with uncertainty awareness improves cancer subtyping by selectively labeling crucial images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cancer subtyping models by incorporating uncertainty awareness, reducing reliance on extensive labeled datasets while improving precision.

Method: Introduces uncertainty awareness via an evidence vector to assess prediction confidence, using the uncertainty score to guide selective annotation and iterative training refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1-10% of strategically selected annotations on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method efficiently minimizes annotation needs and improves classification precision, offering a promising approach for digital pathology with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V2LMs (Vehicle Vision Language Models) outperform traditional DNNs in AV perception by maintaining high accuracy under adversarial attacks without adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs in AVs are vulnerable to attacks, and existing defenses degrade performance. V2LMs aim to provide robust and secure perception.

Method: Fine-tuned vision-language models (V2LMs) are introduced, evaluated in Solo Mode (task-specific) and Tandem Mode (multi-task).

Result: V2LMs reduce accuracy drops to <8% under attacks, compared to 33-46% for DNNs. Tandem Mode is memory-efficient and equally robust.

Conclusion: V2LMs enhance AV perception security and resilience, offering a promising alternative to traditional DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a lightweight spatio-temporal framework for attributing face-swap Deepfakes to their generative models, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of face-swap Deepfake videos threatens digital security and media integrity, but model attribution (identifying the source model) is underexplored compared to binary detection.

Method: FAME uses multilevel embeddings with spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to capture model-specific artifacts efficiently.

Result: FAME outperforms existing methods on datasets DFDM, FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb in accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: FAME is effective for real-world forensic applications due to its accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

### [170] [Environmental Change Detection: Toward a Practical Task of Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11481)
*Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Hongje Seong,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Environmental Change Detection (ECD), a practical task for detecting scene changes using unaligned reference images, and proposes a novel framework leveraging multiple references for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Scene Change Detection (SCD) assumes perfectly aligned query-reference pairs, which is unrealistic. ECD addresses this by using environmental cues from uncurated images.

Method: The framework jointly understands spatial environments and detects changes by aggregating semantically rich representations from multiple reference candidates.

Result: The method outperforms naive combinations of state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable performance to the oracle setting on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: ECD is a practical advancement in change detection, with the proposed framework effectively handling viewpoint misalignment and limited FOV.

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other

These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world

Motivation: Existing UDA methods using multi-modal pre-trained models suffer from deviations in visual embedding distributions between domains, leading to misguided signals. The work aims to enhance pseudo-labels and target-prompt learning by exploiting embedding geometry.

Result: Experiments show superior performance and better representation quality of target prompts compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of current UDA approaches by utilizing embedding geometry, leading to improved generalization and pseudo-label quality.

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

### [173] [Manager: Aggregating Insights from Unimodal Experts in Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11515)
*Xiao Xu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manager, a plugin for Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs, enhancing performance by adaptively aggregating unimodal expert insights. It outperforms baselines on VL tasks and boosts zero-shot performance in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in layer-by-layer unimodal representation use and limited semantic exploitation in BridgeTower, and to extend evaluation beyond low-resolution datasets.

Method: Proposes ManagerTower, integrating a manager in each cross-modal layer for adaptive aggregation of unimodal expert insights, tested under Two-Tower VLM and MLLM architectures.

Result: ManagerTower outperforms baselines on 4 VL tasks; LLaVA-OV-Manager enhances zero-shot performance across 20 datasets, improving visual representation diversity.

Conclusion: Manager and multi-grid algorithm synergize to mitigate semantic ambiguity and improve performance, demonstrating effectiveness as plugins for VLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

*Samuel Cerezo,Javier Civera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GNSS-inertial initialization strategy delays global GNSS measurements until sufficient data is available, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor initial estimates from limited measurements can lead to local minima in non-linear optimization, necessitating a better initialization method.

Method: Uses GNSS relative distance residuals initially and switches to global measurements based on Hessian matrix singular values.

Result: Outperforms naive global GNSS usage, providing more accurate and robust initializations on EuRoC and GVINS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy enhances initialization accuracy by optimizing the timing of global GNSS measurement integration.

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

*Zhuguanyu Wu,Shihe Wang,Jiayi Zhang,Jiaxin Chen,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIMA-Q, a novel post-training quantization method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses accuracy degradation in low-bit quantization by leveraging KL divergence and a new FIM approximation (DPLR-FIM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PTQ methods for ViTs suffer from significant accuracy loss, especially in low-bit settings, due to limitations in Hessian-guided quantization loss.

Method: The authors propose FIMA-Q, which connects KL divergence with Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for fast quantization loss computation and introduces DPLR-FIM, an efficient FIM approximation method.

Result: Experiments show FIMA-Q outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods, especially in low-bit quantization, across various ViT architectures and vision tasks.

Conclusion: FIMA-Q effectively mitigates accuracy degradation in PTQ for ViTs, offering a practical solution for low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Result: Outperforms bi-temporal baselines, validated on real-world and synthetic datasets. Analyzes impact of timesteps, key components, and scalability across disaster types.

Conclusion: SITS-Extreme offers scalable, accurate detection for large-scale disaster monitoring.

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing

TL;DR: The paper reformulates rotation estimation as a linear model fitting problem, introduces a voting-based method leveraging GPU power, and demonstrates robustness to noise and outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust and efficient solution for rotation estimation, crucial for safety-critical applications in computer vision and robotics.

Method: Reformulates rotation estimation as a linear problem, explores dual structure as a great circle on a quaternion sphere, and proposes a voting-based method optimized for GPU parallel computation.

Result: Achieves exceptional robustness, handling large-scale (10^6) and highly corrupted (99% outliers) problems in under 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: The method is validated through experiments, proving its effectiveness and superiority in solving rotation estimation problems.

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EyeSimVQA is a novel VQA framework using free-energy-based self-repair, combining aesthetic and technical branches for improved performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA systems struggle with spatiotemporal complexity and backbone constraints, limiting enhancement integration.

Method: Dual-branch architecture (aesthetic and technical) with specialized enhancement modules and biologically inspired prediction head.

Result: Competitive or superior performance on five VQA benchmarks, with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA effectively addresses VQA challenges through adaptive repair and biologically grounded design.

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DaMO is a data-efficient Video LLM designed for precise temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding, outperforming prior methods in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning and precise response attribution to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision.

Method: DaMO uses a Temporal-aware Fuseformer with a hierarchical dual-stream architecture for capturing temporal dynamics and fusing visual/audio data. It includes a global residual for efficiency and is trained via a four-stage progressive paradigm.

Result: DaMO surpasses prior methods in temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks, excelling in tasks needing precise temporal alignment.

Conclusion: DaMO advances data-efficient video-language modeling, offering improved temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

*Jiachen Yu,Yufei Zhan,Ziheng Wu,Yousong Zhu,Jinqiao Wang,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline and benchmark (VFaith-Bench) to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning faithfulness by editing visual cues and analyzing performance changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of long CoT in enhancing MLLMs' problem-solving is unclear, especially regarding visual cue extraction and reasoning faithfulness.

Method: Developed a cue-driven editing pipeline (using GPT-Image-1) and VFaith-Bench with 755 entries to test MLLMs' visual reasoning and perception.

Result: Benchmark testing revealed insights into MLLMs' reasoning capabilities and their dependence on visual faithfulness.

Conclusion: The study provides tools and metrics to assess and improve MLLMs' visual reasoning, highlighting the importance of faithfulness in visual information processing.

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WIM systems struggle with lifted axle classification, and few methods exist for detecting them.

Method: Uses YOLOv8s CNN on images captured by perpendicular cameras to detect lifted axles.

Result: Achieved 87% precision, 91.7% recall, and 1.4 ms inference time.

Conclusion: Method is effective for real-time use; improvements possible via larger datasets or image augmentation.

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Motivation: Overlapping features in 3D maps reduce precision; OV-MAP aims to improve instance-level recognition by addressing feature spill-over.

Method: Uses a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D, merges raw and synthetic depth, and employs a 3D mask voting mechanism.

Result: Superior zero-shot performance on datasets like ScanNet200 and Replica, with demonstrated robustness in real-world tests.

Conclusion: OV-MAP is effective for open-world 3D mapping, offering adaptability and robustness without relying on 3D supervised models.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Conclusion: EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating vision-language models and is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured

TL;DR: A$^2$LC is a novel Active Label Correction framework for semantic segmentation that integrates automated correction and an adaptive acquisition function, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with higher efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic segmentation is costly and error-prone. ALC aims to address this, but inefficiencies persist.

Method: A$^2$LC adds an automated correction stage using annotator feedback and introduces an adaptively balanced acquisition function for underrepresented classes.

Result: A$^2$LC outperforms previous methods, achieving higher efficiency (20% budget) and a 27.23% performance improvement on Cityscapes.

Conclusion: A$^2$LC is a highly efficient and effective solution for label correction in semantic segmentation, with promising results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal method for WiFi-based human behavior recognition using phase and DFS data fusion, improving accuracy through dual-branch self-attention and group attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single data types, ignoring feature interaction and fusion, limiting recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes a multimodal approach with dual-branch self-attention for spatial-temporal cues and group attention for feature fusion, optimized via a gating mechanism.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in in-domain and cross-domain experiments on Widar3.0 and XRF55 datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances recognition accuracy by effectively fusing and optimizing multimodal WiFi signal features.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignAligner, a novel method for realistic sign language generation, improves accuracy and expressiveness by co-generating pose modalities, correcting them collaboratively, and synthesizing high-fidelity videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of sign language, involving gestures, expressions, and movements, makes realistic generation challenging.

Method: SignAligner involves three stages: text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and video synthesis.

Result: SignAligner enhances the accuracy and expressiveness of generated sign videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of realistic sign language generation.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fairness evaluation technique for ML in image classification, focusing on skin color as tensor data without rigid categorization, using probability distributions and statistical distance measures. It also proposes a training method to mitigate biases in skin tone categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness in ML, especially for skin color in image classification, which differs from categorical attributes like gender or race, and lacks prior nuanced evaluation methods.

Method: Converts skin color tensor data into probability distributions, applies statistical distance measures, and uses Bayesian regression with polynomial functions for bias mitigation.

Result: Enables fine-grained fairness evaluation within and across groups, improving equitable treatment of skin color in ML models.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more nuanced and equitable method for evaluating and mitigating fairness issues related to skin color in ML.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

### [188] [DISCO: Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning with Conditional Distance Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11653)
*Emre Kavak,Tom Nuno Wolf,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM and DISCO to address models using irrelevant signals (like lighting conditions) in prediction tasks, ensuring focus on causally relevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models often exploit causally irrelevant signals (e.g., lighting) due to selection bias, leading to undesirable predictions. The goal is to enforce focus on causally relevant features.

Method: Proposes SAM, a causal framework for anti-causal settings, and DISCO, a regularization strategy using conditional distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence.

Result: DISCO achieves competitive results in bias mitigation, proving effective as an alternative to kernel-based methods.

Conclusion: SAM and DISCO provide a robust solution to mitigate bias by ensuring models rely on causally relevant signals, improving prediction reliability.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

*Yunhan Ren,Ruihuang Li,Lingbo Liu,Changwen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline for prohibited items in X-ray images, leveraging SAM and a bilayer mask decoder to address appearance gaps and overlapping objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, along with severe overlapping, makes instance segmentation challenging.

Method: Integrates SAM for representation and designs an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder. Uses manually annotated occlusion datasets PIDray-A and PIXray-A.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on occlusion-annotated datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses segmentation challenges in X-ray images, with datasets and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes D-MoLE, a method for evolving MLLM architectures under parameter budgets to address continual multimodal instruction tuning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed architectures struggle with adapting to new tasks due to static capacity, leading to task architecture conflicts and modality imbalance.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts (D-MoLE) with a dynamic layer-wise expert allocator and gradient-based inter-modal continual curriculum.

Result: D-MoLE outperforms baselines by 15%, effectively addressing architecture conflicts and modality imbalance.

Conclusion: First study to explore continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

*Libin Lan,Hongxing Li,Zunhui Xia,Juan Zhou,Xiaofei Zhu,Yongmei Li,Yudong Zhang,Xin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-CGNS, a method for medical visual representation learning, addressing limitations in negative sampling, local detail extraction, and low-level feature retention through cross-modal clustering and masked image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for medical visual representation learning suffer from poor negative sample selection, neglect of fine-grained local details, and ignoring low-level features, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed CM-CGNS method uses cross-modal k-means clustering for negative sampling and a Cross-Modal Masked Image Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module to enhance local and low-level feature learning.

Result: Experiments on five downstream datasets show CM-CGNS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CM-CGNS effectively addresses key limitations, improving medical visual representation learning for diverse recognition tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates airway imaging biomarkers for predicting lung fibrosis survival using a three-stage method: segmentation, feature extraction, and SVM classification, achieving scores of 0.8601 and 0.7346.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the predictive value of airway-related imaging biomarkers for survival outcomes in lung fibrosis patients.

Method: A three-stage approach: 1) nn-Unet for airway segmentation, 2) radiomic feature extraction from trachea and airway regions, 3) SVM classification using these features.

Result: Achieved segmentation score of 0.8601 (Task 1) and classification score of 0.7346 (Task 2).

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for using airway imaging biomarkers in predicting lung fibrosis survival.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on human action recognition using a subset of COCO images found that a binary Vision Transformer (ViT) outperformed other models, achieving 90% accuracy, with explainability tools highlighting its focus on pose-specific regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark and compare the performance of different models (fully connected networks, convolutional networks, CLIP-based models, and transformers) in human action recognition tasks.

Method: Used a three-class subset of the COCO image corpus, tested models ranging from simple fully connected networks to transformer architectures, and employed statistical analysis (ANOVA) and explainability tools (SHAP, LeGrad heatmaps).

Result: The binary ViT achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly outperforming other models (convolutional networks: ~35%, CLIP-based models: ~62-64%). Statistical analysis confirmed these differences (F = 61.37, p < 0.001). Explainability tools showed ViT's focus on pose-specific regions, while simpler models often misclassified due to background textures.

Conclusion: Transformers like ViT are more data-efficient and accurate for human action recognition, and explainability techniques are crucial for diagnosing model errors.

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

TL;DR: MTabVQA is a new benchmark for multi-tabular visual question answering, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on multi-hop reasoning across table images. Fine-tuning VLMs with MTabVQA-Instruct improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the ability to assess VLMs' performance on multi-tabular visual data, a common real-world scenario.

Method: Introduces MTabVQA, a benchmark with 3,745 complex QA pairs requiring multi-hop reasoning across table images, and MTabVQA-Instruct for fine-tuning VLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show limitations on MTabVQA, but fine-tuning with MTabVQA-Instruct significantly improves performance.

Conclusion: MTabVQA fills a critical gap in evaluating VLMs for multi-tabular reasoning, and fine-tuning enhances their capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMAF-Net addresses modality imbalance in incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation with dynamic fusion, distillation frameworks, and adaptive training monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in real-world scenarios due to idealized assumptions and neglect of modality relationships.

Method: DMAF-Net uses dynamic fusion, relation and prototype distillation, and adaptive training monitoring.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 datasets.

Conclusion: DMAF-Net effectively balances modality contributions and improves segmentation performance.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and
MyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete

Method: The study tests LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three tasks and introduces a DCI connector for comparison.

Result: The standard model performs best overall, especially in vision-heavy tasks, while the DCI version excels in semantic coherence tasks.

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with plug-and-play techniques like DCI shows promise for Interleave tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based
Understanding and Interactive Multi-Modal Communication. Secondly, we add the
Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and
compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and
SlideVQA. Our results highlight the potential of combining powerful foundation
models with plug-and-play techniques for Interleave tasks. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Sentinel-2 imagery resolution uniformly across all spectral bands, addressing limitations of current super-resolution and pansharpening methods.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) diffusion-based SR trained on harmonized RGB data, (2) fusion network using super-resolved RGB as a spatial prior. Includes degradation model and encoder for blind SR.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines in fidelity, spectral consistency, and spatial alignment. Fusion network surpasses classical pansharpening for 20m/60m bands.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion for modular Sentinel-2 SR. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study

TL;DR: MambaVSR introduces a state-space model for video super-resolution, addressing non-local dependencies and computational efficiency with innovative modules like SCC and CAS, outperforming Transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods struggle with large motion displacements and long sequences due to reliance on optical flow or transformers.

Method: MambaVSR uses Shared Compass Construction (SCC) for intra-frame connectivity and Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS) for aligning non-local content, combined with Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) for detail recovery.

Result: MambaVSR achieves 0.58 dB higher PSNR than Transformer-based methods on REDS dataset with 55% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MambaVSR is a superior, efficient framework for VSR, effectively handling non-local dependencies and computational challenges.

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION combines discriminative (CLIP) and generative (diffusion) models for anomaly detection, excelling in capturing global and local features, outperforming baselines on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is challenging due to ambiguous definitions, diverse anomaly types, and scarce training data, requiring a model that captures both low-level and high-level features.

Method: CLIPFUSION integrates CLIP for global features and diffusion models for local details, using cross-attention and feature maps for anomaly detection.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets in anomaly segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: CLIPFUSION demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion for scalable anomaly detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: AgentSense introduces a virtual data generation pipeline using LLMs to create diverse personas and simulate home activities, improving HAR system performance with limited real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, diverse labeled datasets for HAR systems due to variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user behavior.

Method: AgentSense leverages LLMs to generate personas, create routines, decompose actions, and simulate activities in VirtualHome with virtual sensors.

Result: Virtual data improves HAR performance, especially with limited real data, achieving comparable results to full real datasets.

Conclusion: AgentSense demonstrates the potential of virtual data to overcome the challenge of scarce annotated datasets in ambient sensing.

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

*Divyanshu Mishra,Mohammadreza Salehi,Pramit Saha,Olga Patey,Aris T. Papageorghiou,Yuki M. Asano,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISCOVR is a self-supervised dual-branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning, combining temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial semantics to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in echocardiography (e.g., subtle structures, low PSNR) limit existing SSL methods, necessitating domain-specific solutions.

Method: DISCOVR integrates a clustering-based video encoder for temporal dynamics and an online image encoder for spatial semantics, linked via semantic cluster distillation.

Result: Outperforms video-SSL baselines and specialized methods in zero-shot, linear probing, and segmentation tasks across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DISCOVR advances SSL for echocardiography by combining temporal and spatial learning, demonstrating superior performance and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

### [204] [GPLQ: A General, Practical, and Lightning QAT Method for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11784)
*Guang Liang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ is a novel framework for efficient ViT quantization, addressing limitations of PTQ and QAT with a two-stage approach, achieving competitive accuracy and generalization while being 100x faster than QAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ and QAT methods for ViT quantization have significant drawbacks, such as accuracy drops, high computational costs, and poor generalization. GPLQ aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: GPLQ uses a two-stage strategy: Stage 1 quantizes activations while keeping weights in FP32, and Stage 2 quantizes weights using PTQ. This preserves the model's optimization 'basin' and ensures generalization.

Result: GPLQ is 100x faster than QAT, reduces memory usage below FP32 levels, and achieves 4-bit model performance competitive with FP32 models on ImageNet and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: GPLQ provides a practical, efficient, and general solution for ViT quantization, with plans to release an open-source toolkit for broader use.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores object detection in point cloud data for Teleoperated Driving (TD), using the SELMA dataset and analyzing compression algorithms and object detectors for efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of interconnected devices and V2X communications has enhanced TD, but detecting cars and pedestrians safely remains a challenge.

Method: The study uses the SELMA dataset, augmented with ground-truth bounding boxes, to evaluate compression algorithms and object detectors under various metrics.

Result: Performance of compression and detection methods is analyzed, including their impact on V2X network metrics like data rate and latency.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to improving safe TD operations by optimizing object detection and compression for V2X networks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on Vision-Language Translation (VLT) evaluates data quality, model architecture, and metrics, introducing a new dataset (AibTrans), benchmarking models, and proposing a robust evaluation method (DA Score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess and improve the performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on VLT, addressing gaps in dataset quality, model evaluation, and cross-lingual adaptation.

Method: (1) Introduces AibTrans, a multilingual dataset with OCR-corrected annotations. (2) Benchmarks 17 models (11 commercial, 6 open-source) across architectures. (3) Proposes Density-Aware Evaluation (DA Score) for reliable translation quality measurement.

Result: Reveals OCR dependency in models, contrasts generation vs. reasoning behaviors, and shows fine-tuning on high-resource languages degrades cross-lingual performance. Proposes a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy.

Conclusion: Establishes a new VLT benchmark, highlights dataset and metric improvements, and offers a strategy to adapt LVLMs effectively without losing generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

TL;DR: A cost-effective 3D object detection pipeline using cameras instead of LiDAR, leveraging 2D CNNs for efficient processing, achieving competitive results with faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cheaper alternative to LiDAR-based 3D object detection by utilizing existing cameras and improving computational efficiency.

Method: Lifts 2D vision-based algorithm results to 3D using cameras, processes point clouds with 2D CNNs for efficiency, and focuses on all road users.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art image-based methods on KITTI benchmark with significantly faster runtime (one-third).

Conclusion: Demonstrates a viable, cost-effective alternative to LiDAR for 3D object detection in autonomous driving, with efficient computation and broad applicability.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

TL;DR: SphereDrag is a novel framework for panoramic image editing, addressing challenges like boundary discontinuity and uneven pixel density using spherical geometry. It outperforms existing methods by 10.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image editing is underexplored due to challenges like boundary discontinuity and projection distortions.

Method: SphereDrag uses adaptive reprojection (AR), great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA), and spherical search region tracking (SSRT) for accurate editing.

Result: SphereDrag achieves a 10.5% improvement in geometric consistency and image quality.

Conclusion: SphereDrag effectively tackles panoramic editing challenges and sets a new benchmark with PanoBench.

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O2Former, an instance segmentation framework for SAR ship imagery, improves performance with multi-scale feature interaction and orientation-aware modules, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR ship images pose challenges like scale variation and fuzzy boundaries, often overlooked by current methods, necessitating a tailored solution.

Method: O2Former extends Mask2Former with an Optimized Query Generator (OQG) for multi-scale feature interaction and an Orientation-Aware Embedding Module (OAEM) for directional sensitivity.

Result: O2Former outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in SAR ship instance segmentation, demonstrating superior feature alignment and detail capture.

Conclusion: O2Former effectively addresses SAR-specific challenges, offering improved performance and generalization for ship instance segmentation.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for aligned novel view image and geometry generation using warping-and-inpainting, leveraging cross-modal attention distillation for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior methods requiring dense posed images or pose-embedded models, enabling robust novel-view synthesis and geometry prediction.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf geometry predictors for partial geometries, formulates synthesis as inpainting, and employs cross-modal attention distillation for alignment. Proximity-based mesh conditioning integrates depth and normal cues.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis, competitive reconstruction quality, and geometrically aligned colored point clouds.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines image and geometry synthesis, outperforming prior approaches in accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

TL;DR: A smartphone-based deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm was compared to a commercial infrared eye tracker (Tobii Pro Nano), showing comparable accuracy but higher sensitivity to factors like lighting, vision correction, and age.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of appearance-based gaze estimation in realistic mobile conditions, addressing key sensitivity factors.

Method: A lightweight CNN (MobileNet-V3) with LSTM predicted gaze from grayscale facial images. Data from 51 participants was collected using dynamic stimuli, with accuracy measured via Euclidean distance.

Result: The deep-learning model had a mean error of 17.76 mm vs. 16.53 mm for Tobii Pro Nano, with higher sensitivity to lighting, vision correction, and age.

Conclusion: Appearance-based methods show promise for mobile eye tracking, though performance varies with usage conditions, providing a framework for future evaluations.

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

*Constantin Venhoff,Ashkan Khakzar,Sonia Joseph,Philip Torr,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for aligning visual and linguistic representations in vision-language models (VLMs) using a frozen LLM and ViT, connected by a linear adapter, and analyzes the alignment process using pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs align visual and linguistic representations, given the lack of clarity in current mechanisms.

Method: Uses a frozen LLM and ViT with a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning, and employs SAEs to analyze alignment.

Result: Visual representations align with language features in middle-to-later layers, revealing misalignment in early layers.

Conclusion: Current adapter-based architectures may not optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning, prompting further investigation.

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

TL;DR: A lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework improves radiology report generation by integrating medical priors and dynamically adjusting inference depth, outperforming baselines without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning performance of vision-language models (VLLMs) for radiology report generation without additional training.

Method: Introduces TGT framework with structured medical priors and a reasoning budget forcing strategy to dynamically extend inference depth.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods, generates more accurate reports, and reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling with TGT effectively improves VLLM performance in radiology, offering a simple, training-free solution.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

*Jiacong Wang,Zijiang Kang,Haochen Wang,Haiyong Jiang,Jiawen Li,Bohong Wu,Ya Wang,Jiao Ran,Xiao Liang,Chao Feng,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGR is a multimodal reasoning model that enhances visual perception for complex tasks, outperforming baselines with fewer image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT reasoning methods are language-biased and limited to specific domains, lacking visual detail comprehension.

Method: VGR detects relevant image regions and integrates them into reasoning via a replay stage, using a custom SFT dataset.

Result: VGR improves scores on benchmarks (e.g., +12.9 on ChartQA) while using 30% fewer image tokens.

Conclusion: VGR advances multimodal reasoning by combining visual grounding with language deduction, excelling in detail-rich tasks.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if CT-derived body composition metrics, alone or combined with clinical variables, can predict postoperative outcomes like mortality and complications.

Method: Used Cox proportional hazards model for 1-year mortality (C-index, IBS) and logistic regression for secondary outcomes (AUC, Brier Score). Over 300 CT features were analyzed.

Result: Predictive performance was evaluated for mortality and complications, with associations described by odds ratios.

Conclusion: CT-derived body composition metrics show potential for predicting postoperative outcomes, possibly enhancing existing risk predictors.

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

TL;DR: Affogato is a large-scale benchmark for affordance grounding, addressing challenges like fine-grained localization and ambiguity, with 150K annotated instances and open-vocabulary text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of affordance grounding is critical for intelligent agents but remains challenging due to fine-grained localization needs, ambiguity, and dataset scarcity.

Method: Developed vision-language models using pretrained part-aware vision backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder, trained on the Affogato dataset.

Result: Models achieved promising performance on 2D and 3D benchmarks and showed effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The Affogato dataset and models provide a robust solution for affordance grounding, with public availability for further research.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

*Yanyan Wang,Yingying Wang,Junli Liang,Yin Xu,Yunlong Liu,Yiming Xu,Zhengwang Jiang,Zhehe Li,Fei Li,Long Zhao,Kuang Xu,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleEval-OS, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling, covering 15 datasets and 13 subtasks. It categorizes LLM capabilities into four levels and evaluates 14 models, showing open-source LLMs can outperform closed-source ones in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and lack of benchmarks for LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling hinder their potential exploration in this critical field.

Method: Proposes TeleEval-OS, a benchmark with 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, simulating four operational stages. Evaluates 10 open-source and 4 closed-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot methods.

Result: Open-source LLMs outperform closed-source ones in specific scenarios, demonstrating their potential in telecommunications operation scheduling.

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS fills a research gap and highlights the value of open-source LLMs in specialized domains like telecommunications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates position bias in multimodal RAG systems, revealing a U-shaped accuracy curve and introducing metrics to quantify and visualize this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG models are sensitive to evidence order, leading to unstable performance and biased reasoning, especially with increasing retrieval complexity and modality diversity.

Method: Controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, introducing the Position Sensitivity Index (PSI_p) and a visualization framework for attention patterns.

Result: Multimodal interactions intensify position bias, which increases logarithmically with retrieval range, showing a U-shaped accuracy curve.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for position-aware strategies like evidence reordering or debiasing to improve RAG system reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

TL;DR: Analysis of Russenorsk lexicon using LLMs, creating a structured dictionary and testing hypotheses against academic literature, with a translation agent for modern texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unique linguistic features of Russenorsk and validate LLM-generated hypotheses against existing academic theories.

Method: Construct a structured dictionary from literary sources, analyze word formation and grammar, and develop a translation agent for modern texts.

Result: Hypotheses from LLMs align with some academic theories, and a functional translation agent is created.

Conclusion: LLMs can aid in reconstructing and analyzing pidgin languages like Russenorsk, offering insights into their structure and usage.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

Motivation: To reduce the burden of ROS documentation in healthcare by automating extraction using scalable and locally deployable LLMs.

Method: Pipeline uses SecTag for ROS section extraction and few-shot LLMs for identifying entity spans, status, and body systems. Evaluated on 36 notes with 341 annotated entities.

Result: ChatGPT achieved lowest error rates (28.2% spans, 14.5% status/systems). Open-source LLMs showed comparable performance (30.5-36.7% spans, 24.3-27.3% status/systems).

Conclusion: The pipeline is scalable and locally deployable, with open-source LLMs as viable alternatives to commercial models in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited

### [222] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a bias (Deontological Keyword Bias) where modal expressions like 'must' or 'ought to' make them judge non-obligatory scenarios as obligations. A mitigation strategy using few-shot examples and reasoning prompts is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs handle judgments about obligations, especially under the influence of modal expressions, an underexplored area in alignment studies.

Method: Analyzed LLM responses to commonsense scenarios with modal expressions, proposing a mitigation strategy combining few-shot examples and reasoning prompts.

Result: LLMs judged over 90% of non-obligatory scenarios as obligations when modal expressions were present, showing consistency across models and formats.

Conclusion: Modal expressions bias LLM judgments, highlighting the need for mitigation strategies to align their normative decisions with human expectations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A proposed interface bridges the gap between designers' natural language and modeling languages, enhancing Large Language Models' ability to control prototype models effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial designers need intuitive ways to control prototype models using natural language, avoiding complex commands. Current Large Language Models underutilize this potential due to language gaps.

Method: An interface architecture is developed, grounded in design principles from fast prototyping practices, with an algorithm for automated domain specification.

Result: Machine evaluations and human studies show the interface enables precise and effective control of prototype models.

Conclusion: The interface serves as an auxiliary module for Large Language Models, bridging language gaps for better prototype control.

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM is a near training-free method to reduce multilingual object hallucination in LVLMs by aligning cross-lingual attention patterns, achieving significant improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit higher object hallucination in non-English languages compared to English, and existing solutions are resource-intensive.

Method: CLAIM identifies language-specific attention heads, estimates language shift vectors, and intervenes in attention outputs during inference.

Result: CLAIM improves performance by 13.56% on POPE and 21.75% on MME benchmarks, with up to 30% improvement in Spanish.

Conclusion: Multilingual attention divergence is most critical in intermediate layers, and CLAIM effectively mitigates hallucination without extensive training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyclicReflex, a method to optimize reflection token usage in large reasoning models (LRMs) for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive or insufficient use of reflection tokens (over-reflection or under-reflection) degrades LRM performance, prompting the need for adaptive regulation.

Method: Proposes cyclical reflection token scheduling (CyclicReflex), dynamically modulating reflection token logits with a position-dependent triangular waveform.

Result: CyclicReflex improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B) on benchmarks like MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023, outperforming standard decoding and recent approaches.

Conclusion: CyclicReflex effectively manages reflection token allocation, enhancing LRM performance by balancing their usage.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND is a framework for Fake News Detection (FND) that uses LLMs and experiential learning to improve evidence-based verification, addressing noise, generalization, and bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FND methods struggle with noisy evidence, poor generalization, and unclear decision-making. LLMs introduce new challenges like hallucinated rationales and bias.

Method: RoE-FND combines LLMs with experiential learning in two stages: self-reflective knowledge building (curating a knowledge base from past errors) and dynamic criterion retrieval (synthesizing reasoning guidelines from historical cases).

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization and effectiveness across three datasets.

Conclusion: RoE-FND offers a robust, adaptable, and training-free solution for FND, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether MLLMs can surpass human performance in multimodal tasks and identify gaps in their capabilities.

Method: Developed MANBench with 1,314 questions across nine tasks, comparing human and MLLM performance through experiments.

Result: MLLMs excel in knowledge-based tasks but struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning and complex tasks like puzzles.

Conclusion: MANBench shows MLLMs still lag behind humans in many domains, urging further research to bridge this gap.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a method using LLMs to generate valid and general CCFGs from natural language specifications with limited supervision, outperforming 17 LLMs in grammar quality and test effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating valid and general grammars from natural language specifications is challenging, especially with limited supervision. CCFGs help represent such specifications, but inducing them effectively remains a problem.

Method: The approach fine-tunes an open-source LLM for specification-to-grammar translation and uses GRPO for reinforcement learning to enhance grammar validity and generality. Iterative feedback is also examined for error correction.

Result: SAGE outperforms 17 LLMs, improving grammar validity by 15.92%p and test effectiveness by 12.34%p over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates high-quality grammars from natural language specifications, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing LLMs.

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our

TL;DR: PRISM is a transformer-based model for sequential clinical decision-making, predicting next steps in patient diagnostics using tokenized event sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical decision-making by modeling sequential diagnostic processes, moving beyond isolated classification.

Method: Uses a transformer architecture with a custom clinical vocabulary and autoregressive training to predict next events in patient timelines.

Result: Outperforms random baselines in next-token prediction, generating realistic diagnostic pathways and clinician behaviors.

Conclusion: PRISM shows promise for clinical decision support and education, bridging ML and real-world diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

TL;DR: RedDebate is a multi-agent debate framework using adversarial argumentation among LLMs to identify and mitigate unsafe behaviors, reducing them by up to 23.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety methods rely on costly human evaluations or single-model assessments, which are hard to scale and prone to oversight.

Method: RedDebate employs collaborative disagreement among multiple LLMs, automated red-teaming, and integrates long-term memory to retain safety insights.

Result: Debate alone reduces unsafe behaviors by 17.7%; with long-term memory, reductions exceed 23.5%.

Conclusion: RedDebate is the first fully automated framework combining multi-agent debates and red-teaming to enhance AI safety without human intervention.

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

TL;DR: SPACE is a unified framework that jointly mitigates factuality and faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs by editing shared activation subspaces, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from factuality and faithfulness hallucinations, and current methods addressing these independently create performance trade-offs.

Method: SPACE uses dual-task feature modeling to identify shared activation subspaces and edits them via spectral clustering and attention head saliency scoring.

Result: Experiments show SPACE outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPACE provides a unified solution for mitigating hallucinations in LLMs by leveraging shared neural subspaces.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach using LLMs for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR systems improves rare named entity recognition by 21% over self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with rare named entities and domain mismatches, while LLMs excel across domains. This work aims to bridge the gap.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with an LLM as a reward model to score ASR hypotheses, fine-tuning the ASR model using these scores.

Result: Achieves a 21% improvement in entity word error rate compared to conventional self-training methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances ASR performance for rare named entities by leveraging LLMs and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

*Jubin Abhishek Soni,Amit Anand,Rajesh Kumar Pandey,Aniket Abhishek Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCT extends RAG for dynamic domains with multi-turn dialogue and evolving tools, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are static and single-turn, making them unsuitable for dynamic domains like healthcare and smart homes.

Method: DCT uses an attention-based context cache, LoRA-based retrieval, and context compression to adapt without retraining.

Result: DCT improves plan accuracy by 14%, reduces hallucinations by 37%, and matches GPT-4 performance at lower cost.

Conclusion: DCT enables scalable, adaptable AI assistants for dynamic environments, even with unseen tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

*Songyang Liu,Chaozhuo Li,Jiameng Qiu,Xi Zhang,Feiran Huang,Litian Zhang,Yiming Hei,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews advancements in LLM safety evaluation, covering motivations, tasks, metrics, methods, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid deployment of LLMs has raised safety concerns (e.g., toxicity, bias), necessitating a systematic review of evaluation efforts.

Method: The survey categorizes safety evaluation into four aspects: 'Why evaluate,' 'What to evaluate,' 'Where to evaluate,' and 'How to evaluate.'

Result: It summarizes key safety dimensions (toxicity, robustness, ethics, etc.), metrics, datasets, and evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The paper highlights challenges in LLM safety evaluation and proposes future research directions to ensure safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

*Manuel D. S. Hopp,Vincent Labatut,Arthur Amalvy,Richard Dufour,Hannah Stone,Hayley Jach,Kou Murayama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to model reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps in text, using BERTopic and persistent homology, and validates it with empirical data from 'The Hunger Games'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reader curiosity is key for engagement but underexplored in NLP. The study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging Information Gap Theory.

Method: The approach uses BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze a dynamic semantic network's topology (connected components, cycles, voids) as proxies for information gaps.

Result: The pipeline significantly improves curiosity prediction (73% vs. 30% explained deviance) compared to a baseline, using topological features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel computational method to analyze text structure and its impact on reader engagement.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

### [236] [C-SEO Bench: Does Conversational SEO Work?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11097)
*Haritz Puerto,Martin Gubri,Tommaso Green,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-SEO Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO) methods across tasks, domains, and actor adoption rates, revealing current methods' ineffectiveness and the superiority of traditional SEO strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from SEO to C-SEO due to LLMs lacks comprehensive evaluation across domains and competitive scenarios, prompting the need for a robust benchmark.

Method: C-SEO Bench evaluates C-SEO methods using two search tasks (question answering, product recommendation) across three domains, with varying actor adoption rates.

Result: Current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective; traditional SEO strategies outperform them. Gains diminish as more actors adopt C-SEO, indicating a zero-sum problem.

Conclusion: C-SEO Bench highlights the limitations of current C-SEO methods and underscores the effectiveness of traditional SEO in LLM-driven search environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to differentiate AI agents from LLM chatbots and categorizes evaluation benchmarks for AI agents, offering guidance for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks confuse LLM chatbots and AI agents, creating challenges for researchers in selecting benchmarks.

Method: The paper provides a systematic analysis and analytical framework differentiating AI agents from LLM chatbots along five key aspects, categorizes benchmarks, and outlines evaluation methodologies.

Result: A detailed framework and practical reference tables are presented, along with synthesized trends and future methodologies.

Conclusion: The findings guide researchers in selecting and applying benchmarks, advancing AI agent evaluation.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

### [238] [You Only Fine-tune Once: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-Tuning for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11103)
*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL), a method that improves in-context learning (ICL) by using many-shot examples as training targets, narrowing the performance gap with dedicated fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot ICL methods lag behind dedicated fine-tuning. The authors aim to enhance ICL performance by leveraging many-shot examples more effectively.

Method: Proposes ManyICL, treating every answer in the context as a supervised training target, shifting many-shot examples from prompts to learning targets.

Result: ManyICL outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning, approaches dedicated fine-tuning performance, and reduces catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: ManyICL is a promising approach for improving ICL efficiency and performance, bridging the gap with dedicated fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

*Hanzhi Zhang,Heng Fan,Kewei Sha,Yan Huang,Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dynamic sparse attention mechanism (DAM) is introduced to improve efficiency and adaptability in long-context NLP tasks, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with efficiency in long-context tasks due to quadratic self-attention complexity, and existing sparse methods fail to capture dynamic attention patterns.

Method: DAM dynamically assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving heterogeneous patterns without predefined structures or fine-tuning.

Result: DAM achieves high alignment with full-attention models, reducing memory and compute costs while maintaining retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: DAM offers a scalable solution for deploying large-scale LLMs efficiently, without compromising performance.

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel medical assistant system optimizes LLMs for edge devices using neuron saliency-based pruning and quantization, achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are too large for real-time, resource-constrained healthcare environments like edge devices, necessitating compression.

Method: Neuron saliency-based pruning and post-training quantization are used to compress LLMs, evaluated on medical benchmarks.

Result: 50% compressed Gemma and 67% compressed LLaMA3 models achieve real-time inference on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5.

Conclusion: The framework successfully compresses LLMs for specialized domains, enabling efficient deployment in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

*Ningyuan Li,Junrui Liu,Yi Shan,Minghui Huang,Tong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG improves RAG by addressing entity-level extraction flaws with hierarchical query-resolution and dependency-aware reranking, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods rely on entity extraction, risking misinterpretation and poor retrieval, leading to irrelevant or contradictory results.

Method: PankRAG uses hierarchical query-resolution and dependency-aware reranking to structure reasoning and validate retrieval.

Result: PankRAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, showing robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: PankRAG enhances RAG by capturing latent information and dependencies, improving retrieval and response fidelity.

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-turn dialogue and chain-of-thought reasoning by leveraging attention mechanisms and self-supervised learning.

Method: Implemented on vLLM runtime, capturing per-layer, per-head cross-attention weights asynchronously and generalizing the reward function for conversation histories.

Result: Proposed an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent attention collapse and outlined future directions.

Conclusion: The extension shows promise for multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning, with practical trade-offs addressed.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

*Yile Chen,Yicheng Tao,Yue Jiang,Shuai Liu,Han Yu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QT-Mob enhances LLMs for mobility analytics by introducing semantic location tokens and complementary fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based mobility analytics methods lack semantic location representation and robust mobility signal modeling.

Method: QT-Mob uses a location tokenization module for semantic tokens and complementary fine-tuning to align with LLMs.

Result: Outperforms deep learning and LLM-based methods in next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks.

Conclusion: QT-Mob improves LLMs' mobility data interpretation and generalizability for analytics tasks.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench evaluates LLMs' consistency in truth evaluation when faced with directional framing of facts, aiming to measure their ability to resist user influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how directional framing affects LLMs' agreement with factually true statements, a common user scenario.

Method: Sampling evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, constructing framing prompts (correct/incorrect claims), and recording model agreement and reasoning.

Result: The benchmark isolates framing-induced variability by stratifying results based on model accuracy in neutral presentations.

Conclusion: AssertBench measures LLMs' ability to maintain consistent truth evaluation despite contradictory user assertions.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

TL;DR: A survey on the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, evaluation methods, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for robust LLMs in diverse applications by providing a comprehensive review of concepts, methods, and challenges.

Method: Organizes the survey into three perspectives: adversarial robustness, OOD robustness, and evaluation methods, reviewing representative works in each.

Result: Summarizes key findings and tools, offering a GitHub repository for community access to related works.

Conclusion: Highlights future opportunities and research directions, emphasizing the importance of robust LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Motivation: The increasing volume of academic submissions burdens reviewers, and LLMs could assist but are prone to adversarial attacks, raising reliability concerns.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs' review generation effectiveness, adversarial attack impact, and mitigation strategies through comprehensive analysis.

Result: LLMs show significant vulnerabilities to adversarial text manipulations, distorting their assessments.

Conclusion: Addressing adversarial risks is crucial for LLMs to enhance, not undermine, scholarly communication integrity.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

Method: KokushiMD-10 includes 11,588 real exam questions from ten Japanese healthcare licensing exams, featuring clinical images and expert rationales to assess textual and visual reasoning.

Result: Over 30 LLMs were tested, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, but none consistently passed across all domains, revealing gaps in medical AI performance.

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10 addresses critical gaps in medical AI evaluation, offering a comprehensive, multilingual, and multimodal benchmark for advancing reasoning-centric AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

*Yerim Oh,Jun-Hyung Park,Junho Kim,SungHo Kim,SangKeun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATTER, a novel tokenization method for materials science, integrates domain knowledge to reduce fragmentation and semantic loss, outperforming existing methods by 4% in generation and 2% in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods, designed for natural language, fragment and lose semantic integrity in materials science texts.

Method: MATTER combines MatDetector (trained on a materials knowledge base) and a re-ranking method to prioritize material concepts during token merging.

Result: MATTER achieves 4% and 2% performance gains in generation and classification tasks, respectively.

Conclusion: Domain-specific tokenization, like MATTER, is crucial for maintaining structural and semantic integrity in scientific text processing.

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct is a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance LLMs' foundational and chat capabilities, outperforming proprietary models like GPT-4 in some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source instruction datasets are narrow in scope, limiting generalization and widening the gap with proprietary models.

Method: A two-phase pipeline: Phase 1 curates 7.4M foundational instructions; Phase 2 synthesizes 1.5M chat instructions through selection, evolution, and filtering.

Result: Fine-tuned models (e.g., InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B) outperform GPT-4-0314 by 8.6% in instruction following tasks with comparable foundational performance.

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct bridges the gap with proprietary models, demonstrating the synergy between foundational and chat training for holistic LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

*Junyong Lin,Lu Dai,Ruiqian Han,Yijie Sui,Ruilin Wang,Xingliang Sun,Qinglin Wu,Min Feng,Hao Liu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScIRGen is a framework for generating scientific QA & retrieval datasets that better reflect real-world research needs, creating a 61k QA dataset (ScIRGen-Geo) with realistic queries and improved methods for question generation and answer filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific QA datasets lack alignment with real-world research inquiries, necessitating a more accurate representation of professional researchers' information needs.

Method: Developed ScIRGen framework with dataset-oriented information extraction, cognitive taxonomy-based question generation, and LLM perplexity shift-based answer filtering.

Result: Created ScIRGen-Geo, a 61k QA dataset, and benchmarked methods, revealing limitations in handling complex questions.

Conclusion: ScIRGen advances tools for scientific information needs, though current methods still struggle with complex reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

### [252] [Benchmarking Foundation Speech and Language Models for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11119)
*Jingyu Li,Lingchao Mao,Hairong Wang,Zhendong Wang,Xi Mao,Xuelei Sherry Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks foundation models for early ADRD detection using speech and language features, finding ASR-derived embeddings most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of ADRD is crucial for intervention, and speech markers offer non-invasive biomarkers.

Method: Used the PREPARE Challenge dataset to benchmark speech and language models for classifying cognitive status (HC, MCI, AD).

Result: Whisper-medium (speech) and BERT with pause annotation (language) performed best. ASR-derived embeddings were most effective.

Conclusion: Foundation models, especially ASR-based, show promise for scalable, non-invasive ADRD detection.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

### [253] [SDMPrune: Self-Distillation MLP Pruning for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11120)
*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for compressing LLMs using self-distillation loss during pruning, focusing on MLP modules to reduce costs without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High deployment costs of LLMs and the inefficiency of gradient-based pruning methods that ignore generative capability.

Method: Introduces self-distillation loss during pruning to leverage original model predictions and focuses on pruning MLP modules.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning methods on zero-shot benchmarks and achieves competitive performance among 1B-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compresses LLMs while maintaining performance, with code and weights made publicly available.

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

*Wei-Ping Huang,Guan-Ting Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUTA-LM combines TTA with language model rescoring to address domain mismatches in ASR, achieving robust performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate performance drops in ASR due to domain mismatches by effectively combining TTA and language model rescoring.

Method: Proposes SUTA-LM, an extension of SUTA, using controlled adaptation guided by acoustic and linguistic information, followed by language model rescoring.

Result: Achieves robust performance across 18 diverse ASR datasets.

Conclusion: SUTA-LM effectively addresses the challenge of combining TTA and language model rescoring, demonstrating strong adaptability across domains.

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

*Freddie Grabovski,Gilad Gressel,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASRJam and EchoGuard are introduced to disrupt vishing scams by targeting ASR vulnerabilities with adversarial audio, ensuring human callers remain unaffected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLM-powered vishing scams using ASR and TTS poses a security threat, necessitating proactive defenses.

Method: ASRJam injects adversarial perturbations into audio; EchoGuard uses natural distortions like echo to disrupt ASR while preserving human comprehension.

Result: EchoGuard outperformed state-of-the-art attacks in a 39-person study, balancing ASR disruption and human usability.

Conclusion: EchoGuard is an effective, practical defense against vishing scams, disrupting ASR without harming human communication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUIRoboTron-Speech is an end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that uses speech instructions and screenshots for action prediction, addressing limitations of text-based GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based GUI agents limit accessibility and convenience, especially in hands-free scenarios. Speech instructions offer a more natural alternative.

Method: Leveraged TTS to convert text instructions to speech, trained the agent via progressive grounding and planning, and used a heuristic mixed-instruction strategy to address modality imbalance.

Result: GUIRoboTron-Speech outperforms benchmarks, proving speech's effectiveness as an instruction modality for GUI agents.

Conclusion: Speech-based GUI agents like GUIRoboTron-Speech show significant potential for widespread use, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

*Andrew Keenan Richardson,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Sean Moss,Vincent Wang-Mascianica,Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models' reasoning errors increasingly mirror human fallacies as they improve, challenging the idea that scaling leads to normative rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns, including predictable fallacies, as they advance.

Method: Applied the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) using PyETR to evaluate 38 language models on 383 reasoning tasks where humans predictably err.

Result: Advanced models showed increased alignment of incorrect answers with human fallacies (ρ = 0.360, p = 0.0265), independent of error rate.

Conclusion: Scaling models doesn't ensure normative rationality; instead, they increasingly reflect human-like biases and limitations.

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

TL;DR: CHECK, a continuous-learning framework, reduces LLM hallucinations in healthcare by integrating clinical databases and an information-theory-based classifier, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) hinder their clinical use, necessitating a reliable solution for safe deployment in healthcare.

Method: CHECK combines structured clinical databases with a classifier grounded in information theory to detect factual and reasoning-based hallucinations.

Result: CHECK reduced hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% in LLama3.3-70B-Instruct, achieved AUCs of 0.95-0.96 on medical benchmarks, and boosted GPT-4o's USMLE passing rate to 92.1%.

Conclusion: CHECK provides a scalable solution for safe LLM deployment in high-stakes domains by suppressing hallucinations below clinical error thresholds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-refining framework improves ASR performance using unlabeled data, generating pseudo-labels to train a TTS system, then bootstrapping synthetic data back into ASR. Demonstrated on Taiwanese Mandarin, it reduces error rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings without relying on labeled datasets.

Method: Uses unlabeled speech to generate pseudo-labels, trains a TTS system, and bootstraps synthetic data into ASR for self-improvement.

Result: Twister, the adapted model, reduces error rates by 20% on Mandarin and 50% on code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper.

Conclusion: The framework is a practical alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation, effective for low-resource ASR improvement.

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

*David C. Krakauer,John W. Krakauer,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergence in complex systems and applies it to Large Language Models (LLMs), questioning if they exhibit emergent intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emergent properties manifest in complex systems like LLMs and whether these models display emergent intelligence.

Method: Examines claims of emergent capabilities in LLMs, reviews quantification methods for emergence, and evaluates if LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Result: The paper likely presents evidence or arguments about the presence (or absence) of emergent capabilities and intelligence in LLMs.

Conclusion: The study concludes by addressing whether LLMs demonstrate emergent intelligence, contributing to the broader discourse on complexity and AI.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for extracting and classifying medication discontinuations in EHR notes, finding GPT-4o and open-source models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct perform well, with few-shot learning improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication discontinuation data in EHRs is often buried in unstructured notes, posing patient safety risks. Automating extraction and classification can improve scalability and accuracy.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on three EHR datasets, testing medication extraction, status classification, and joint tasks. Compared zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting strategies.

Result: GPT-4o achieved the highest F1 scores (94.0% extraction, 78.1% classification, 72.7% joint task). Open-source models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct also performed well. Few-shot learning improved results.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for EHR medication tasks, with open-source models offering scalable alternatives. Few-shot learning enhances performance, while medical-specific LLMs lag behind general-domain ones.

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small models (<1B parameters) remain competitive in BEA 2025 shared task despite limited computational resources, with performance gaps of 6.46-13.13 points compared to winners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that smaller models can perform competitively under resource constraints, reflecting conditions in the Global South.

Method: Used models with fewer than 1B parameters, designed for low-budget or no-GPU setups.

Result: Performance gaps ranged from 6.46 to 13.13 points across tracks, showing competitiveness.

Conclusion: Small models are viable for such tasks, even with limited computational power.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a

### [263] [Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11244)
*Shun Shao,Yftah Ziser,Zheng Zhao,Yifu Qiu,Shay B. Cohen,Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMSAE is a multilingual debiasing method that outperforms monolingual and cross-lingual approaches by identifying and mitigating joint bias subspaces across languages using iterative SVD-based truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods are limited to individual languages, missing the opportunity to leverage multilingual representations for cross-lingual bias mitigation.

Method: IMSAE uses iterative SVD-based truncation to identify and mitigate joint bias subspaces across multiple languages.

Result: IMSAE is effective across eight languages and five demographic dimensions, even in zero-shot settings, and outperforms traditional approaches while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: IMSAE provides a robust solution for multilingual debiasing, leveraging linguistic similarities to transfer debiasing effects across languages.

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

*Kushagra Dixit,Abhishek Rajgaria,Harshavardhan Kalalbandi,Dan Roth,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores prompting techniques for temporal table reasoning in LLMs, finding no single method consistently best. It introduces SEAR, an adaptive framework, which outperforms baselines and highlights the benefits of table structure refactoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the variability in LLM performance for temporal table reasoning due to diverse table structures and contexts, seeking an optimal prompting approach.

Method: The work investigates multiple prompting techniques across table types and introduces SEAR, an adaptive framework that dynamically adjusts based on context and integrates structured reasoning.

Result: SEAR outperforms baseline methods across all table types. Table structure refactoring (unified representation) also improves reasoning.

Conclusion: No single prompting method is universally optimal; SEAR's adaptability and structured reasoning enhance performance, and table refactoring aids model reasoning.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

*Liran Ringel,Elad Tolochinsky,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores learning a dedicated continue-thinking token to improve language model performance, achieving better accuracy than fixed-token approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning in language models by learning a specialized token for extended reasoning, outperforming fixed-token methods.

Method: Augments a distilled DeepSeek-R1 model with a learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, trained via reinforcement learning while keeping other weights frozen.

Result: The learned token improves accuracy on math benchmarks (e.g., 4.2% on GSM8K) more than fixed-token approaches (1.3%).

Conclusion: Learning a dedicated continue-thinking token is more effective than fixed tokens for extending reasoning and boosting model accuracy.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

*Yang Zhang,Amr Mohamed,Hadi Abdine,Guokan Shang,Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curriculum learning in pretraining language models improves convergence and performance, with up to 3.5% gains, using metrics like compression ratio and lexical diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of curriculum learning in pretraining language models is underexplored, prompting a systematic investigation.

Method: Experiments with vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula guided by six difficulty metrics.

Result: Improved convergence in early/mid-training phases and lasting gains (up to 3.5%) when used as a warmup strategy.

Conclusion: Data ordering is crucial in pretraining; actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development are provided.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

### [267] [Don't Pay Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11305)
*Mohammad Hammoud,Devang Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Avey is a new neural architecture that avoids attention and recurrence, enabling effective processing of long sequences while maintaining performance on short-range tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges with long sequences and quadratic attention complexity, while RNNs struggle with parallelism. Avey aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Avey uses a ranker and autoregressive neural processor to identify and contextualize relevant tokens, decoupling sequence length from context width.

Result: Avey performs comparably to Transformers on short-range tasks and excels at capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Avey offers a promising alternative to Transformers and RNNs, addressing their key limitations.

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

*Yi-Chien Lin,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer-based models' surprisal estimates predict human sentence processing difficulty, with higher perplexity models being less predictive. This trend holds for brain imaging data, not just latency-based measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if the observed relationship between Transformer model perplexity and surprisal predictive power extends to brain imaging data, beyond latency-based measures.

Method: Evaluated surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer models across three language families on two fMRI datasets.

Result: The positive relationship between model perplexity and predictive power persists, confirming generalization to neural measures.

Conclusion: The trend of higher perplexity models being less predictive applies to brain imaging, suggesting broader implications for language processing research.

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

*Yaohui Zhang,Haijing Zhang,Wenlong Ji,Tianyu Hua,Nick Haber,Hancheng Cao,Weixin Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs for pairwise manuscript comparisons in peer review, showing improved accuracy but revealing biases in novelty and institutional balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new paradigms for LLM participation in peer review beyond traditional workflows, aiming for more accurate quality assessment.

Method: Introduces a mechanism where LLM agents perform pairwise comparisons of manuscripts, aggregating results for robust quality measurement.

Result: The comparative approach outperforms traditional rating methods in identifying high-impact papers but shows biases in novelty and institutional representation.

Conclusion: While transformative, the approach highlights challenges like equity and diversity that future LLM-based review systems must address.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

*Peilin Wu,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A text-based approach for Speaker Diarization (SD) using Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection outperforms audio-based methods in short conversations, with the Multiple Prediction Model (MPM) showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-based SD systems face challenges like audio quality and speaker similarity. This paper explores text-based SD to overcome these limitations.

Method: Two models are developed: Single Prediction Model (SPM) and Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), using dialogue transcripts for speaker change detection.

Result: The text-based approach, especially MPM, performs competitively against audio-based SD systems, excelling in short conversations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of linguistic features and semantic understanding in SD, suggesting future research in multimodal and semantic feature-based diarization.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to evaluate demographic biases in LLMs by analyzing their responses to moral intervention scenarios, revealing baseline biases and differences in willingness to help across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial for fair and objective AI applications. This work aims to quantify biases related to gender, race, and age.

Method: The study prompts LLMs to assess moral patients' willingness to intervene, comparing biases across demographics to identify baseline identities and their relationships with other groups.

Result: Findings indicate baseline demographics are often white, middle-aged or young males, with non-baseline groups showing higher willingness to help.

Conclusion: The paper provides tools to objectively assess and address LLM biases, aiding developers in creating fairer models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Motivation: Addressing poor generalization in RE due to models' over-reliance on entities.

Method: Adapts a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework to compress entity-specific information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: The approach is robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded, effectively mitigating entity bias.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test
sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGLS improves pretraining efficiency by synchronizing model growth with data difficulty, outperforming baselines and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human cognitive development, CGLS aims to optimize learning efficiency in large language model pretraining by gradually increasing model depth alongside data complexity.

Method: CGLS uses progressive layer stacking, adding layers during training while transitioning from simpler (e.g., synthetic stories) to more complex data (e.g., technical content).

Result: CGLS outperforms baselines on benchmarks like PIQA and ARC, showing better generalization and zero-shot performance at 100M and 1.2B parameter scales.

Conclusion: CGLS effectively leverages progressive stacking to enhance model generalization, offering a simple yet powerful strategy for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Machine learning and LLMs were used to predict early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC), with fine-tuned LLMs showing 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising incidence of EoCRC in younger populations, who are below screening age guidelines, necessitates better predictive tools.

Method: Applied 10 machine learning models and compared them with advanced LLMs using patient data from 6 months prior to diagnosis.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieved 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in predicting EoCRC, potentially aiding early detection in younger populations.

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age
established by national guidelines for cancer screening. In this paper, we
applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey
prior to the CRC diagnoses. We retrospectively identified 1,953 CRC patients
from multiple health systems across the United States. The results demonstrated
that the fine-tuned LLM achieved an average of 73% sensitivity and 91%
specificity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chelsea is a framework for online KV cache clustering in LLMs, reducing memory usage by 80% and speeding up inference with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high memory and computational demands of KV caches in long-context LLMs, which current methods handle inefficiently.

Method: Divides sequences into chunks, uses Chunked Soft Matching for clustering, and merges KV caches into centroids.

Result: Achieves 80% KV cache reduction, 3.19x faster decoding, and 2.72x lower latency without performance loss.

Conclusion: Chelsea effectively balances efficiency and performance for long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR enhances RLVR for agentic environments by introducing agent guidance, improving performance in complex tasks like software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RLVR struggles in agentic settings due to sparse rewards and high failure rates.

Method: Agent-RLVR integrates agent guidance (strategic plans, feedback) to steer agents, validated by unit tests and updated via RLVR.

Result: Pass@1 performance improved from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified, further boosted to 27.8% with reward model training.

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR enables effective RLVR in complex environments, advancing agent training beyond traditional RL limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, specialized system for Korean Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) that competes with large language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3.

Method: Fine-tuned NLLB models with special language tokens for Korean GEC, evaluated using BLEU scores and an 'LLM as judge' method.

Result: KoGEC outperformed GPT-4 and HCX-3, showing balanced error correction, and a Chrome extension was created for accessibility.

Conclusion: Compact, task-specific models like KoGEC can compete with large general-purpose models in specialized NLP tasks, contributing to the field with a new evaluation method.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well on recalling surprising information but struggle to detect omitted content, as shown by AbsenceBench, where even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet score only 69.6% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify missing information, a critical but overlooked capability.

Method: Introduces AbsenceBench, testing models on detecting removed content in numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly (69.6% F1), likely due to Transformer attention mechanisms' inability to handle gaps.

Conclusion: Highlights a surprising gap between LLMs' superhuman recall and their failure in detecting omissions, revealing a fundamental limitation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

Conclusion: The platform's challenges and broader NLP applications are discussed, highlighting its potential impact.

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

*Jaehoon Yun,Jiwoong Sohn,Jungwoo Park,Hyunjae Kim,Xiangru Tang,Yanjun Shao,Yonghoe Koo,Minhyeok Ko,Qingyu Chen,Mark Gerstein,Michael Moor,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-PRM improves clinical decision-making by verifying reasoning steps with medical knowledge, boosting model performance by up to 13.50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models lack precision in identifying and correcting reasoning errors in clinical decision-making, which is critical for accurate diagnoses.

Method: Uses retrieval-augmented generation to verify reasoning steps against medical knowledge bases, ensuring fine-grained reasoning quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical benchmarks, improving base models by up to 13.50%, and integrates with models like Meerkat for 80%+ accuracy on MedQA.

Conclusion: Med-PRM enhances reasoning accuracy in clinical settings and is adaptable to existing models, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in biomedical research, with a focus on medical LMs. This paper evaluates their ability to identify immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts, finding pre-trained LMs outperform larger models for specific concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of language models in biomedical NLP, particularly their ability to understand medical concepts like immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer.

Method: Evaluation of medical conceptual grounding of various LMs by comparing their performance against expert clinicians in identifying immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts.

Result: Pre-trained language models outperform large language models in identifying very specific (low-level) medical concepts.

Conclusion: Pre-trained LMs show promise for specialized medical NLP tasks, especially for fine-grained concept identification.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

*Cole Gawin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BERT's relational understanding requires fine-tuning; pretraining alone doesn't encode structured relational schemata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if BERT's performance on semantic tasks reflects true conceptual competence or surface-level statistical associations.

Method: Examined BERT's internal representations of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations, comparing pretrained and fine-tuned models.

Result: Pretrained BERT shows latent relational signals but organizes concept pairs by relation type only after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can be induced via task-specific training, indicating behavioral performance doesn't guarantee structured understanding.

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

*Manlai Liang,Wanyi Huang,Mandi Liu,Huaijun Li,Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA) with LagKV compression to improve LLM efficiency in long-context tasks without added parameters or high overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficiency and performance degradation of LLMs in handling long-context input due to quadratic attention complexity and memory issues.

Method: Uses chunk-by-chunk prefilling with LagKV compression to select top K relevant key-value pairs in a lagging window, focusing on salient context.

Result: Enhances LLM robustness with key-value compression and improves fine-tuned performance in question-answer tasks.

Conclusion: LRSA with LagKV offers an efficient, low-overhead solution for long-context post-training in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

*Seongbo Jang,Seonghyeon Lee,Dongha Lee,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal dialogue response retrieval, comparing two-step and end-to-end approaches, with the latter showing comparable performance and a parameter-sharing strategy improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by enabling responses in multiple modalities (e.g., text and image) and improving retrieval-based systems.

Method: Formulates a multimodal dialogue response retrieval task with three subtasks, proposes two-step and end-to-end integration methods, and introduces parameter sharing.

Result: End-to-end approach matches two-step performance; parameter sharing reduces parameters and improves performance.

Conclusion: End-to-end methods are viable for multimodal dialogue systems, and parameter sharing enhances efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUDI improves personalized dialogue generation by using discourse relations and persona descriptions, enhancing response coherence and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized dialogue generation is challenging due to the need for coherence and consistency with user traits. Existing methods often lack implicit discourse understanding.

Method: MUDI uses a Large Language Model to annotate discourse relations and structure dialogue graphs. The DialogueGAT model encodes these graphs, and coherence-aware attention strategies enhance response generation.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in personalized response quality, making dialogues more human-like.

Conclusion: MUDI effectively addresses personalized dialogue challenges by leveraging discourse relations and structured learning, improving response naturalness.

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform specialized models for text diacritization in Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models hallucinate. Fine-tuning helps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for diacritization in typologically distinct languages (Arabic and Yoruba) and compare them to specialized models.

Method: Introduce MultiDiac dataset, evaluate 14 LLMs and 6 specialized models, fine-tune 4 small models using LoRA for Yoruba.

Result: LLMs outperform specialized models, but smaller models hallucinate. Fine-tuning improves performance and reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for diacritization, but fine-tuning is beneficial for smaller models to mitigate hallucinations.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

*Simeon Junker,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneGram, a dataset for analyzing how scene context affects human conceptualization of objects, and compares it to multimodal LLMs, which lack human-like variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scene context influences human conceptualization of objects and assess how well multimodal LLMs replicate this variability.

Method: Created SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes in various scenes, then analyzed references from multimodal LLMs.

Result: Multimodal LLMs do not capture the richness and variability of human conceptualizations.

Conclusion: Scene context significantly shapes human conceptualization, but current LLMs fall short in replicating this complexity.

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

TL;DR: LoRA-Gen framework leverages a cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models, improving efficiency and accuracy without specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of scaling language models for domain-specific tasks, especially in small edge-side models, by enabling flexible specialization and knowledge transfer.

Method: Uses a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models via reparameterization, reducing input context length for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning with competitive accuracy, 2.1x speedup, and 10.1x compression ratio in specific tasks.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen effectively enhances edge-side model performance and efficiency without requiring specialized training.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity of annotated CRF datasets by converting existing datasets into structured CRFs, demonstrating the challenge of CRF slot filling even for advanced LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available, well-annotated CRF datasets are scarce, hindering the development of CRF slot filling systems.

Method: A semi-automatic conversion methodology was applied to the E3C dataset in English and Italian to create a structured CRF dataset.

Result: Slot filling achieved 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English using zero-shot LLMs, with worse results for open-source models.

Conclusion: Filling CRFs remains challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, and the new dataset is released to support further research.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

*Alicja Dobrzeniecka,Antske Fokkens,Pia Sommerauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amnesic probing examines how removing specific linguistic information affects model performance. INLP, a common removal technique, introduces random changes, while MP and LEACE offer more targeted solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of behavioral explanations in models by refining the technique of removing linguistic information without unintended side effects.

Method: Compare INLP with Mean Projection (MP) and LEACE for targeted information removal in Amnesic Probing.

Result: MP and LEACE remove information more precisely than INLP, reducing unintended modifications and improving behavioral analysis.

Conclusion: MP and LEACE are superior alternatives to INLP for targeted information removal in Amnesic Probing, enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex sentences while preserving semantic and logical integrity, especially for video game design applications.

Method: Hybrid approach combining advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures.

Result: 70% success rate in simplifying complex sentences, outperforming the single-agent approach (48%).

Conclusion: The hybrid method is more effective for sentence simplification in this context.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into
sequences of logical, simplified sentences while preserving semantic and
logical integrity with the help of Large Language Models. We propose a hybrid
approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to
enhance the sentence simplification process. Experimental results show that our
approach was able to successfully simplify 70% of the complex sentences written
for video game design application. In comparison, a single-agent approach
attained a 48% success rate on the same task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a framework for dynamic AI behavior adjustment based on human-interpretable directives, addressing limitations of static preference models like DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the rigidity of static preference models in AI alignment, which assume monolithic preferences, by enabling dynamic adaptation to nuanced, context-dependent human feedback.

Method: CPT uses synthetically generated preference data conditioned on system prompts from fine-grained rubrics, allowing LLMs to adjust outputs at inference time without retraining.

Result: The framework provides fine-grained control and nuanced feedback modeling, with experimental artifacts (code, datasets, models) released.

Conclusion: CPT enhances AI adaptability and control, offering a scalable solution for dynamic preference alignment in language models.

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting traditional high-performance matrix multiplication (gemm) to mixed-precision integer arithmetic for modern hardware, showing performance gains over floating-point methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward reduced-precision formats in deep learning (DL) demands optimized hardware and algorithms, particularly for matrix multiplication, a core DL operation.

Method: The paper introduces novel micro-kernel designs and data layouts tailored for mixed-precision integer arithmetic across x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate significant performance improvements over floating-point implementations on modern CPUs.

Conclusion: The work marks a new era in gemm optimization, driven by DL inference needs, termed the 'Cambrian period' for matrix multiplication.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART is a self-distillation framework that replaces autoregressive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST) to improve efficiency in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive CoT reasoning in LLMs causes computational overhead, limiting use in latency-sensitive applications.

Method: DART introduces two pathways: CoT for traditional reasoning and ST for direct answer generation. It uses a Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align ST hidden states with CoT.

Result: DART achieves comparable reasoning performance to baselines while significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: DART is a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs), addressing the lack of systematic evaluation methods. It includes 100 PhD-level tasks and proposes two novel evaluation methodologies aligned with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which autonomously transform online information into high-quality reports.

Method: The authors present DeepResearch Bench with 100 expert-crafted tasks and propose two evaluation methods: a reference-based approach for report quality and a framework for assessing citation accuracy and retrieval capabilities.

Result: DeepResearch Bench and evaluation frameworks are open-sourced to facilitate the development of LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap in DRA evaluation, providing tools and methodologies to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the

*Tianqi Du,Haotian Huang,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses length generalization in LLMs by focusing on output distribution alignment across varying sequence lengths, proposing a metric and regularization term to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fixed context window in transformers limits LLMs' ability to handle long sequences, with length generalization being a key challenge.

Method: The study shifts focus from input features to output distribution alignment, introduces a metric (Long-Short Misalignment), and develops a regularization term for training.

Result: Experiments show a strong correlation between the proposed metric and length generalization performance, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The work provides new insights for improving long-context modeling in LLMs through output distribution alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

*Maximilian Kreutner,Marlene Lutz,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether zero-shot persona prompting in LLMs can predict individual voting decisions and aggregate policy positions of European groups, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.793 for simulating MEP voting behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the progressive left-leaning bias in LLMs and explore if persona prompts can align models with diverse socioeconomic groups for accurate political predictions.

Method: Uses zero-shot persona prompting with limited information to predict voting decisions and policy positions, testing stability against counterfactual arguments, prompts, and generation methods.

Result: Achieves a weighted F1 score of ~0.793 for simulating European Parliament voting behavior, with datasets and code made available.

Conclusion: Persona prompting can reasonably simulate political behavior, offering potential for bias mitigation and accurate policy prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

*Simeon Junker,Manar Ali,Larissa Koch,Sina Zarrieß,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) ability to resolve references in tasks with abstract visual stimuli, revealing challenges in pragmatic capabilities like context-dependent color interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the pragmatic abilities of MLLMs in reference resolution tasks, despite the simplicity of the tasks for humans.

Method: Investigating MLLMs' performance in tasks involving abstract visual stimuli (e.g., color patches, grids) for reference resolution.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic pragmatic capabilities, such as context-dependent color interpretation.

Conclusion: Even simple reference resolution tasks highlight significant challenges for MLLMs' pragmatic abilities.

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

### [299] [Post Persona Alignment for Multi-Session Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11857)
*Yi-Pei Chen,Noriki Nishida,Hideki Nakayama,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPA is a two-stage framework for multi-session dialogue generation that first generates a general response, then aligns it with persona memories, improving consistency and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long-term persona fidelity and conversational coherence in multi-session dialogues, often producing generic outputs.

Method: PPA reverses the traditional approach by generating a general response first, then retrieving persona memories and refining the response for alignment.

Result: PPA outperforms prior methods in consistency, diversity, and persona relevance on multi-session dialogue data.

Conclusion: PPA offers a flexible and effective paradigm for long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

*Xiaoran Liu,Siyang He,Qiqi Wang,Ruixiao Li,Yuerong Song,Zhigeng Liu,Linlin Li,Qun Liu,Zengfeng Huang,Qipeng Guo,Ziwei He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FourierAttention reduces KV cache memory demands in LLMs by leveraging heterogeneous head dimensions and Fourier projections, achieving top accuracy on long-context benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory inefficiency in LLMs due to growing KV cache, avoiding accuracy loss or computational overhead from existing methods.

Method: Uses Fourier projections for long-context-insensitive dimensions, approximating their evolution with spectral coefficients, and optimizes memory with FlashFourierAttention.

Result: Achieves best long-context accuracy on LongBench and NIAH, with efficient deployment via custom Triton kernel.

Conclusion: FourierAttention offers a training-free, memory-efficient solution for long-context tasks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

*Raphael Scheible-Schmitt,Johann Frei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeistBERT improves German NLP by pre-training on a diverse corpus, achieving SOTA results in tasks like NER and text classification, and releasing models under MIT license.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: German NLP benefits from updated architectures and datasets tailored to its linguistic characteristics, which GeistBERT addresses.

Method: Pre-trained using fairseq with WWM, initialized from GottBERT, and extended with Nyströmformer/Longformer for long sequences. Evaluated on NER and text classification tasks.

Result: GeistBERT outperformed base models and set SOTA in tasks, with base models sometimes surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: GeistBERT advances German NLP and is released under MIT license to support research.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework for assessing counter-speech effectiveness is proposed, with six core dimensions and strong classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defining criteria to evaluate counter-speech effectiveness is an open challenge in mitigating online hate speech.

Method: Proposes a framework with six dimensions (Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience Adaptation, Fairness) and two classification strategies (multi-task, dependency-based) on annotated datasets.

Result: Achieves high F1 scores (0.94 and 0.96) on expert- and user-written counter-speech, outperforming baselines and showing dimension interdependence.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust tool for classifying counter-speech effectiveness, with potential for community use and further research.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

### [303] [Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11930)
*Dongwei Jiang,Alvin Zhang,Andrew Wang,Nicholas Andrews,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to fully integrate near-perfect feedback, termed FEEDBACK FRICTION, even with advanced strategies, limiting their self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate how effectively LLMs incorporate extrinsic feedback under ideal conditions.

Method: Controlled experiments with solver models receiving targeted feedback from a generator with ground-truth answers, tested across diverse tasks and models.

Result: Models consistently resist feedback (FEEDBACK FRICTION); sampling-based strategies improve performance but fall short of targets.

Conclusion: Highlighting FEEDBACK FRICTION and ruling out causes aids future research in LLM self-improvement.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

*Samuel Simko,Mrinmaya Sachan,Bernhard Schölkopf,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A defense framework using contrastive representation learning (CRL) to improve LLM robustness against adversarial attacks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and current defenses lack generalization across attack types.

Method: Proposes a triplet-based loss with adversarial hard negative mining to separate benign and harmful representations.

Result: Outperforms prior defenses, improving robustness against input-level and embedding-space attacks without standard performance loss.

Conclusion: The CRL-based framework effectively enhances LLM defense against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs influence code style, analyzing trends in naming conventions, complexity, and maintainability across GitHub repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of LLMs on coding practices and characterize changes in code style due to LLM-generated code.

Method: Analyzed code from 19,000+ GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers (2020-2025), focusing on naming conventions, complexity, and similarity.

Result: Identified measurable trends, e.g., snake_case usage in Python rose from 47% to 51% (2023-2025), showing LLMs affect real-world coding style.

Conclusion: LLMs significantly influence programming style, with empirical evidence of their impact on naming conventions and other stylistic elements.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.
