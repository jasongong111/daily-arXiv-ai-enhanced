However,\nexisting methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative\nmodels first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques\nto reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and\ndistorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely\nfrom RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that\nachieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene\ncompletion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent\ngenerative scene completion through two key components: (1) a\ngeometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel\nviews in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene\nunderstanding from the reference image.
