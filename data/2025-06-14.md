### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes a trade-off in AI systems between provable correctness (error-free outputs) and broad data-mapping capacity (rich outputs), highlighting its implications for AI design and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The tension between symbolic AI's provable correctness and generative models' broad capabilities has been implicit; this paper aims to make it explicit and verifiable.

Method: The conjecture is stated in information-theoretic terms and analyzed through epistemology, formal verification, and philosophy of technology.

Result: The trade-off reframes AI engineering and philosophical expectations, impacting evaluation standards, governance, and hybrid system design.

Conclusion: Proving or refuting the conjecture is crucial for advancing trustworthy AI.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medical foundation models struggle with contextual errors due to their inability to dynamically adapt to new clinical contexts. The paper proposes context-switching AI to improve adaptability without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI models lack dynamic adaptability to new populations, specialties, or settings, leading to contextual errors.

Method: The paper suggests context-switching AI, which dynamically adjusts reasoning without retraining, to address this limitation.

Result: The envisioned AI could improve diagnosis, treatment, and access to care across diverse specialties and regions.

Conclusion: Context-switching AI offers a promising solution to enhance medical AI's adaptability and reduce contextual errors.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the difference between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease research, using machine learning and interpretability techniques to identify key features and emphasize the need for careful data interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of true disease drivers in Alzheimer's by distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers.

Method: Combined correlation analysis, XGBoost algorithm for classification, and SHAP values for feature interpretability.

Result: Identified key features like cognitive scores and genetic risk factors, showing strong correlations don't imply causation.

Conclusion: The study provides groundwork for future causal inference research, aiming to improve early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [4] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The thesis focuses on enhancing AI trustworthiness through safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability, introducing novel techniques like resilient safety shields, fairness shields, and a formal framework for assessing intentional behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly impact critical societal domains, ensuring their responsible use is crucial, but the concept of trustworthy AI is broad and multi-faceted.

Method: The work extends deterministic shielding for safety, introduces fairness shields for group fairness, and proposes a formal framework for transparency and accountability, unifying these under a reactive decision-making framework.

Result: The techniques are validated in simulations (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and provide practical tools for safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems.

Conclusion: The contributions advance trustworthy AI, offering practical solutions and laying foundations for future research.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [5] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces WGSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' strategic reasoning using wargame scenarios, focusing on multi-agent dynamics, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' advances in reasoning tasks, strategic reasoning—critical for human cognition—lacks systematic evaluation. This gap is addressed by WGSR-Bench.

Method: WGSR-Bench uses wargame scenarios to test LLMs on three core tasks: environmental awareness, opponent risk modeling, and policy generation, forming the S-POE architecture.

Result: The benchmark aims to evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities and design an LLM-based wargame agent for comprehensive assessment.

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench seeks to identify LLMs' strengths and limitations in strategic reasoning and advance research in model-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [6] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI is framed as a cognitive revolution, akin to written language, transforming human intellect and productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reframe AI as a cognitive engine, distinct from industrial mechanization, and explore its transformative impact on knowledge work and society.

Method: Theoretical framing, historical comparison, multidisciplinary analysis (computer science, economics, sociology), and conceptual frameworks.

Result: AI acts as an engine of cognition, amplifying productivity in cognitive tasks and reshaping work and society.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognitive abilities, heralding a new productivity paradigm requiring rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [7] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that verifying AI safety becomes exponentially harder as system capabilities grow, leading to a fundamental tension between safety and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational limits of verifying AI safety as systems become more powerful, highlighting the challenges in aligning advanced AI with societal safety needs.

Method: The authors formalize the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic and prove four core theorems using complexity theory, demonstrating the exponential growth of verification difficulty with system expressiveness.

Result: Key findings include: (1) exponential verification complexity, (2) vanishingly small safe policy fractions, (3) no universal alignment techniques, and (4) measure-zero robust safety properties for neural networks.

Conclusion: The work identifies an 'intractability gap' and presents a strategic trilemma for AI development: limit complexity, accept unverifiable risks, or innovate beyond verification. It provides the first systematic complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [8] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGC-Bench, a benchmark for AI agents in Pokémon VGC, highlighting challenges in generalization across diverse team strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of AI agents adapting to vastly different strategic landscapes in multi-agent learning, particularly in the complex, combinatorial domain of Pokémon VGC.

Method: VGC-Bench provides infrastructure, standardized evaluation, human-play datasets, and baselines like LLM agents, behavior cloning, RL, and game-theoretic methods (self-play, fictitious play, double oracle).

Result: In single-team settings, methods beat a professional VGC competitor, but struggle to scale with larger team sets, showing policy generalization remains a challenge.

Conclusion: Generalization across diverse team strategies in Pokémon VGC is an open problem, with VGC-Bench offering a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft, addresses challenges like insufficient data, task interference, and visual diversity using knowledge-enhanced data generation, MoE architecture, and multimodal reinforcement learning, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building a generalist agent with capabilities like perception, planning, and action in open-world environments like Minecraft is challenging due to data scarcity, task interference, and visual diversity.

Method: 1) Knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline. 2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Optimus-3 outperforms generalist MLLMs and state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations effectively address key challenges, enabling Optimus-3 to excel as a general-purpose agent in Minecraft.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework combining NEAT and PAL, improves training efficiency for StarCraft AI, achieving competitive play faster and exhibiting human-like strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of rule-based and deep learning approaches in StarCraft AI by enhancing adaptability and computational efficiency.

Method: Integrates NEAT with PAL, alternating low-fidelity training and high-fidelity evaluations to boost sample efficiency.

Result: PAL accelerates learning, achieving competitive play in half the time of standard NEAT, with emergent human-like strategies.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL enhance neuroevolution's scalability and effectiveness in complex RTS environments.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module and Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) to improve MLLM-based GUI agents for long-horizon tasks, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of insufficient knowledge and the offline-online domain gap in MLLM-based GUI agents for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Proposes HMS for hierarchical knowledge abstraction and SA-MCTS to bridge the domain gap, implemented in the Mirage-1 agent.

Result: Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32%, 19%, 15%, and 79% on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance GUI agent performance in long-horizon tasks, validated by the new AndroidLH benchmark.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

*Jintao Liang,Gang Su,Huifeng Lin,You Wu,Rui Zhao,Ziyue Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews Reasoning Agentic RAG, a framework enhancing LLMs with dynamic retrieval and reasoning, categorizing methods into predefined and agentic reasoning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of static RAG systems in complex, real-world tasks by integrating adaptive reasoning and tool use.

Method: Categorizes Reasoning Agentic RAG into predefined (fixed pipelines) and agentic (autonomous tool orchestration) systems, analyzing techniques in each.

Result: Provides a review of architectural designs, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination in Reasoning Agentic RAG.

Conclusion: Highlights research challenges and future directions to improve flexibility, robustness, and applicability of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection
of the relevant research has been organized into a

*Boris Sedlak,Alireza Furutanpey,Zihang Wang,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agent-based autoscaling framework for edge computing dynamically adjusts hardware and service configurations to meet constraints, comparing four agent types with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing's resource constraints require flexible scaling beyond traditional methods, motivating multi-dimensional elasticity.

Method: An agent-based framework tests four scaling agents (Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, Deep Active Inference) on YOLOv8 and OpenCV services.

Result: All agents achieve acceptable SLO performance, with Deep Q Network benefiting from pre-training, structural analysis converging quickly, and deep active inference offering scalability.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling is viable for edge environments, encouraging further research.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OIBench is introduced as a challenging olympiad-level informatics dataset to advance algorithmic reasoning in models, outperforming humans but still suboptimal to canonical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional benchmarks are saturated; a more challenging benchmark is needed to guide improvements in algorithmic reasoning.

Method: Constructed a 250-problem dataset with contamination-resistant properties, using Time/Space Completion Curves for efficiency analysis and human-model comparisons.

Result: SOTA models outperform most humans in correctness and efficiency but remain suboptimal to canonical solutions.

Conclusion: OIBench, released as open-source, aims to advance code reasoning capabilities in future LLMs.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on scientific cognitive capacities, revealing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific benchmarks inadequately assess MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities, focusing only on knowledge understanding.

Method: The SFE benchmark evaluates MLLMs through three levels: scientific signal perception, attribute understanding, and comparative reasoning, using 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across 66 tasks in five disciplines.

Result: State-of-the-art models GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 scored only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: The SFE benchmark aims to advance AI-enhanced scientific discoveries by addressing gaps in evaluating MLLMs' scientific cognitive abilities.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

### [16] [LogiPlan: A Structured Benchmark for Logical Planning and Relational Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10527)
*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures, with tasks like Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question. It reveals performance gaps among top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in logical relational reasoning, crucial for applications like network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business processes.

Method: LogiPlan dynamically varies task complexity by controlling objects, relations, and relational chain depth. It includes three tasks and evaluates models' self-correction.

Result: Performance gaps among models (e.g., GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7) correlate with scale and architecture. Models struggle with complex logical planning.

Conclusion: While reasoning-enhanced models perform well on simpler tasks, deeper logical planning remains challenging, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

### [17] [Primender Sequence: A Novel Mathematical Construct for Testing Symbolic Inference and AI Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10585)
*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Primender sequence, a hybrid integer sequence combining primality and modular digit conditions, to benchmark LLMs' symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds to assess LLMs' ability to infer hidden rules, validate hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic.

Method: Defines the Primender sequence, designs a structured prompt, and evaluates multiple LLMs on rule inference, hypothesis validation, and sequence generation.

Result: Comparative metrics assess LLM performance in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and pattern generalization.

Conclusion: The work provides a novel mathematical construct and methodology for benchmarking LLMs, bridging number theory, AI, and software engineering.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel diagnostic approach for cyber-physical systems requiring minimal prior knowledge, combining neural networks and graph algorithms, achieves high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing complex cyber-physical systems often demands extensive prior knowledge, which is challenging to obtain. This work aims to reduce this dependency.

Method: The approach uses a neural network-based symptom generator for anomaly detection and a graph diagnosis algorithm leveraging minimal causal relationships between subsystems.

Result: Experiments show 82% accuracy in identifying true causal components and 73% reduction in search space. Real-world tests confirm practical applicability.

Conclusion: The method is promising for diagnosing large, complex systems with limited prior knowledge.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TeleMath is a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs in solving domain-specific mathematical problems in telecommunications, showing specialized models outperform general-purpose ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLMs in specialized, mathematically intensive telecommunications tasks is unexplored, prompting the creation of TeleMath.

Method: A pipeline generates 500 QnA pairs from expert-crafted problems, evaluating various LLMs on this dataset.

Result: Specialized models for mathematical/logical reasoning perform best, while general-purpose models struggle despite their size.

Conclusion: TeleMath supports future research by providing a reproducible benchmark for LLM performance in telecommunications.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

*Tom Westermann,Aljosha Köcher,Felix Gehlhoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A pipeline formalizes and verifies informal AML modeling constraints using OWL ontologies, LLM-translated SHACL rules, and automated natural language interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AML modeling constraints are informal and lack automated validation.

Method: Map AML models to OWL ontologies via RML/SPARQL, use LLM to translate rules into SHACL constraints, and validate against the ontology.

Result: Complex rules can be semi-automatically checked without formal method expertise.

Conclusion: The approach enables automated validation of AML constraints, improving usability.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

TL;DR: ASPMT combines answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories, with a compiler (aspsmt2smt) translating tight ASPMT programs to SMT instances for solver processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories for more expressive reasoning, especially involving continuous changes.

Method: Developed a compiler (aspsmt2smt) using ASP grounder gringo and SMT solver z3 to translate tight ASPMT programs into SMT instances.

Result: The system effectively handles real number computations for reasoning about continuous changes.

Conclusion: ASPMT and the aspsmt2smt compiler enable efficient integration of ASP and SMT, expanding reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance neuro-symbolic models for counterfactual reasoning in video dynamics using causal graphs and Answer Set Programming (ASP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of neuro-symbolic models in answering counterfactual questions about video dynamics.

Method: Leverage symbolic reasoning with causal graphs and ASP to coordinate perception and simulation modules, using GPT-3.5/GPT-4 for dynamics simulation in CRAFT.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVRER and improves counterfactual reasoning on CRAFT with GPT models.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances neuro-symbolic models for counterfactual reasoning, validated on benchmarks.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OPT-BENCH is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on iterative optimization tasks, including ML and NP problems, showing that historical feedback improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' iterative reasoning and solution refinement capabilities, which are underexplored.

Method: Introduces OPT-BENCH (20 ML tasks, 10 NP problems) and OPT-Agent, a framework for iterative solution improvement using feedback.

Result: Historical context enhances optimization performance across tasks; experiments on 9 LLMs highlight the impact of iterations, temperature, and architecture.

Conclusion: OPT-BENCH and OPT-Agent advance LLM-driven iterative reasoning; all resources are open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

*Yu Zhang,Yang Hu,De Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining chain-of-thought reasoning and Model Context Protocol to improve LLMs' spatiotemporal behavior simulation, validated with real-world data in Shanghai.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for human spatiotemporal behavior simulation are computationally expensive and lack generalizability. LLMs, while promising, struggle with spatial reasoning and physical constraints.

Method: The framework integrates CoT reasoning with a five-stage cognitive framework and six MCP tool categories (e.g., spatial navigation, social collaboration) for comprehensive data processing.

Result: Experiments in Shanghai showed high similarity to real data (scores 7.86-8.36) and efficiency gains (generation time reduced from 1.30 to 0.17 minutes per sample).

Conclusion: The framework advances LLM applications in urban computing, offering a practical solution for synthetic mobility data and smart city planning.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Motivation: Classical AI planning lacks natural language understanding, while LLMs excel in interpreting human intents. Combining both can enhance task planning.

Method: GenPlanX combines LLMs for natural language task interpretation with a classical AI planning engine and execution framework.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy in office-related tasks, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.

Conclusion: GenPlanX shows promise for seamless human-AI collaboration in task planning.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI

TL;DR: ToxiMol is introduced as the first benchmark task for MLLMs focused on molecular toxicity repair, with a standardized dataset and automated evaluation framework (ToxiEval). Current MLLMs show potential but face challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity is a major cause of drug development failure, yet molecular toxicity repair lacks systematic definition or benchmarking.

Method: ToxiMol includes a dataset of 560 toxic molecules, a prompt annotation pipeline, and ToxiEval for automated evaluation. Nearly 30 MLLMs are assessed.

Result: Current MLLMs show promising capabilities in toxicity understanding and molecule editing but still face significant challenges.

Conclusion: ToxiMol fills a gap in benchmarking molecular toxicity repair, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current MLLMs.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen models even with spurious rewards, but results vary across model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can enhance mathematical reasoning despite unreliable reward signals.

Method: Applied RLVR with various spurious rewards (random, format, incorrect label, etc.) to models like Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3, and OLMo2.

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B showed significant performance gains (up to 27.1%) with spurious rewards, while other models did not. Code reasoning in Qwen increased from 65% to 90%.

Conclusion: RLVR may surface pretrained reasoning representations, but its effectiveness varies by model. Future research should validate RLVR on diverse models.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel MCIL method for vision, audio, and text, using multimodal pre-trained models, adaptive fusion, and contrastive training to address integration and forgetting challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCIL methods focus only on vision and text, leaving a gap for integrating audio. This paper aims to address this by exploring MCIL across all three modalities.

Method: The method includes a Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE), an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM), and a multimodal contrastive training loss. Two new MCIL metrics are also introduced.

Result: Experiments on three datasets confirm the method's effectiveness in integrating modalities and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances MCIL by incorporating audio, improving feature fusion, and introducing new evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOCL is a novel framework that adapts LLMs for graph tasks by converting node attributes into structured language and compact semantic embeddings, improving generalization and reducing token length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs and self-supervised methods are limited by reliance on labels or fine-tuning, while LLMs struggle with graph-specific challenges like token length and task levels.

Method: NOCL uses node description to convert attributes into natural language and node concept to encode them into compact embeddings, unifying graph tasks with language-based queries.

Result: NOCL achieves competitive supervised performance and superior zero-shot generalization compared to MPNNs and hybrid methods.

Conclusion: NOCL advances Graph Foundation Models by enabling LLMs to handle diverse graph tasks effectively.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

### [30] [Improving the performance of optical inverse design of multilayer thin films using CNN-LSTM tandem neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10044)
*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using deep learning, specifically tandem neural networks (TNNs), for inverse design of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films, comparing MLP, CNN, and LSTM configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse design methods are time-consuming due to extensive simulations. Deep learning offers a faster alternative.

Method: A TNN is implemented using MLP, CNN, or LSTM algorithms. The TNN combines an inverse neural network and a pre-trained forward neural network.

Result: LSTM-LSTM-based TNN achieves highest accuracy but longest training time. CNN-LSTM-based TNN balances accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM-based TNN is optimal for inverse design of thin films, combining CNN and LSTM strengths.

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed

*Shangpin Peng,Weinong Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Senqiao Yang,Xing Wu,Haotian Xu,Chengquan Zhang,Takashi Isobe,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO improves DPO by adaptively weighting preference pairs based on quality and model performance, outperforming baselines in textual and mathematical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Omni-DPO jointly optimizes for inherent data quality and model performance, adaptively weighting samples during training.

Result: Omni-DPO significantly outperforms baselines, e.g., beating Claude 3 Opus by 6.7 points on Arena-Hard and excelling in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO enhances data utilization and performance, proving robust and effective across tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in LLM-based systems by treating prompts as textual parameters and introducing a novel MCMC algorithm (MHLP) for inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs is critical for high-stakes applications, but challenges arise due to their closed-source nature and sensitivity to prompts.

Method: The authors interpret prompts as textual parameters, perform Bayesian inference using a small dataset, and introduce MHLP, a novel MCMC algorithm combining prompt optimization with MCMC.

Result: Empirical results show improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification across LLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work bridges Bayesian methods with LLMs, enhancing reliability and calibration in LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is crucial for safety-critical applications, but existing HVAE approaches often allocate latent dimensions arbitrarily, leading to ineffective representations or posterior collapse.

Method: The authors propose a theoretically grounded framework using information theory to optimize latent dimension allocation, proving the existence of an optimal allocation ratio under a fixed latent budget.

Result: Empirical results show that tuning the allocation ratio improves OOD detection performance across datasets and architectures, outperforming baseline HVAE configurations.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical guidance for principled latent structure design, enhancing robustness in OOD detection with deep generative models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-phase deep autoencoder system for unsupervised clustering of MNIST handwritten digits, combining reconstruction error and KMeans clustering loss for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and interpretable unsupervised clustering system for image data, leveraging deep learning and clustering techniques.

Method: Uses a two-phase deep autoencoder: first phase minimizes reconstruction error for latent embeddings, second phase combines reconstruction error with KMeans clustering loss. Includes batch normalization, dropout, and weight decay for stability.

Result: Achieves superior clustering performance (measured by Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, NMI, ARI) and clear t-SNE visualizations of digit clusters.

Conclusion: The method balances reconstruction accuracy and cluster purity, providing a scalable and interpretable solution for unsupervised image clustering.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

*Ahmed Elbakary,Chaouki Ben Issaid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated multi-task learning method using feature anchors and graph-based regularization for personalized, communication-efficient client collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable personalized learning in federated settings while maintaining communication efficiency and avoiding negative collaboration.

Method: Introduces feature anchors for compact representation, shares lightweight classification heads, and uses dynamic graph-based regularization with community detection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in performance, efficiency, and fairness on heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances personalization, collaboration, and efficiency in federated multi-task learning.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Nonnegative Diffusion (NnD), a learned generative model using score-based diffusion to reduce computational costs for simulating nonnegative objects like 3D clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural objects' complexity and variability make simulations costly; NnD addresses this for nonnegative objects.

Method: Uses annealed Langevin dynamics in a score-based diffusion model to enforce non-negativity during generation and inference.

Result: Generates 3D volumetric clouds consistent with physics and indistinguishable from real ones by experts.

Conclusion: NnD effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining physical accuracy for nonnegative object simulation.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph AL methods focus on static datasets and accuracy, ignoring user-centric factors like diversity and fairness in dynamic settings.

Method: Introduces GRAIL, a benchmarking framework with novel metrics to evaluate AL strategies in dynamic environments, balancing node importance, diversity, and topology.

Result: Experiments on dynamic datasets reveal trade-offs between performance and user burden, showing limitations in current AL strategies.

Conclusion: GRAIL provides a comprehensive evaluation mechanism for graph AL in dynamic settings, emphasizing the need to balance multiple factors for real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: A-CAPELLA, a decentralized algorithm, achieves logarithmic regret in no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm capacities by using collaborative hypothesis testing for capacity estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address coordination and capacity discovery challenges in decentralized MMAB under no-sensing conditions, where players lack collision information and arm capacities are unknown.

Method: Proposes A-CAPELLA, which uses synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation via structured collision patterns.

Result: Achieves logarithmic regret, proving efficient learning in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown capacities.

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA effectively solves the generalized MMAB problem under severe feedback limitations, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline Domain Randomization (ODR) improves sim-to-real transfer by fitting simulator parameters to offline data, outperforming standard DR with theoretical guarantees and practical enhancements like E-DROPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Domain Randomization (DR) ignores real-world offline data, limiting its effectiveness. ODR addresses this gap by leveraging available data for better sim-to-real transfer.

Method: ODR formalizes a maximum-likelihood estimation over simulator parameters, ensuring consistency and tighter error bounds compared to uniform DR. E-DROPO adds entropy to prevent variance collapse.

Result: Theoretical proofs show ODR converges to true dynamics with larger datasets and offers tighter sim-to-real error bounds. E-DROPO enhances robustness in zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: ODR, supported by theory and improved with E-DROPO, provides a more effective and robust approach for sim-to-real reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a convolutional RNN trained for Sokoban, revealing mechanisms akin to bidirectional search, with directional activations acting like a value function and specialized kernels forming paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a model-free reinforcement learning-trained RNN solves Sokoban puzzles and leverages test-time compute.

Method: Reverse-engineering the RNN's activations and kernels to identify mechanisms like directional state-action activations and path-forming kernels.

Result: The RNN's plan representation and value functions resemble bidirectional search, but with unique features like separate box consideration and layered plans.

Conclusion: The learned mechanisms are interpretable and analogous to classical search, despite differences, showing the potential for understanding model-free RL networks.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival analysis methods struggle with complex data and heavy censoring, necessitating more robust, nonparametric solutions.

Method: The models use interval-valued probability distributions for censored data, kernel-based regression with attention weights, and three decision strategies for training.

Result: Experiments show the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, outperform the Beran estimator in accuracy and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The models provide effective, nonparametric solutions for survival analysis, with iSurvJ being the most promising. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework is introduced for heart rate (HR) estimation using VO2 data, achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of heart failure (HF) is crucial, but current HR monitoring tools rely on population averages, lacking precision. Individualized HR tracking could improve cardiac health monitoring.

Method: The PMB-NN framework integrates physiological constraints from a simplified human movement model into neural network training, using VO2 data from 12 participants during various activities.

Result: The PMB-NN achieved a median R² score of 0.8 and RMSE of 8.3 bpm, matching benchmark models and outperforming traditional physiological models (p=0.002).

Conclusion: The PMB-NN enables personalized HR estimation and real-time cardiac monitoring, offering potential for improved HF detection in daily life.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

TL;DR: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings improve out-of-distribution recognition, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the discrimination between in- and out-of-distribution samples in deep learning.

Method: Introduces Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, optimizing hierarchical distortion and balance, and generalizes out-of-distribution scoring functions for hyperbolic prototypes.

Result: Outperforms 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions, beating state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings are superior for out-of-distribution recognition and enable hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCL introduces a probabilistic framework for contrastive learning, addressing uncertainty quantification while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability.

Method: VCL maximizes ELBO using InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adds KL divergence regularization. It models embeddings as a projected normal distribution.

Result: VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, improves mutual information, matches deterministic baselines in accuracy, and provides uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL provides a probabilistic foundation for contrastive learning, enhancing its reliability and applicability.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WBSAC improves sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by combining pessimistic and optimistic policies using Wasserstein barycenter for exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing poor sample efficiency in deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms, especially in sparse reward environments.

Method: Proposes WBSAC, which uses Wasserstein barycenter of pessimistic and optimistic policies for exploration, adjusting exploration dynamically.

Result: WBSAC outperforms state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms in MuJoCo tasks.

Conclusion: WBSAC offers a principled exploration strategy, enhancing sample efficiency in continuous control domains.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

*Defang Chen,Zhenyu Zhou,Can Wang,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a geometric regularity in diffusion-based generative models, showing sampling trajectories lie in low-dimensional subspaces with a consistent 'boomerang' shape. It proposes a dynamic programming-based scheme to optimize sampling time schedules, improving performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric properties of sampling trajectories in diffusion-based generative models and leverage this regularity for improved sampling efficiency.

Method: Analyzes sampling trajectories under closed-form solutions and proposes a dynamic programming-based scheme to align sampling time schedules with trajectory structure.

Result: Trajectories exhibit low-dimensional subspace behavior and a consistent shape. The proposed scheme enhances image generation performance, especially with few function evaluations.

Conclusion: The discovered trajectory regularity can be practically applied to improve sampling efficiency in diffusion models with minimal modifications to existing solvers.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to relax equivariance constraints in diffusion models for 3D molecule generation, improving scalability and efficiency while maintaining sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized equivariant architectures in diffusion models limit scalability and efficiency. The authors aim to address this by relaxing equivariance constraints.

Method: The approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to create an aligned latent space, then trains a non-equivariant diffusion model on these representations.

Result: The method outperforms non-equivariant models, matches state-of-the-art equivariant models in sample quality, and improves training/sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a scalable and efficient alternative to equivariant diffusion models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

### [54] [DynaSubVAE: Adaptive Subgrouping for Scalable and Robust OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10200)
*Tina Behrouzi,Sana Tonekaboni,Rahul G. Krishnan,Anna Goldenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE is a dynamic framework for adaptive OOD detection and representation learning, outperforming traditional methods in capturing heterogeneous subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often has underrepresented subgroups ignored by models, leading to harmful predictions. Existing solutions treat these as OOD instead of adapting.

Method: DynaSubVAE uses a dynamic Variational Autoencoder with non-parametric clustering (inspired by GMM) to update latent structures and detect OOD samples.

Result: DynaSubVAE excels in near-OOD, far-OOD, and class-OOD detection, outperforming GMM and KMeans++ in accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE effectively adapts to emerging data patterns, improving OOD detection and subgroup modeling.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Result: AWP outperforms existing LLM pruning and quantization methods.

Conclusion: AWP is effective for LLM compression, with theoretical support for pruning convergence.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the relationship between ECG and PCG signals, using machine learning to reconstruct one from the other, with non-causal LSTM models showing superior performance. Cross-subject and exercise conditions pose challenges, but envelope-based modeling improves generalizability. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers can be estimated from PCG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinct and overlapping information in ECG and PCG signals, their mutual reconstruction potential, and biomarker extraction under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.

Method: Used the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. Employed linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, for cross-modal reconstruction and analysis.

Result: Nonlinear models, especially non-causal LSTM, outperformed others. ECG reconstruction from PCG was more feasible than the reverse. Envelope-based modeling improved cross-subject generalizability. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers were estimated from PCG.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of ECG-PCG relationships, with implications for multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2 improves analog topology generation by introducing a succinct float-input canonical formulation (SFCI), addressing inefficiencies and low precision in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating analog topology design is essential due to manual efforts in modern applications, but existing methods suffer from inefficiency and low precision.

Method: LaMAGIC2 uses SFCI, an identifier-based representation, to reduce token length complexity (O(|V|)) and enhance numeric precision sensitivity.

Result: LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under tight tolerances, 10X lower MSEs, and up to 58.5% better transferability for larger circuits.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 is a robust framework for analog topology generation, outperforming prior methods in efficiency and precision.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DC-Clustering, a federated clustering method for complex data partitioning, ensuring privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing federated clustering methods in handling complex data splits (horizontal and vertical).

Method: Uses intermediate representations for privacy, supports k-means/spectral clustering, and requires one communication round.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized clustering on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills a gap in FL research, offering privacy, efficiency, and flexibility for sensitive domains.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning method for learning from noisy annotators by leveraging related tasks and estimating annotator abilities in a latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labels from multiple annotators (e.g., crowdsourcing) are noisy due to varying skills/biases, and sufficient data may not be available.

Method: Uses a neural network to embed examples into a latent space, estimates annotator abilities, and meta-learns the network to improve classifier adaptation via EM.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets with synthetic noise and crowdsourcing data.

Conclusion: The method efficiently handles noisy labels with limited data by leveraging meta-learning and probabilistic modeling.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDP relaxation for neural network verification faces interior-point vanishing in deep networks, losing strict feasibility. Five solutions are proposed, improving success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of strict feasibility in SDP-based DNN verification, which hinders scalability and reliability.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of interior-point vanishing, followed by designing five solutions to enhance feasibility.

Result: Proposed methods solve 88% of previously unsolvable problems, covering 41% of cases. Traditional constraints for ReLU bounds are found harmful.

Conclusion: The work identifies fundamental SDP limitations in deep networks and provides practical solutions, advancing reliable DNN verification.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-MLLM, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal graph learning paradigms, highlighting the benefits of joint visual-textual node attributes and fine-tuning MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal graph learning methods lack a unified benchmark, making it unclear how different approaches compare.

Method: The paper evaluates three paradigms (Encoder, Aligner, Predictor) using MLLMs across six datasets, focusing on multimodal graph learning.

Result: Joint visual-textual node attributes improve performance; converting visuals to text descriptions enhances results; fine-tuning MLLMs achieves state-of-the-art outcomes.

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM provides a fair evaluation framework and encourages further research in multimodal graph learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

*Moïse Blanchard,Vineet Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Col-UCB, an algorithm for minimizing collaborative regret in grouped multi-armed bandits by dynamically coordinating exploration across groups with overlapping action sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard algorithms often lead to imbalanced exploration costs between groups, motivating the need for a fairer approach to sharing exploration.

Method: The authors propose Col-UCB, which dynamically coordinates exploration across groups to balance the exploration burden.

Result: Col-UCB achieves optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret bounds, adaptive to shared action set structures.

Conclusion: Collaboration can significantly benefit groups when action sets overlap, and Col-UCB provides a balanced solution.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

TL;DR: Meta-learning improves sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia by adapting to author-specific behaviors, outperforming pre-trained models in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sockpuppet detection by addressing limitations of prior methods, which struggle with adaptability and data scarcity.

Method: Proposes meta-learning to train models across multiple tasks for rapid adaptation to new sockpuppet-group behaviors.

Result: Meta-learning significantly boosts prediction precision compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Meta-learning advances sockpuppetry detection and a new dataset is released for future research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

### [64] [PyLO: Towards Accessible Learned Optimizers in PyTorch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10315)
*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO is a PyTorch-based library designed to make learned optimizers accessible, practical, and efficient for real-world tasks, addressing gaps in prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between advanced learned optimizers (e.g., VeLO) and the broader community by providing a user-friendly, PyTorch-compatible solution.

Method: Developed PyLO, a library with CUDA-accelerated learned optimizers, tested on large-scale pre-training tasks like ViT B/16.

Result: Achieved significant speedups (39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec) and demonstrated compatibility with existing optimization tools.

Conclusion: PyLO successfully democratizes learned optimizers, showing their potential in real-world applications when combined with traditional methods.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Predicting AQI in 1 km² neighborhoods using Spatio-temporal GNNs, outperforming existing methods by 71.654 MSE (79% reduction).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQI data fails to capture local reality due to sparse sensors.

Method: Spatio-temporal GNNs applied to the AirDelhi dataset.

Result: 79% reduction in MSE (71.654 improvement), discovery of strong repetitive short-term AQI patterns and changing spatial relations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively predicts local AQI, revealing new insights and outperforming prior work.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Learning from Language Feedback (LLF), introduces a complexity measure (transfer eluder dimension), and presents a no-regret algorithm (HELiX) for solving LLF problems with performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled framework for learning from language feedback, addressing the lack of formalization in this area despite empirical progress.

Method: The authors formalize LLF, introduce transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure, and develop the HELiX algorithm for no-regret learning.

Result: The transfer eluder dimension captures feedback's impact on learning complexity, and HELiX performs well empirically, even outperforming repeated LLM prompting.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for principled interactive learning from language feedback, with HELiX demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

*Yanlong Chen,Mattia Orlandi,Pierangelo Maria Rapa,Simone Benatti,Luca Benini,Yawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A wavelet-based approach is introduced for analyzing physiological signals, addressing noise and non-stationarity. Pretrained models for EMG and ECG are developed, and a multi-modal framework integrating EEG is proposed, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physiological signals are often noisy and non-stationary, making traditional analysis methods ineffective. A robust, multi-scale approach is needed.

Method: A wavelet-based technique captures multi-scale features. Pretrained models for EMG and ECG are introduced, and a unified multi-modal framework integrates EEG via weighted fusion.

Result: Superior performance in downstream tasks, addressing noise, variability, and device mismatch. Outperforms existing methods in multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: The wavelet-based method and multi-modal framework advance physiological signal analysis, with potential applications in health monitoring and diagnostics.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

*Binyao Guo,Zihan Lin,QiZhi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HANO, a neural operator framework for modeling path-dependent inelastic materials, overcoming RNN limitations with autoregressive prediction and hierarchical self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address self-consistency and hidden state issues in RNN-based models for path-dependent material responses, enabling robust data-driven modeling.

Method: Develops HANO, an autoregressive Fourier-based neural operator with hierarchical self-attention for multiscale feature extraction, avoiding hidden state reliance.

Result: HANO outperforms baselines in accuracy, generalization, and robustness, handling complex conditions like irregular sampling and noisy data.

Conclusion: HANO is an effective surrogate for inelastic material simulation, suitable for integration with classical solvers.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeLoRA introduces a hierarchical gradient similarity-based approach for efficient continual learning in large pre-trained models, using bandit techniques and sparse updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency of continual learning in large pre-trained models to prevent catastrophic forgetting while adapting to new tasks.

Method: Constructs layer-wise adapters using hierarchical gradient similarity, employs bandit techniques for task similarity estimation, and uses sparse gradient updates.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in vision transformers and large language models across vision and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning in large pre-trained models.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PropInfer introduces a benchmark for property inference attacks on LLMs, demonstrating vulnerabilities in fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if property inference attacks, previously studied in discriminative and generative models, apply to LLMs, given their increasing use in sensitive domains.

Method: Developed PropInfer benchmark with two fine-tuning paradigms (question-answering and chat-completion) and proposed two attacks: prompt-based generation and shadow-model attacks.

Result: Empirical evaluations confirmed the success of the attacks, exposing vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs are susceptible to property inference attacks, highlighting a new security concern for their deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal representation learning framework to evaluate language model capabilities by modeling benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent factors, revealing a three-node causal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological challenges in causal evaluations of language models, such as confounding effects and high computational costs.

Method: A causal representation learning framework where benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of latent capability factors, controlling for base model variations.

Result: Identified a three-node linear causal structure explaining performance variations, revealing a causal direction from problem-solving to instruction-following to mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of controlling base model variations to uncover causal relationships among latent capabilities, providing deeper insights than simple rankings.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Motivation: Generic reward models lack nuanced evaluation for complex embodied tasks like EQA, which require understanding spatial, temporal, and logical aspects.

Method: EQA-RM is trained using Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions and provide structured rewards.

Result: EQA-RM achieves 61.9% accuracy on EQARewardBench with only 700 samples, outperforming models like Gemini-2.5-Flash, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5-Haiku.

Conclusion: EQA-RM offers a scalable, interpretable solution for EQA reward modeling, validated by strong performance on a new benchmark.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple
scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation
granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward
model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like high API costs, unreliable judgments, inflexibility, and biases in using LLMs to evaluate LLM responses.

Method: Uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of direct scoring, enabling local execution and adaptability.

Result: Improves judgment consistency by 15.83%, reduces biased responses by 23.7%, and outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on benchmarks with lower costs.

Conclusion: PAJAMA offers a cost-effective, interpretable, and less biased alternative to LLM-as-a-judge for automated model assessment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using a conditional GAN to estimate wildfire progression from satellite data and terrain, validated with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire models often diverge from observed progression, necessitating data assimilation for better predictions.

Method: A conditional GAN trained on WRF-SFIRE simulations estimates fire arrival times from VIIRS, GOES, and terrain data.

Result: Validated on five wildfires, achieving an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.

Conclusion: Terrain has minimal influence when satellite measurements are used for inference.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series data are often irregular and messy, but existing benchmarks assume clean, regular data, creating a gap between research and practical applications.

Method: Time-IMM captures nine types of irregularity, and IMM-TSF includes fusion modules for asynchronous integration and evaluation.

Result: Explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular data improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF advance time series analysis under real-world conditions, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining spectral clustering and cLHS improves SOC sampling by ensuring diverse environmental conditions are captured, outperforming standard cLHS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cLHS may overlook minor but important environmental clusters in SOC sampling, leading to less representative data.

Method: Integrates spectral clustering to partition the study area into homogeneous zones, then applies cLHS within each zone for diverse sampling.

Result: Spectral-cLHS provides better coverage of covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS.

Conclusion: The hybrid method enhances SOC prediction accuracy by improving training data balance for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Result: KANs accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and detect parameter changes.

Conclusion: KANs are effective for system identification in industrial systems, offering scalability and interpretability.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for

the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are resource-intensive, making edge device inference challenging due to memory and speed constraints.

Method: MNN-LLM employs model quantization, DRAM-Flash hybrid storage, weight rearrangement, and optimizations like multicore load balancing and mixed-precision operations.

Result: MNN-LLM achieves up to 8.6x speed increase compared to mainstream LLM frameworks.

Conclusion: MNN-LLM effectively addresses edge inference challenges, offering a practical solution for mobile deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant
computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs.
Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary
challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This

TL;DR: END is a new equivariant diffusion model for 3D molecule generation with a learnable forward process, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative modeling of 3D molecules by introducing equivariance to Euclidean transformations.

Method: Uses a learnable, time- and data-dependent forward process that is equivariant to rigid transformations.

Result: Competitive performance on standard benchmarks for unconditional and conditional generation.

Conclusion: END is a promising approach for equivariant molecule generation.

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for
molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations.
Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

TL;DR: LightGBM outperforms LSTM, XGBoost, and CatBoost in forecasting electricity DAM prices with short training windows, showing robustness and accuracy in detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of machine learning models in forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market prices using limited historical data, focusing on seasonal trends and price spikes.

Method: Evaluated LSTM with FFEC, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost across three European markets (Greece, Belgium, Ireland) using ENTSO-E forecast data, with training windows of 7 to 90 days.

Result: LightGBM consistently achieved the highest accuracy and robustness, especially with 45-60 day training windows, and excelled in detecting seasonal effects and peak prices.

Conclusion: Short-window training with boosting methods like LightGBM is effective for DAM forecasting in volatile, data-scarce environments.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

*Pascal Plettenberg,André Alcalde,Bernhard Sick,Josephine M. Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GNN-based method to automate PCB schematic optimization by adding components like pull-up resistors and decoupling capacitors, improving reliability and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual PCB optimization is time-consuming and often neglected due to a shortage of skilled engineers, leading to higher troubleshooting costs and electronic waste.

Method: The approach represents PCB schematics as bipartite graphs and uses GNNs for node pair prediction to automate component addition.

Result: GNNs achieve high accuracy in optimizing PCB designs, as validated on real-world datasets labeled by experts.

Conclusion: The method efficiently automates PCB design optimization, saving time and costs while enhancing reliability.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

### [82] [Size-adaptive Hypothesis Testing for Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10586)
*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, size-adaptive framework for fairness assessment using hypothesis testing, addressing statistical brittleness in intersectional analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness assessments ignore sampling error and treat small subgroups the same as large ones, leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in intersectional analyses.

Method: Combines a Central-Limit-based Wald test for large subgroups with a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator for small subgroups, ensuring reliable fairness metrics.

Result: Validated on benchmark datasets, the framework provides interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying data availability and intersectionality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves fairness assessment by accounting for subgroup size and data sparsity, offering robust statistical decisions.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

### [83] [Non-stationary Online Learning for Curved Losses: Improved Dynamic Regret via Mixability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10616)
*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, focusing on handling signal overlaps. It uses a U-Net for segmentation and adaptive grid detection for digitization, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurately digitizing ECG recordings, especially when signal overlaps occur. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: 1) U-Net-based segmentation to isolate ECG traces, and 2) adaptive grid detection for digitization.

Result: U-Net achieves 0.87 IoU. Digitization outperforms baselines (MSE: 0.0010 vs. 0.0015; rho: 0.9644 vs. 0.9366 for non-overlapping signals).

Conclusion: The method significantly improves digitization accuracy, especially for overlapping signals, and is publicly available for research and clinical use.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

*Thu Ha Phi,Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer,Florent Bouchard,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-rank factorization method for learning undirected graphs from node data, improving scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of scaling graph learning to large dimensions due to the quadratic growth of the problem size with the number of nodes.

Method: A low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix, solved using Riemannian optimization techniques, and applied to a low-rank constrained GLasso algorithm.

Result: Efficient dimension-versus-performance trade-off demonstrated on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses scalability in graph learning while maintaining performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

*Yucheng Yang,Tianyi Zhou,Qiang He,Lei Han,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in unsupervised reinforcement learning, identifies its limitations in skill diversity and separability, and proposes new metrics (LSEPIN) and objectives (WSEP, PWSEP) to improve downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical analysis in MISL regarding skill diversity and separability, and to improve downstream task adaptation.

Method: Proposes LSEPIN as a disentanglement metric, replaces KL divergence with Wasserstein distance for better geometric properties, and introduces WSEP and PWSEP as new skill-learning objectives.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows WSEP improves downstream task adaptation and discovers more initial policies than MISL. PWSEP can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Conclusion: The proposed methods (WSEP, PWSEP) outperform MISL by ensuring better skill diversity and separability, enhancing downstream task adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-R1 is a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to enhance multi-step reasoning in time series forecasting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods lack explicit intermediate reasoning, and LLMs with slow-thinking capabilities offer potential but face limitations like high computational cost and privacy risks.

Method: Time-R1 uses supervised fine-tuning for adaptation and reinforcement learning for generalization, with a multi-objective reward and GRIP for optimizing reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments show Time-R1 significantly improves forecasting performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Time-R1 effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning for time series forecasting, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

TL;DR: A novel method analyzes latent space geometry in generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric, validated on Ising and TASEP models, and revealing fractal phase transitions in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex geometry of latent spaces in generative models, particularly focusing on the Fisher information metric and its connection to phase transitions.

Method: Approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables to learn the log-partition function, defining the Fisher metric for exponential families, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Outperforms baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities and reveals fractal phase transitions in diffusion models, with geodesic linearity breaking at phase boundaries.

Conclusion: Provides insights into diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phase transitions, with practical implications for understanding generative models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT improves LLM output quality but faces limitations due to data shifts and poisoning, revealing worse performance on the $k$-parity problem compared to direct prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of distribution shifts and data poisoning on CoT's effectiveness, especially for the $k$-parity problem, where real-world conditions violate ideal assumptions.

Method: Investigates the joint effects of distribution shifts and data poisoning on CoT-trained models, using the $k$-parity problem as a case study.

Result: CoT leads to worse performance on the $k$-parity problem than direct prediction, with mechanistic explanations provided.

Conclusion: CoT's effectiveness is compromised under real-world data shifts, highlighting the need for robustness in training and evaluation.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in SOMs during continual learning by introducing a saturation mechanism.

Method: Extend SOMs with SatSOM, which gradually reduces learning rates and neighborhood radii for neurons as they accumulate information.

Result: SatSOM effectively retains knowledge by freezing well-trained neurons and redirecting learning to underutilized areas.

Conclusion: SatSOM enhances continual learning in SOMs by mitigating catastrophic forgetting through adaptive saturation.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of

TL;DR: SPLICE removes unwanted concepts from neural network representations while preserving label covariance, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often encode unwanted concepts, raising fairness and interpretability issues. Existing methods degrade useful signals.

Method: SPLICE uses an oblique projection to remove sensitive concepts while preserving covariance with target labels.

Result: SPLICE outperforms baselines on Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected attributes with minimal damage to task-relevant information.

Conclusion: SPLICE is theoretically unique and empirically effective for concept removal without harming label correlations.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

TL;DR: ConTextTab combines table-native ICL efficiency with semantic understanding from pretrained models, achieving SOTA performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table-native ICL models lack real-world data semantics, while pretrained models face context limitations. ConTextTab aims to merge these strengths.

Method: Uses specialized embeddings for data modalities and trains on large-scale real-world tabular data.

Result: Competes with SOTA on benchmarks and excels on the CARTE benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTextTab successfully integrates semantic understanding into table-native ICL, setting new performance standards.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Conclusion: Data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, enhancing reliability of AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of

Result: FGN outperforms state-of-the-art models in deterministic and probabilistic metrics, including tropical cyclone track predictions.

Conclusion: FGN is a simple, scalable, and flexible approach that advances ensemble weather forecasting.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence

Motivation: To address the gap in existing work, which only achieves error bounds exceeding the optimal by an absolute factor, this research explores relative error bounds in monotone classification.

Result: The paper presents nearly tight bounds for the cost required to achieve an error within (1 + ε) of the optimal, covering all ε ≥ 0.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of monotone classification by introducing relative error bounds and providing comprehensive theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

*Benjamin Hoover,Zhaoyang Shi,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Dmitry Krotov,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel energy function, log-sum-ReLU (LSR), is proposed for DenseAM networks, offering exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and emergent local minima, outperforming traditional LSE-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Dense Associative Memory networks by introducing a more efficient and creative energy function inspired by kernel density estimation.

Method: The log-sum-ReLU (LSR) function, based on the Epanechnikov kernel, replaces the traditional log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, enabling exact memory retrieval and introducing emergent local minima.

Result: LSR shows significantly more local minima (memories) with comparable log-likelihood to LSE models and demonstrates creativity in image datasets.

Conclusion: LSR has potential for large-scale memory storage and generative tasks due to its unique properties and performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores activation probes for detecting high-stakes interactions in LLMs, showing robust generalization and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of monitoring high-stakes interactions in LLMs for safety.

Method: Evaluates several probe architectures trained on synthetic data and tests their generalization on real-world data.

Result: Probes perform comparably to traditional LLM monitors while being six orders-of-magnitude more efficient.

Conclusion: Probes are effective for initial filtering in hierarchical monitoring systems, and the synthetic dataset is released for further research.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

*Ravishka Rathnasuriya,Tingxi Li,Zexin Xu,Zihe Song,Mirazul Haque,Simin Chen,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores efficiency robustness in Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs), categorizing attacks on their adaptive mechanisms and highlighting defense limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDLSs improve efficiency by adapting computation, but this introduces vulnerabilities to efficiency adversarial attacks, necessitating a systematic study.

Method: The authors present a taxonomy of efficiency attacks on DDLSs, categorizing them by dynamic behaviors, and evaluate adversarial strategies and defenses.

Result: The study identifies key challenges in securing DDLSs and shows current defenses are inadequate against efficiency attacks.

Conclusion: Novel mitigation strategies are needed to secure adaptive DDLSs against emerging efficiency threats.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning framework for detecting credit card fraud by analyzing transactional data, extracting behavioral features, and using unsupervised models to identify anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence of digital payments necessitates scalable fraud detection systems to address transaction anomalies effectively.

Method: The study merges multiple datasets, performs feature engineering to extract behavioral signals, and evaluates unsupervised models like Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and deep autoencoders. Clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN) are also used.

Result: The models flag the top 1% of anomalies, and PCA visualizations demonstrate their effectiveness in isolating fraudulent transactions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully identifies fraud patterns, offering a scalable solution for real-world credit card fraud detection.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how entropy regularization and constraints penalization in RL can robustly satisfy state constraints under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints in RL despite unknown disturbances.

Method: Analyzes the interplay between entropy regularization and constraints penalization, showing how entropy regularization promotes robust safety and how relaxing constraints can approximate the problem as unconstrained.

Result: Empirical evidence shows entropy regularization biases learning toward robust safety, and relaxing constraints preserves safety and optimality while improving resilience.

Conclusion: The connection between entropy regularization and robustness is promising for further research, enabling robust safety through simple reward shaping.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Duo, a method to improve uniform-state discrete diffusion models by leveraging insights from Gaussian diffusion, achieving faster training and sampling while outperforming autoregressive models in some benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models are slower and less performant than autoregressive and masked diffusion models, despite their self-correction potential. The paper aims to bridge this gap by utilizing Gaussian diffusion techniques.

Method: Duo transfers Gaussian diffusion techniques to uniform-state models. It uses curriculum learning guided by Gaussian processes to speed up training and introduces Discrete Consistency Distillation for faster sampling.

Result: Curriculum learning doubles training speed and outperforms autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Discrete Consistency Distillation accelerates sampling by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Duo successfully narrows the performance gap between uniform-state diffusion models and autoregressive models, enabling faster training and sampling while maintaining competitive results.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled way to attack finite mixtures of classifiers, defining two key properties (effectiveness and maximality) for such attacks. It critiques existing attacks for lacking these properties and proposes a new 'lattice climber attack' with theoretical guarantees, validated on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on finite mixtures of classifiers (randomized ensembles) are inadequate, prompting the need for a principled approach to evaluate their robustness.

Method: The paper conducts a geometrical analysis to define desirable attack properties (effectiveness and maximality) and introduces the 'lattice climber attack' with theoretical guarantees, tested on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Existing attacks fail to meet both effectiveness and maximality. The proposed 'lattice climber attack' demonstrates superior performance in the binary linear setting.

Conclusion: The 'lattice climber attack' provides a robust and principled method for attacking finite mixtures of classifiers, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

### [103] [Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10922)
*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Internal bias mitigation in LLMs reduces hiring biases effectively, even with realistic contextual details, maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of simple anti-bias prompts in realistic hiring scenarios where biases emerge despite controlled evaluations.

Method: Identify and neutralize sensitive attribute directions in model activations using affine concept editing at inference time.

Result: Bias reduced to under 2.5% across models, favoring equitable outcomes while preserving performance.

Conclusion: Realistic evaluations and internal mitigation are crucial for equitable LLM deployment in hiring.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoLoCo is a novel optimization method for training large language models without explicit synchronization, reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large models on low-bandwidth networks is costly due to synchronization steps; NoLoCo aims to eliminate this bottleneck.

Method: NoLoCo uses a variant of Nesterov momentum optimizer to implicitly synchronize weights by partial averaging with randomly selected replicas, avoiding collective communication.

Result: NoLoCo reduces communication overhead significantly, outperforms DiLoCo in speed and convergence, and avoids global blocking communication.

Conclusion: NoLoCo offers a scalable, efficient alternative for training large models on low-bandwidth networks, with faster convergence and reduced idling.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

TL;DR: CausalFM introduces a framework for training PFN-based foundation models for causal inference, using Bayesian priors and SCMs, and shows competitive performance in CATE estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a principled and flexible approach to causal inference in various settings, leveraging PFNs and Bayesian methods.

Method: Formalizes Bayesian priors for causal inference using SCMs, proposes causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks, and trains a foundation model for CATE estimation.

Result: CausalFM performs competitively in CATE estimation on synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalFM offers a novel paradigm for causal inference, potentially transforming practice in fields like medicine and economics.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

TL;DR: GUARD is a novel framework for LLM unlearning that improves retention of desired information while effectively forgetting specified data, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unintended forgetting in LLMs due to regulatory, copyright, and privacy concerns, while preserving model utility.

Method: Introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and an adaptive unlearning objective with nonuniform weights.

Result: GUARD enhances retention significantly (up to 194.92% improvement in Truth Ratio) while maintaining effective unlearning.

Conclusion: GUARD is a promising solution for balancing unlearning and retention in LLMs, validated by theoretical guarantees and experiments.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural sequence models that balance parallel training and fast sequential inference, introducing Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs) to unify and generalize existing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and expand the class of models supporting efficient parallel evaluation and sequential inference, bridging gaps between state space models and transformers.

Method: Defines PSMs by relaxing state aggregation operators, enabling non-associative functions like softmax attention, and evaluates them on language modeling and synthetic tasks.

Result: PSMs unify architectures like Mamba and GLA, offering O(1) compute per token and log(N) memory, while maintaining transformer expressivity and state space efficiency.

Conclusion: PSMs generalize existing models, achieving efficient inference and better length generalization in some cases, bridging the strengths of transformers and state space models.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents struggle with human-designed interfaces, prompting the need for interfaces tailored to agentic capabilities.

Method: Introduces the concept of Agentic Web Interface (AWI) and establishes six guiding principles for its design.

Result: AWI aims to overcome limitations of existing interfaces, enabling more efficient and reliable web agents.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for collaborative efforts to develop standardized, agent-friendly web interfaces.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

TL;DR: SEAL enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives, leading to persistent weight updates through supervised finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) lack mechanisms to adapt their weights dynamically. SEAL aims to address this by allowing LLMs to self-adapt.

Method: SEAL uses a reinforcement learning loop where the model generates self-edits (e.g., restructuring information, specifying hyperparameters) for finetuning, with downstream performance as the reward signal.

Result: Experiments show SEAL improves knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization, demonstrating effective self-directed adaptation.

Conclusion: SEAL is a promising framework for enabling LLMs to self-adapt, advancing toward more dynamic and adaptable language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments

### [111] [Execution Guided Line-by-Line Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10948)
*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural code generation method, EG-CFG, integrates real-time execution feedback into LLMs, improving performance by guiding generation with execution signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack execution feedback during inference, a key signal humans use. EG-CFG addresses this gap.

Method: EG-CFG uses beam search for candidate completions, executes them against test cases, and incorporates feedback into prompts.

Result: EG-CFG outperforms standard methods, achieving state-of-the-art results across coding tasks.

Conclusion: EG-CFG effectively leverages execution signals for better code generation, supporting parallel exploration of solutions.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

### [112] [ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955)
*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance is a wrapper method that improves sample realism and reward in diffusion-based inverse problem solving by reversing the probability flow ODE and reinitializing DPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods like DPS struggle with low signal-to-noise ratio tasks, often producing unrealistic outputs. ReGuidance aims to address this limitation.

Method: ReGuidance inverts a candidate solution by reversing the unconditional probability flow ODE, then uses the resulting latent to reinitialize DPS.

Result: ReGuidance significantly improves sample quality and measurement consistency in hard inverse problems like in-painting and super-resolution.

Conclusion: ReGuidance offers a theoretically grounded solution to enhance DPS performance, providing the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for such methods.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

*Zhaiming Shen,Alexander Hsu,Rongjie Lai,Wenjing Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes in-context learning (ICL) for regression of Hölder functions on manifolds, connecting attention mechanisms to kernel methods and deriving generalization error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of ICL, especially for structured geometric data, is lacking despite its success in NLP and vision.

Method: Establishes a link between attention mechanisms and kernel methods, analyzing ICL for regression tasks on manifolds.

Result: Transformers achieve minimax regression rates for Hölder functions, with error bounds scaling exponentially with intrinsic manifold dimension, not ambient space.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational insights into geometry's role in ICL and tools for analyzing nonlinear models in ICL.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Farseer introduces a refined scaling law for LLMs, improving predictive accuracy and reducing extrapolation error by 433% compared to Chinchilla's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and inefficiency of scaling insights from small LLM experiments to production systems.

Method: Systematically constructs a model loss surface L(N,D) for better empirical fit and extrapolation.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and generalizability, validated by training 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales.

Conclusion: Farseer enables reliable large-scale performance predictions and optimal compute allocation, with open-sourced resources for further research.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at
https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural operators as a way to generalize neural networks for mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling deep learning's success in scientific problems like PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disparity between finite-dimensional deep learning applications and infinite-dimensional scientific problems limits neural networks' impact in fields like PDEs. Neural operators bridge this gap.

Method: The paper distills key principles for constructing neural operators and provides a recipe to convert popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal changes.

Result: Neural operators can learn solution operators for classes of PDEs, adapting to varying boundary conditions, coefficients, and geometries.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical guidance for implementing neural operators, aiming to replicate deep learning's success in scientific applications.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Log Variance (LV) and reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) losses for diffusion bridges, showing rKL with log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) outperforms LV in performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LV loss for diffusion bridges and highlight the advantages of rKL-LD loss.

Method: Analyzes gradient equivalence and performance of LV and rKL-LD losses in diffusion bridges, supported by experiments.

Result: rKL-LD loss outperforms LV loss in performance, requires less hyperparameter tuning, and offers more stable training.

Conclusion: rKL-LD is a superior choice for diffusion bridges due to better performance, stability, and conceptual clarity.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based LoRA tuning method is proposed for flexible video editing using pretrained I2V models, preserving backgrounds and enabling controllable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods lack flexibility for specific edits and rely on large-scale pretraining. First-frame-guided editing is limited in controlling subsequent frames.

Method: The approach uses mask-based LoRA tuning to adapt pretrained I2V models, incorporating reference images and spatial masks for region-specific learning.

Result: The method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers efficient, adaptable video editing without altering model architecture, addressing flexibility and control challenges.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse introduces a vision architecture inspired by algorithmic search, enabling adaptive, interpretable feature refinement, outperforming conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited adaptive refinement in conventional vision backbones by incorporating algorithmic search principles for structured, interpretable processing.

Method: Uses recursive exploration modules for deepening feature analysis and adaptive calibration modules for dynamic salience adjustment.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often outperforming conventional models.

Conclusion: Algorithmic priors offer a principled strategy for efficient, performant, and structured vision backbones.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is a training-free framework that accelerates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by addressing computational and memory redundancies, achieving a 1.93X speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands in VLA models limit practical deployability, necessitating a holistic acceleration solution.

Method: EfficientVLA integrates three strategies: pruning redundant language layers, optimizing visual token selection, and caching features in the diffusion-based action head.

Result: Applied to CogACT, it achieves a 1.93X speedup, reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, and only drops success rate by 0.6%.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA effectively balances performance and efficiency, making VLA models more deployable.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD) to benchmark tools for detecting depictions of minors in digital content, highlighting the challenge of child detection with current methods achieving a 75.3% true positive rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no existing dataset or benchmark for detecting depictions of minors in a multi-modal environment, despite the need for automated tools to assess such content.

Method: The authors created ICCWD, a manually labeled dataset of 10,000 image-caption pairs, and used it to benchmark three detectors, including a commercial age estimation system.

Result: Child detection is challenging, with the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate.

Conclusion: The release of ICCWD aims to improve minor detection methods across various scenarios.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models
pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high
predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with
smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most

TL;DR: ViCrit is an RL proxy task for VLMs to localize subtle visual hallucinations in captions, improving visual perception across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending RL success in LLMs to VLMs is hindered by the lack of challenging yet verifiable vision-centric tasks.

Method: ViCrit trains VLMs to detect synthetic visual errors in captions, providing binary rewards for exact matches.

Result: Models trained with ViCrit show significant gains in VL benchmarks, including transfer to abstract reasoning.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism enhances visual perception in VLMs, as demonstrated by ViCrit and ViCrit-Bench.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoCA is a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, improving generalizability and adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying E2E autonomous driving across domains, as current methods lack robustness and incur high retraining costs.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution over driving tokens using Gaussian processes, learning basis tokens for diverse scenarios.

Result: RoCA enhances domain generalization and adaptation, outperforming direct finetuning in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: RoCA is effective for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, offering strong performance in generalization and adaptation.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Motivation: Ensuring diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models is challenging, especially across semantically similar prompts. Existing methods lack scalability.

Method: Proposes SPARKE, which uses conditional entropy for diversity guidance, dynamically conditioning on similar prompts and reducing computational complexity.

Result: SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity in generated data without significant computational costs, as tested on text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: SPARKE effectively enhances diversity in diffusion models while maintaining scalability, with code released for public use.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [127] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based emulator for surface solar radiation (SSR) retrieval, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features like albedo maps or cloud masks, and performs well in mountainous regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SSR retrieval methods fail in mountainous regions due to dynamic snow cover and changing surfaces, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: The method uses a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer to infer clear-sky surface reflectance from satellite image sequences, trained on HelioMont's SSR estimates over Switzerland.

Result: The model matches the performance of albedo-informed models, especially in mountainous regions, and improves generalization across terrains.

Conclusion: The proposed emulator effectively learns latent surface reflectance dynamics, offering a robust solution for SSR retrieval in complex terrains.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that improves accuracy and efficiency over traditional linear probing and existing attentive probing methods for self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing fails to capture the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM) due to distributed patch tokens, motivating the need for attentive probing. Existing methods are inefficient and over-parameterized.

Method: The authors propose Efficient Probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that reduces redundant projections and trainable parameters, achieving significant speed-ups.

Result: EP outperforms linear probing and prior attentive probing methods across seven benchmarks, generalizes beyond MIM, produces interpretable attention maps, and excels in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

Conclusion: EP offers a simple yet effective solution to the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in attentive probing, demonstrating superior performance and broader applicability.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for personalized vision-language retrieval by adapting a dual encoder model with regularized low-rank updates, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recognize new personalized concepts (e.g., 'my dog Fido') from few examples while integrating personal and general knowledge.

Method: Regularized low-rank adaptation of parameters in the language encoder's final layer, combined with parameter addition for multiple concepts.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 4%-22% on DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts vision-language models for personalized retrieval while preserving general knowledge.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

TL;DR: ScoreMix is a data augmentation method using diffusion models to improve discriminator performance with limited labeled data by mixing scores from different class-conditioned trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by leveraging diffusion models.

Method: Convexly mixes scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to generate challenging synthetic samples.

Result: Improves discriminative capabilities across benchmarks, especially when mixing distant classes in the discriminator's embedding space.

Conclusion: ScoreMix offers practical advantages for training discriminative models without extensive parameter tuning, addressing data collection challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset and multi-modal deep learning model for crop yield forecasting in California, integrating diverse data sources and achieving strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and timely crop yield forecasting is challenging due to complex environmental and climatic factors, despite extensive historical data.

Method: Developed a multi-modal deep learning model with stratified feature extraction and timeseries encoder, integrating satellite imagery, climate records, evapotranspiration, and soil data.

Result: Achieved an R2 score of 0.76 across all crops in unseen test data, demonstrating robust predictive performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark and model provide a foundation for improving agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySS is a novel method for 3D object detection in BEV using state-space learning and dynamic queries, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier methods rely on costly dense BEV features or inefficient sparse queries, prompting the need for a more efficient and effective approach.

Method: DySS uses a state-space model (SSM) to process features over time, with auxiliary tasks for better training, and dynamically updates queries via merge, remove, and split operations.

Result: DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on nuScenes test split, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, with real-time inference at 33 FPS.

Conclusion: DySS provides an efficient and high-performing solution for 3D object detection in BEV, leveraging dynamic queries and state-space learning.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

TL;DR: HalLoc is a dataset for probabilistic hallucination detection in vision-language models, featuring 150K annotated samples and a baseline model for efficient, concurrent detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of hallucination detection in large vision-language models, which current methods handle inefficiently and without nuanced outcomes.

Method: Creation of the HalLoc dataset with token-level annotations and development of a low-overhead baseline model for hallucination detection.

Result: The dataset and model enable graded confidence detection, improving reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Conclusion: HalLoc enhances the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world applications, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer classification, highlighting CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM as top performers. It also emphasizes uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods like ensemble techniques for reliable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is crucial for early treatment, but deep learning models face challenges like data scarcity and lack of uncertainty awareness.

Method: The study uses transfer learning with pre-trained models (CLIP variants, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, EfficientNet-V2-Large) and traditional classifiers (SVM, XGBoost, logistic regression). It also incorporates UQ methods (MCD, Ensemble, EMCD) for reliability assessment.

Result: CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM achieved the highest classification performance. Ensemble methods balanced accuracy and uncertainty handling, while EMCD was more sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating UQ into deep learning models enhances both performance and trustworthiness in medical diagnosis, making them more reliable for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual SOAP note generation is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. The goal is to automate this process with minimal annotations.

Method: Proposes a weakly supervised multimodal framework using lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate SOAP notes.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro. Introduces MedConceptEval and CCS metrics for clinical quality assessment.

Conclusion: The framework reduces clinician burden and reliance on large annotated datasets while maintaining clinical relevance.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of the Metaverse and the shift from professional to user-generated ODVs highlight the need for AVQA in this domain.

Method: A dataset of 300 UGC ODV videos was created, and a subjective AVQA experiment was conducted. A baseline model with video/audio feature extraction and fusion modules was developed.

Result: The baseline model achieved optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for future research in UGC-ODV AVQA.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

TL;DR: The study explores using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of students' academic emotions via facial expressions, finding moderate success with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised models for emotion analysis lack generalization and require repetitive data cycles, prompting the need for adaptable alternatives like VLMs.

Method: Two VLMs (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) analyzed 5,000 images of academic emotions using zero-shot prompting.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct performed better, excelling in happy and confused expressions but failing to detect distracted behavior.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise for academic emotion analysis, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct particularly effective for identifying confusion, though improvements are needed for distracted behavior.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework improves 3DGS for sparse views, outperforming NeRF and matching state-of-the-art 3DGS in few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with limited input views, causing overfitting and degraded rendering quality.

Method: Uses a stereo foundation model for pose estimation and dense point cloud reconstruction, encodes multiscale 2D features, and employs a self-attention-based point interaction network to enhance appearance representation.

Result: Outperforms NeRF-based methods and achieves competitive results in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables high-quality, real-time rendering from sparse views, addressing a key limitation of 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD is a method for local geometry-controllable CAD generation, addressing limitations of existing methods by using complementary captioning and LLMs to modify parts based on user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods struggle with following textual instructions or focusing on local parts, limiting design efficiency and customization.

Method: GeoCAD uses a complementary captioning strategy (vertex-based and VLLM-based) to annotate local parts, then trains LLMs to predict masked parts using geometric instructions.

Result: GeoCAD effectively generates high-quality, valid CAD models with strong text-to-CAD consistency, as shown in experiments.

Conclusion: GeoCAD offers a user-friendly, efficient solution for local geometry-controllable CAD generation, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be

Conclusion: The framework successfully quantifies urban style evolution, providing a data-driven tool for future urban design and research.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due

Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

### [141] [RealKeyMorph: Keypoints in Real-world Coordinates for Resolution-agnostic Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10344)
*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RKM is a resolution-agnostic method for medical image registration that avoids resampling by using real-world coordinates, outperforming fixed-resolution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning-based registration techniques resample images to fixed resolutions, introducing artifacts. RKM addresses this by working directly with raw data.

Method: RKM extends KeyMorph by training a network to learn keypoints in real-world coordinates using the scanner's affine matrix, avoiding resampling.

Result: RKM shows advantages in registering 2D and 3D medical images with varying resolutions, outperforming fixed-resolution methods.

Conclusion: RKM provides a robust, resolution-agnostic solution for medical image registration, eliminating resampling artifacts.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 is a new framework for text-to-motion generation that uses a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to improve semantic alignment and motion synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack controllability, consistency, and diversity due to poor capture of linguistic structures and logical reasoning.

Method: Motion-R1 integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to decompose instructions into structured action paths and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization for training.

Result: Motion-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic understanding and long-term coherence.

Conclusion: The framework enhances motion generation by improving interpretability and execution of complex commands.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui,Yuhan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSATFusion, a novel end-to-end fusion network, addresses limitations of CNNs in IVIF by integrating a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module and an improved Transformer module (ITM) for better global context capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods for infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) suffer from information loss due to limited global context capture.

Method: Proposes FSATFusion with FSAT module (frequency-spatial attention mechanism) and ITM (improved Transformer module) to enhance feature extraction and global context understanding.

Result: FSATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fusion quality and efficiency, with strong generalization and superior performance in downstream tasks like object detection.

Conclusion: FSATFusion effectively addresses CNN limitations in IVIF, offering high-quality fusion, generalization, and downstream task performance.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a unifying image processing framework to interpret self-attention mechanisms in Transformers, including components like positional encoding and residual connections, while also improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism in Transformers lacks a deep theoretical foundation. The paper aims to provide a mechanistic interpretation of its components and variants.

Method: The authors introduce a unifying image processing framework to explain self-attention and its architectural components, along with two independent modifications to Transformers.

Result: The framework not only enhances interpretability but also improves accuracy, robustness against data contamination, and long-sequence understanding in language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges gaps in understanding self-attention and demonstrates practical benefits of image processing-inspired modifications in Transformers.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseIDON, a computer vision pipeline, estimates object burial depth on the seafloor using deep learning and photogrammetry, achieving ~10 cm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding burial dynamics of seafloor objects is crucial for ecological risk assessment, pollutant transport, and hazardous material mitigation.

Method: Combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate object pose and seafloor orientation from ROV video, aligning CAD models for burial depth inference.

Result: Validated on 54 objects, achieving ~10 cm mean burial depth error and revealing sediment transport patterns.

Conclusion: PoseIDON enables scalable, non-invasive seafloor burial mapping, aiding environmental assessments at contaminated sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART is a dynamic adaptive region tokenizer that improves vision models by adaptively partitioning images into content-dependent patches, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-size patches in non-convolutional models like ViT and Vim often miss critical local details or encode excessive background regions, especially for sparsely distributed objects.

Method: DART uses learnable region scores and piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas, adding only ~1M parameters.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K) and reduces FLOPs by 45% while maintaining superior performance.

Conclusion: DART consistently enhances accuracy with minimal computational overhead, validated across models like DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconMOST is a data-driven guided diffusion model for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction, addressing sparse data and cloud occlusion issues in conventional and ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ocean reconstruction is vital for climate dynamics and marine research, but existing methods struggle with data sparsity, complexity, and computational costs.

Method: Pre-train an unconditional diffusion model on historical simulation data, then use sparse in-situ observations to guide the reverse diffusion process for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves MSE values of 0.049 (guidance), 0.680 (reconstruction), and 0.633 (total), handling over 92.5% missing data with high accuracy.

Conclusion: ReconMOST effectively extends ML-based SST reconstruction globally, maintaining accuracy and generalization, as validated on CMIP6 and EN4 data.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: Pisces, a multimodal foundation model, improves unified image understanding and generation by using decoupled visual encoders and tailored training techniques, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified models often underperform compared to specialized models due to differences in visual features and training processes for image understanding vs. generation.

Method: Introduces Pisces with a decoupled visual encoding architecture, tailored training techniques, and meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning.

Result: Competitive performance on over 20 image understanding benchmarks and robust generative capabilities on GenEval.

Conclusion: Pisces advances unified multimodal models by demonstrating the synergy between understanding and generation and the benefits of separate visual encoders.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel end-to-end IRSTD framework, LRRNet, leverages low-rank background properties for improved small target detection in complex infrared scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to low SCR, diverse target shapes, and lack of visual cues, leading to unstable deep learning performance.

Method: LRRNet uses a compression-reconstruction-subtraction (CRS) paradigm to model low-rank backgrounds directly in the image domain, avoiding patch-based processing.

Result: Outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and speed (82.34 FPS), with resilience to noise on NoisySIRST.

Conclusion: LRRNet is the first end-to-end deep learning approach for low-rank background modeling, achieving real-time, high-performance IRSTD.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF2Summ is a multimodal video summarization model combining visual and auditory features, outperforming DSNet with improved F1-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-modality methods fail to capture video semantics fully, necessitating a multimodal approach.

Method: MF2Summ uses a five-stage process: feature extraction (GoogLeNet, SoundNet), cross-modal attention, fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection (NMS, KTS).

Result: Achieves higher F1-scores (1.9% and 0.6%) on SumMe and TVSum datasets compared to DSNet.

Conclusion: MF2Summ effectively integrates multimodal data for superior video summarization.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDer is a robust MER framework addressing modality missing and OOD data, using self-distillation and causal inference with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle with modality missing and OOD data, often being impractical due to excessive parameters.

Method: CIDer combines Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) for robustness and Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) for OOD generalization, with efficient modules like WSAM and MCT.

Result: CIDer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training.

Conclusion: CIDer provides a practical, efficient solution for robust MER, validated by experiments and publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) method to improve Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC) by addressing limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for complex human body videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative video codecs struggle with human body videos due to complex motion patterns, leading to distortions and inaccurate motion in reconstruction.

Method: The paper introduces IMT to transform compact visual features into implicit motion guidance for better human body video reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show IMT enhances GHVC, achieving efficient compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: IMT effectively overcomes the challenges of explicit motion-based methods for human body video compression, improving performance.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to enhance transferability of adversarial examples for HSI classification by random block division, transformations, and feature distancing loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the vulnerability of DNNs in HSI classification to adversarial attacks, leveraging high-dimensional spectral data.

Method: Divides images into blocks, applies transformations, and uses feature distancing loss to disrupt true class features.

Result: Achieves effective transferability to black-box models and robust performance under defenses.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances adversarial example transferability for HSI classification.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Motivation: Improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization, as random weight initialization affects quantization robustness, is underexplored.

Method: Study of weight initialization effects on CNN building blocks and introduction of GHN-QAT, a method using Graph Hypernetworks to predict quantized DNN parameters.

Result: GHN-QAT improves quantized accuracy, even at 4-bit and 2-bit levels, and outperforms random initialization.

Conclusion: GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantization-aware initialization, with potential to enhance quantization-aware training in future work.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Piao Yang,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework for medical image reasoning segmentation, combining MLLMs' reasoning with precise mask generation, and presents the MedSeg-QA dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack active reasoning for complex clinical questions and struggle with precise segmentation masks, limiting their use in automatic diagnosis.

Method: Proposes MedSeg-R, with a global context understanding module and a pixel-level grounding module, leveraging MLLMs for reasoning and mask generation.

Result: MedSeg-R achieves high segmentation accuracy and interpretable textual analysis, validated on the MedSeg-QA dataset.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R advances medical image segmentation by integrating reasoning and precise mask generation, supported by a robust dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

*Shahroz Tariq,David Nguyen,M. A. P. Chamikara,Tingmin Wu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok show promise for deepfake detection but lack standalone reliability, excelling in interpretability and contextual analysis for hybrid frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deepfake detection using vision-language models (VLMs) due to their emerging capabilities in visual reasoning.

Method: Zero-shot evaluation of four VLMs on three deepfake types (faceswap, reenactment, synthetic) using a benchmark of authentic and manipulated images.

Result: VLMs detect surface-level anomalies and provide coherent explanations but are unreliable alone, with vulnerabilities to stylistic elements and misleading patterns.

Conclusion: VLMs are not yet reliable for autonomous detection but could augment human expertise in hybrid or human-in-the-loop frameworks.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized dataset and a fine-grained evaluation metric for OMR research, which lacks comprehensive benchmarks.

Method: Developed the SMB dataset with diverse musical textures and introduced OMR-NED, a normalized edit distance metric for detailed OMR performance evaluation.

Result: SMB and OMR-NED enable clear comparisons and error analysis for OMR methods, supported by baseline experiments.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in OMR evaluation, offering tools for benchmarking and improving OMR research.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to distinguish honey botanical origins using hyperspectral imaging, proposing a continual backpropagation (CB) method to enhance CIL performance by 1-7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate honey origin identification is vital for market value and consumer protection, but collecting all honey varieties for training is impractical.

Method: Researchers compared CIL algorithms on a honey hyperspectral dataset and introduced CB to reinitialize less-used neurons, improving plasticity.

Result: CB boosted most CIL methods by 1-7%.

Conclusion: The CB technique effectively enhances CIL performance for honey origin classification, addressing plasticity loss.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS), addressing challenges like dense annotations and complex scenes by combining coarse localization and fine segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods require dense annotations and struggle with complex scenes, prompting the need for a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: PSLG-SAM uses a visual grounding network for coarse localization and a modified Segment Anything Model (SAM) for fine segmentation, with train-free options to reduce annotation burden.

Result: PSLG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on datasets RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses RRSIS challenges, reduces annotation burden, and achieves superior results, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: J-DDL is a smart system for detecting and localizing surface damage on fighter aircraft using 2D images and 3D point clouds, integrating YOLO-based detection and novel optimizations for accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspections of fighter aircraft are inefficient and inconsistent due to large surface areas and structural complexity, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: J-DDL combines 2D images and 3D point clouds, using a YOLO-based detection network with lightweight Fasternet blocks, EMA modules, and Inner-CIOU loss for accuracy. Damage is mapped to 3D point clouds for precise localization.

Result: The system improves inspection efficiency and coverage, validated by experimental evaluations. A public dataset for aircraft damage is also introduced.

Conclusion: J-DDL advances automated aircraft inspection, offering a scalable and accurate solution for surface damage detection.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Conclusion: CogReasoner efficiently addresses CogStream, with code to be released soon.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species

system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) to detect subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems by analyzing genuine and impostor score distributions separately, focusing on tail probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to detect subtle biases in face recognition systems, especially in the tails of score distributions.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, with a configurable focus on tail probabilities. CEI^A automates this process for objectivity and ease of use.

Result: Experiments show CEI outperforms previous methods in detecting nuanced biases in state-of-the-art and intentionally biased models.

Conclusion: CEI is a robust and sensitive tool for fairness assessment in face recognition and can be generalized to other problems involving tail distribution analysis.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

TL;DR: A DiT-based framework for generating realistic human-product demonstration videos by preserving identities and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to maintain human and product identities or understand spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic results.

Method: Uses a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with paired reference info, masked cross-attention, 3D body mesh, and product bounding boxes for motion guidance. Structured text encoding enhances 3D consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in identity preservation and realistic motion generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of identity and spatial relationship preservation in human-product videos.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical imaging by improving cross-modal alignment of pathology observations, overcoming limitations of previous instance/token-wise methods.

Method: Proposes Pathological-Level Cross-Modal Alignment (PCMA) and a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor to align pathology details. Introduces a proxy task for correlation exploration among image patches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, retrieval, segmentation, detection, and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: PLACE effectively improves medical visual representation learning by focusing on pathological-level alignment and fine-grained details, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

TL;DR: DanceChat uses an LLM to guide music-to-dance generation, improving diversity and alignment with music styles by incorporating textual motion instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semantic gap between music and dance, along with the one-to-many mapping challenge and data scarcity, motivates the need for explicit guidance beyond music cues.

Method: The approach includes an LLM for pseudo instruction generation, multi-modal feature fusion, and diffusion-based motion synthesis with alignment loss.

Result: DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments and human evaluations.

Conclusion: LLM-guided dance generation enhances diversity and alignment, addressing limitations of implicit learning from music alone.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: T2I-PAL reduces the modality gap in CLIP by generating images from text captions, enhancing multi-label recognition with class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes, and combining prompt tuning with adapter learning for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap in CLIP limits image recognition performance when using text captions for fine-tuning. T2I-PAL aims to bridge this gap and improve multi-label recognition without requiring fully annotated training images.

Method: T2I-PAL uses text-to-image generation models to create diverse images from text captions, employs class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes for robust local feature representation, and integrates prompt tuning with adapter learning.

Result: T2I-PAL improves recognition performance by 3.47% on average over state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks like MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL effectively addresses the modality gap in CLIP, reduces annotation workload, and enhances multi-label recognition performance while maintaining compatibility with existing CLIP frameworks.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSphereDiff aligns hyperspherical data with directional noise, preserving class geometry and improving generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise, which is suboptimal for non-Euclidean data like hyperspherical manifolds, losing angular subtleties.

Method: Introduces HyperSphereDiff, using directional noise to align with hyperspherical structures and capture angular uncertainty.

Result: Theoretical and empirical validation shows improved accuracy and geometry-awareness in generative models.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff effectively preserves hyperspherical manifold structures, outperforming standard methods on object and face datasets.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

### [174] [Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582)
*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of random masking in self-distillation (DINO framework), proposing asymmetric masking to retain semantic info and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns that random masking may remove critical semantic info, prompting a need for better masking strategies.

Method: Apply random masking only to the student's global view, keeping local views and teacher's global view unmasked.

Result: Asymmetric masking yields more robust attention maps and better downstream performance on mini-ImageNet.

Conclusion: Targeted masking in self-distillation enhances model robustness and performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

### [175] [Hierarchical Error Assessment of CAD Models for Aircraft Manufacturing-and-Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10594)
*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical error assessment framework (HEA-MM) for aircraft CAD models is proposed, using structured light scanners for 3D measurements and analyzing errors at global, part, and feature levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring high quality in aviation equipment requires precise error assessment of CAD models during manufacturing.

Method: HEA-MM employs structured light scanners, point cloud registration, and hierarchical error analysis (global, part, feature). A novel optimization-based primitive refinement and a two-stage circular hole detection algorithm are introduced.

Result: The method effectively assesses errors in aircraft CAD models, demonstrating accuracy in global, part, and feature-level analyses.

Conclusion: HEA-MM provides a robust framework for error assessment in aircraft manufacturing, enhancing quality and reliability.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSP is a framework for oriented object detection in remote sensing, improving sample assignment and reducing instance confusion with semantic-decoupled spatial partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-density scenes in remote sensing require labor-intensive annotation, and existing point-supervised methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance confusion.

Method: SSP combines rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification, using pixel-level spatial partitioning for sample assignment and semantic spatial partitioning for box extraction.

Result: SSP achieves 45.78% mAP, outperforming PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%, and integrates well with ORCNN and ReDet, achieving 47.86% and 48.50% mAP, respectively.

Conclusion: SSP provides a superior, cost-effective solution for oriented object detection in dense remote sensing scenes, with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI uses WiFi CSI measurements and a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) to generate high-quality images of physical environments efficiently, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve image generation from WiFi CSI measurements by avoiding complex techniques like GANs and leveraging LDMs for better quality and efficiency.

Method: A lightweight neural network maps CSI amplitudes into an LDM's latent space, followed by denoising diffusion with text guidance and decoding to produce high-resolution images.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms baselines in computational efficiency and perceptual quality, validated on two datasets.

Conclusion: LatentCSI offers efficient, high-quality image synthesis with text-guided controllability, surpassing conventional methods.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

*Liang Yin,Xudong Xie,Zhang Li,Xiang Bai,Yuliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSTAR introduces a box-free scene text retrieval method with progressive vision embedding and multi-instance matching, outperforming state-of-the-art models while eliminating costly bounding box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text retrieval methods rely on expensive bounding box annotations and struggle with diverse query types.

Method: MSTAR uses progressive vision embedding, style-aware instructions, and multi-instance matching for vision-language alignment.

Result: MSTAR surpasses previous models by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text and 8.5% on the MQTR benchmark.

Conclusion: MSTAR is a superior, cost-effective solution for multi-query scene text retrieval, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets
are available at https://github.com/yingift/MSTAR.

### [179] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor introduces a method for generating consistent object textures from text descriptions, addressing issues in existing approaches by integrating resampling and adaptive camera positioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-texture methods suffer from texture inconsistency due to insufficient integration of synthesized textures and predefined camera positions.

Method: TexTailor uses a resampling scheme and fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model, along with a performance preservation loss and adaptive camera positioning.

Result: Experiments show TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: TexTailor effectively improves texture consistency by addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

*Konstantinos Vilouras,Ilias Stogiannidis,Junyu Yan,Alison Q. O'Neil,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underperformance of text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging, proposing a fine-tuning framework to improve alignment between radiology reports and chest X-rays, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent Diffusion Models excel in text-guided image synthesis for natural images but lag in medical imaging due to limited data and poor alignment of clinical text with scans.

Method: A fine-tuning framework is introduced to enhance multi-modal alignment in pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation for tasks like phrase grounding.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MS-CXR benchmark and robust results on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR).

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully improves alignment in medical imaging, demonstrating its potential for downstream tasks and broader applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model for multiple tasks (segmentation, classification, generation) while ensuring bi-directional consistency and preserving semantic information.

Method: Introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) with a symmetric learning objective, joint modeling of forward/reverse transformations, and a new training objective for semantic retention.

Result: Achieves FID scores of 11.9 (CelebAMask-HQ) and 7.0 (COCO-Stuff) with 25 inference steps; competitive in segmentation and promising in classification.

Conclusion: SymmFlow is a versatile and efficient framework for multi-task learning, outperforming previous methods in generative tasks and showing potential in discriminative tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 is an efficient fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models, improving performance without human supervision or extra data, achieving ~4% average gain with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for video diffusion models rely on human annotations and high computational costs, limiting practicality. GigaVideo-1 aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: GigaVideo-1 uses automatic feedback and a prompt-driven data engine to create diverse training samples, along with a reward-guided training strategy for optimization.

Result: On VBench-2.0, GigaVideo-1 improves performance across 17 dimensions (~4% average gain) using only 4 GPU-hours, without manual annotations or extra data.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 is an effective and efficient solution for fine-tuning video diffusion models, requiring no human supervision and minimal resources.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a prototype-based model using ViT for interpretable medical image analysis, improving biomarker localization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype methods lack consistency with human-understandable biomarkers and granularity in medical imaging.

Method: PiPViT uses ViT for long-range patch dependencies, contrastive learning, and multi-resolution processing to learn interpretable prototypes.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on retinal OCT classification with clinically relevant prototypes.

Conclusion: PiPViT provides transparent explanations, aiding clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN with SE block attention is proposed for efficient deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes challenge information authenticity, requiring advanced detection methods that are efficient and scalable.

Method: A lightweight CNN integrated with SE block for dynamic feature recalibration, emphasizing informative features.

Result: Achieved 94.14% accuracy and 0.985 AUC-ROC on the Style GAN dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a promising, resource-efficient solution for deepfake detection.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAC, a framework for generating adversarial CAPTCHAs using text prompts and LLMs, improving diversity and attack flexibility. BP-UAC, a variant for black-box scenarios, achieves high success rates with natural-looking CAPTCHAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to DNN-based attacks, and existing adversarial methods often distort images, making them unusable in no-image scenarios. UAC addresses these issues by leveraging text prompts.

Method: UAC uses LLMs to guide adversarial CAPTCHA generation. For targeted attacks, EDICT optimizes diffusion model latents. For untargeted black-box attacks, BP-UAC employs multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates, producing CAPTCHAs that deceive both humans and DNNs while maintaining natural appearance.

Conclusion: UAC and BP-UAC offer effective solutions for adversarial CAPTCHA generation, enhancing security against automated attacks while preserving usability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

### [186] [Underage Detection through a Multi-Task and MultiAge Approach for Screening Minors in Unconstrained Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10689)
*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task architecture for robust age estimation and under-age detection in images, addressing data imbalance and distribution shift with novel loss functions and rigorous evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images, overcoming challenges like distribution shift and under-representation of children in public datasets.

Method: A multi-task architecture using a frozen FaRL backbone with a two-layer MLP, employing α-reweighted focal-style loss, age-balanced mini-batch sampling, and an age gap technique.

Result: Improved performance: RMSE reduced from 5.733 to 5.656 years, under-18 detection F2 score increased from 0.801 to 0.857, and strong generalization under domain shift (e.g., F2 boost from 0.742 to 0.833).

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses data imbalance and distribution shift, demonstrating significant improvements in age estimation and under-age detection tasks.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm for hierarchical data, addressing the simultaneous learning of instances and classes in real-world applications like robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require models to handle both instance and class learning simultaneously, but existing methods focus on one or the other.

Method: Proposes HyperCLIC, leveraging hyperbolic space for hierarchical data, with hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives.

Result: HyperCLIC shows improved hierarchical generalization on the EgoObjects dataset.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC effectively handles hierarchical continual learning, balancing instance and class recognition.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

### [188] [Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion for Camouflaged Object Detection Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10712)
*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UMBD, a generative refinement framework for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), using uncertainty-guided masking and Bernoulli diffusion for targeted refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack post-processing refinement, leaving potential for improvement in segmentation quality.

Method: Proposes UMBD with uncertainty-guided masking and Bernoulli diffusion, supported by HUQNet for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves 5.5% MAE and 3.2% weighted F-measure improvements with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: UMBD effectively enhances COD performance by integrating generative refinement with existing models.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning method generates synthetic golden standards for InP wafer defect detection, outperforming traditional approaches and enabling efficient template matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing is labor-intensive due to lack of golden standards, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Proposes using Deep Neural Networks to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data, evaluating training objectives and image quality.

Result: Outperforms baseline decision-tree methods, enabling efficient defect detection with simulated golden standards.

Conclusion: The method enhances defect detection efficiency and is practically applicable in template matching for surface defects.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

*Hong Huang,Weixiang Sun,Zhijian Wu,Jingwen Niu,Donghuan Lu,Xian Wu,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP improves zero- and few-shot anomaly detection in medical tasks by integrating textual and visual information, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods lack adaptability to medical tasks and fail to distinguish anomalies effectively in joint embedding spaces.

Method: IQE-CLIP uses class-based and learnable prompting tokens and an instance-aware query module for anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six medical datasets in zero- and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP addresses limitations of prior methods and excels in medical anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a unified framework for generating aesthetic posters, outperforming baselines in accuracy, layout, and appeal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating aesthetic posters requires seamless integration of text, art, and layout, which existing modular pipelines fail to achieve.

Method: PosterCraft uses a cascaded workflow: text-rendering optimization, region-aware fine-tuning, aesthetic-text reinforcement learning, and joint feedback refinement.

Result: PosterCraft outperforms open-source baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and visual appeal, nearing commercial SOTA quality.

Conclusion: PosterCraft offers a robust, automated solution for high-quality poster generation, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA) for ultra-large image upsampling, addressing performance decline and blurring in prior methods by decomposing images into strokes and iteratively refining details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ASISR methods perform poorly for upsampling factors beyond training data, causing blurring. SbCA aims to solve this for ultra-large tasks.

Method: SbCA uses stroke vector amplifiers to decompose images into vector graphics for magnification and a detail completion module to restore missing details. A cyclic strategy iteratively refines details.

Result: SbCA outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling (e.g., ×100), eliminating artifacts, noise, and blurring, producing high-quality images.

Conclusion: SbCA is a unified, effective solution for ultra-large upsampling, trained once for all scales, and superior to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch, a text-only LRM with a modular multi-modal toolkit, outperforms MLLMs in long video understanding tasks without requiring extended context windows or strong visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that LVU tasks require MLLMs with extended context windows and strong visual perception by proposing a simpler, agentic framework.

Method: Uses a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with modular multi-modal tools (retrievers, visual perceivers) to selectively access and utilize video content.

Result: Achieves improvements of 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU, LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively, over MLLM baselines.

Conclusion: Agentic systems like VideoDeepResearch can effectively address LVU challenges without relying on complex MLLMs.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in current object-centric dynamic simulation methods by integrating physical knowledge and validating adaptability in diverse scenarios, especially involving fluids and objects.

Method: SlotPi combines a Hamiltonian-based physical module with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in prediction and VQA tasks on benchmark and fluid datasets, validated on a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: SlotPi's adaptability and robust performance pave the way for advanced world models.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional image-based controllers (fixed rates, motion blur, latency) by leveraging event cameras' asynchronous nature for adaptive control.

Method: Combines event-based perception, range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), with an initial imitation learning phase for efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates event cameras and reinforcement learning for adaptive, real-time navigation.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event

TL;DR: A zero-shot, text-queryable video summarizer (Prompts-to-Summaries) outperforms unsupervised and matches supervised methods without training data, using VidLMs and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of flexible, user-controllable video summarization tools that don't rely on domain-specific training data or incorporate natural language user intent.

Method: Pipeline includes scene segmentation, VidLM-generated descriptions, LLM-judged importance scores, and score propagation via consistency and uniqueness metrics.

Result: Surpasses unsupervised methods on SumMe and TVSum, competes on QFVS, and introduces VidSum-Reason dataset.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models with principled prompting enable universal, text-queryable video summarization.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

TL;DR: SmoothProper is a neural module for deformable image registration (DIR) that enforces smoothness and message passing, addressing challenges like sparse features and large displacements in unsupervised DIR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised DIR methods struggle with images containing sparse features (e.g., retinal vessels) due to unconstrained deformation fields post-training.

Method: SmoothProper integrates a duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms to propagate flow signals, enforce smoothness, and preserve structural consistency.

Result: On a retinal vessel dataset, SmoothProper reduces registration error to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, outperforming existing unsupervised DIR methods.

Conclusion: SmoothProper is a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution that effectively addresses aperture and large-displacement challenges in DIR without hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific pipelines and expert models, limiting scalability and flexibility. The authors explore learning directly from videos to overcome these limitations.

Method: A scalable approach annotates videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. A block-causal diffusion transformer is trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.

Result: The model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-turn benchmarks. It also shows promise in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing.

Conclusion: Learning in-context image editing directly from videos is feasible and effective, offering scalability and versatility beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOMAE introduces an occlusion-aware method for hand-object pose estimation using masked autoencoders, combining SDF and point cloud representations for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack global structural reasoning, limiting effectiveness in occluded hand-object interactions.

Method: Proposes target-focused masking, multi-scale feature integration for SDF prediction, and fuses SDF with point clouds.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: HOMAE effectively handles occlusions and improves pose estimation, with code and model to be released.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

### [200] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting, addressing accuracy and temporal coherence challenges with a two-stage strategy, global calibration, and optical flow assistance, achieving near full-precision performance even at 4-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is computationally intensive, and existing PTQ methods struggle with accuracy and temporal coherence. The paper aims to develop a specialized PTQ framework for video matting to overcome these limitations.

Method: The proposed framework includes a two-stage PTQ strategy (block-reconstruction optimization and global calibration), a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method, and an Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component to leverage temporal and semantic priors.

Result: PTQ4VM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization performing close to full-precision models while reducing FLOPs by 8x.

Conclusion: The paper presents a groundbreaking PTQ framework for video matting, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency, particularly in ultra-low-bit settings.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

*Yuxuan Luo,Yuhui Yuan,Junwen Chen,Haonan Cai,Ziyi Yue,Yuwei Yang,Fatima Zohra Daha,Ji Li,Zhouhui Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new task and the MMMG benchmark to evaluate image generation models' reasoning. It highlights challenges and proposes a unified KG representation and MMMG-Score for evaluation. Results show current models' deficits, and a baseline model, FLUX-Reason, is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images are vital for human learning, but generating them requires complex reasoning. Current models lack this capability, necessitating a benchmark to evaluate and improve them.

Method: The paper introduces MMMG, a benchmark with 4,456 expert-validated image-prompt pairs across disciplines and formats. It uses a unified KG representation and MMMG-Score for evaluation.

Result: Evaluations reveal serious reasoning deficits in 16 state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4o scoring only 50.20. FLUX-Reason, a baseline model, achieves 34.45.

Conclusion: The MMMG benchmark and FLUX-Reason baseline aim to advance knowledge image generation by addressing current models' reasoning gaps.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-step reasoning in large models using long narrative videos, human-labeled QA pairs, and a multi-phase evaluation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack focus on temporal reasoning and procedural validity, which VRBench addresses.

Method: VRBench includes 1,010 long videos, 9,468 QA pairs, and 30,292 reasoning steps. A human-AI framework generates coherent reasoning chains, and a multi-phase pipeline evaluates models.

Result: Evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench provide insights into multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench advances the field by offering a comprehensive tool for assessing multi-step reasoning in large models.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

*Zhao Zhang,Yutao Cheng,Dexiang Hong,Maoke Yang,Gonglei Shi,Lei Ma,Hui Zhang,Jie Shao,Xinglong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreatiPoster is a framework for generating editable, multi-layer graphic designs from natural-language instructions or assets, outperforming existing tools and systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for graphic design lack accuracy in incorporating user assets, maintaining editability, and achieving professional appeal, while commercial systems rely on impractical template libraries.

Method: CreatiPoster uses a protocol model (RGBA large multimodal model) to generate a JSON specification for layers and a conditional background model to synthesize coherent backgrounds.

Result: CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source and proprietary systems, demonstrated by a benchmark with automated metrics. A copyright-free corpus of 100,000 designs is released.

Conclusion: CreatiPoster advances AI-assisted graphic design, supporting diverse applications like canvas editing and multilingual adaptation, democratizing the field.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [204] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIR, a novel ZSGM method addressing offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space to improve image generation quality without target domain samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSGM methods assume perfect alignment between image and text offsets in CLIP space, leading to degraded image quality. The study aims to analyze and mitigate this misalignment.

Method: The paper first empirically studies offset misalignment in CLIP space, finding it correlates with concept distance. It then proposes AIR, an iterative refinement approach for better alignment.

Result: AIR outperforms existing methods in 26 setups, achieving state-of-the-art performance in qualitative, quantitative, and user studies.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of addressing offset misalignment in ZSGM and demonstrates AIR's effectiveness in improving target domain image quality.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M4V introduces a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for efficient text-to-video generation, reducing FLOPs by 45% and enhancing visual quality with reward learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency of Transformers in spatiotemporal modeling for video generation and improving multi-modal integration.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block for seamless multi-modal and spatiotemporal modeling, alongside a reward learning strategy for better visual realism.

Result: M4V reduces FLOPs by 45% compared to attention-based methods and produces high-quality videos, as demonstrated on benchmarks.

Conclusion: M4V offers a computationally efficient and high-quality solution for text-to-video generation, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectralAR, a framework for autoregressive visual generation using spectral tokens to address the causality issue in existing patch-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive visual generation methods use spatial patches, which contradict causality. The paper aims to resolve this by proposing a spectral approach.

Method: The method transforms images into ordered spectral tokens (low to high frequency) and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID on ImageNet-1K with 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Conclusion: SpectralAR effectively addresses causality in autoregressive visual generation while maintaining efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

### [207] [Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967)
*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner is a novel visual token pruning method for MLLMs that maximizes conditional diversity, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high inference cost in MLLMs due to redundant visual tokens, current methods either retain duplicates or ignore instruction relevance.

Method: CDPruner uses conditional similarity and determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize diversity of retained tokens, being training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: Achieves SOTA on vision-language benchmarks, reduces FLOPs by 95% and latency by 78% while retaining 94% accuracy in LLaVA.

Conclusion: CDPruner effectively balances performance and efficiency by focusing on conditional diversity, making it versatile for MLLMs.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: GenWorld is a high-quality, real-world simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection, addressing the lack of reliable datasets. The proposed SpannDetector model leverages multi-view consistency for superior detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated videos threatens information credibility, but current detectors lack reliable datasets.

Method: GenWorld dataset is created with real-world simulations, high-quality forged videos, and cross-prompt diversity. SpannDetector uses multi-view consistency for detection.

Result: SpannDetector outperforms existing methods, especially for high-quality videos, demonstrating the importance of real-world clues.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector advance AI-generated video detection by focusing on real-world plausibility and explainability.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadricFormer uses superquadrics for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based methods are inefficient, and sparse Gaussian representations struggle with diverse object geometries in driving scenes.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic superquadric mixture model and QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model with a pruning-and-splitting module for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: Superquadrics offer an efficient and accurate solution for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'HeadHunter' and 'SoftPAG' for fine-grained control in diffusion models by perturbing specific attention heads, improving generation quality and style manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining perturbation locations, especially in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures.

Method: Investigates granularity of attention perturbations, proposes 'HeadHunter' for head selection and 'SoftPAG' for continuous perturbation strength tuning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in quality enhancement and style-specific guidance on models like Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1.

Conclusion: Provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation, enabling interpretable specialization and practical perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast, reference-based 3D scene inpainting method that achieves real-time performance (0.4s) and outperforms prior methods by 1000x in speed while maintaining high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting methods are slow and impractical for real-time applications, necessitating a faster solution.

Method: InstaInpaint uses a feed-forward framework with a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy and a custom large reconstruction model (LRM) trained on large-scale data.

Result: Achieves 1000x speed-up over prior methods with state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and generalizes well to applications like object insertion.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint is a practical, high-speed solution for 3D scene inpainting, suitable for real-time and interactive applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneCompleter introduces a 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis framework using dense 3D scene completion, outperforming existing methods in coherence and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for novel view synthesis (NVS) rely on 2D completion followed by 3D recovery, leading to smooth surfaces and distorted geometry due to lack of 3D structure inference.

Method: SceneCompleter uses a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model for RGBD space synthesis and a scene embedder for holistic scene understanding.

Result: The method achieves superior visual coherence and 3D consistency in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter effectively fuses structural and textural information, demonstrating improved performance in NVS.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: A review and unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generative AI outputs across text, images, and audio, identifying five key paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a systematic framework for evaluating generative AI outputs across multiple modalities (text, images, audio) motivates this work.

Method: The paper reviews and organizes existing evaluation methods into a unified taxonomy, starting with text generation (most mature) and extending to image and audio.

Result: Five fundamental paradigms of evaluation methods are identified, and the framework is shown to be broadly applicable across modalities.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaskCraft automates the creation of scalable, multi-tool agentic tasks, improving AI model training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic benchmarks lack scalability due to human annotation costs, and instruction data misses tool interaction.

Method: TaskCraft uses depth-based and width-based extensions to generate complex tasks, producing a synthetic dataset of 36,000 tasks.

Result: The tasks enhance prompt optimization and supervised fine-tuning of agentic models.

Conclusion: TaskCraft supports scalable research on agent tuning and evaluation with its synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic degeneracy in natural language, showing that as expressions grow in complexity, recovering intended meaning becomes intractable. It tests this with LLMs, revealing non-classical contextuality in interpretation, and suggests Bayesian approaches over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the limitations of LLMs and NLP systems due to semantic degeneracy and to challenge the classical view of meaning in linguistic forms.

Method: Used Kolmogorov complexity to argue vanishing likelihood of recovering intended meaning and conducted a semantic Bell inequality test with LLMs interpreting ambiguous word pairs.

Result: Found CHSH expectation values (1.2-2.8) violating classical boundaries, showing non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

Conclusion: Classical frequentist approaches are lossy; Bayesian repeated sampling is more practical for characterizing linguistic meaning in context.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) behave differently with semantically equivalent prompts, introducing Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) to measure this drift. Findings show model-specific response shifts tied to tokenization and decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how LLMs respond to semantically equivalent prompts with different token-level realizations, addressing overlooked evaluation stability.

Method: Proposes PBSS, a diagnostic framework, and applies it to ten constrained tasks to measure behavioral drift in LLMs.

Result: Reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts linked to tokenization and decoding, indicating post-training instability.

Conclusion: Tokenization and decoding dynamics contribute to LLM instability under rephrasing, highlighting a need for improved evaluation methods.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartReasoner is a two-stage framework for precise visual reasoning over charts, converting images to structured code and synthesizing reasoning data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending large language models' reasoning to visual tasks without losing critical structural and semantic information in visualizations.

Method: A code-driven framework: (1) converts chart images to structured ECharts code, (2) synthesizes reasoning data, and (3) trains a multimodal model with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on four benchmarks, preserving chart details and performing comparably to GPT-4o with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner effectively bridges the gap in visual reasoning, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for tasks like chart question answering.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

TL;DR: Unsupervised algorithm ICM fine-tunes language models using their own generated labels, outperforming human supervision on superhuman tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human supervision is insufficient for models with superhuman capabilities, necessitating an unsupervised approach.

Method: Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) fine-tunes models on self-generated labels without external supervision.

Result: ICM matches golden supervision performance and surpasses crowdsourced human supervision on tasks like GSM8k-verification and TruthfulQA. It also improves frontier LM training.

Conclusion: ICM effectively elicits superhuman capabilities in models and outperforms human-supervised methods, demonstrating its potential for advanced LM training.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform comparably to experts in judging empathic communication, surpassing crowdworkers, and offer potential for emotionally sensitive applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how reliably LLMs judge empathic communication nuances compared to experts and crowdworkers.

Method: Compared annotations from experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs across four evaluative frameworks applied to 200 real-world conversations.

Result: LLMs approach expert-level agreement and exceed crowdworker reliability across all frameworks.

Conclusion: LLMs, validated with expert benchmarks, can enhance transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive tasks like conversational support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Result: Examined various techniques to identify efficient emotion analysis methods for Bangla.

Conclusion: The study contributes to emotion identification in resource-limited languages by evaluating multiple machine learning approaches.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and

22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

Motivation: Human capital is vital for corporate value but lacks standardized measurement or disclosure rules.

Method: Uses word2vec to create a lexicon of HC-related keywords, classified into five subcategories, and shares data and Python code.

Result: Provides a comprehensive HC lexicon and tools for researchers to analyze corporate communications.

Conclusion: Highlights future research opportunities in HC management and disclosure, offering reusable resources.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' story generation by using them for narrative planning, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. GPT-4 tier LLMs perform well at small scales but struggle with complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' story generation capabilities is limited due to evaluation challenges. Computational narratology provides insights for better assessment.

Method: A benchmark for narrative planning is created using literature examples, testing causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs generate causally sound stories at small scales but struggle with intentionality and conflict, requiring reinforcement learning for complex tasks.

Conclusion: The study reveals LLMs' limitations and potential in narrative planning, offering insights for future applications in game environments.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Motivation: Enhance identification and retrieval of videos related to complex events by leveraging parametric knowledge from LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Query-to-Event decomposition (Q2E) for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets and models, with entropy-based fusion scoring.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; integrating audio improves retrieval.

Conclusion: Q2E effectively leverages multimodal knowledge for improved video retrieval, with released code and data for future research.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LRMs' reasoning abilities beyond STEM domains, focusing on basic strategic and spatial reasoning tasks that are trivial for humans but challenging for models.

Method: Introduces TTT-Bench, a benchmark with four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, using a programmatic approach to generate verifiable problems. Evaluates diverse LRMs on these tasks.

Result: LRMs, even those excelling in math, struggle with TTT-Bench, scoring 41% and 5% lower compared to math benchmarks. Larger models perform better but fail in long-term strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: LRMs lack robust reasoning in simple strategic tasks, highlighting a gap in their generalization beyond STEM domains.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying unreliable narrators in texts using computational methods, bridging literary theory and real-world applications.

Method: Uses TUNa, a human-annotated dataset, to define and classify unreliability types (intra-narrational, inter-narrational, inter-textual). Evaluates LLMs with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning.

Result: The task is challenging, but LLMs show potential for identifying unreliable narrators.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulty of the task and encourages future research, releasing the dataset and code for further exploration.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a large-scale, fine-grained hate-speech dataset for Portuguese, especially for legally protected minority groups.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) manual seed curation, (2) few-shot expansion with an LLM, (3) paraphrase augmentation, (4) enrichment and neutral text addition.

Result: The corpus is balanced, diverse, and generalizes well across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT advances synthetic data and hate-speech detection research in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions like humans, showing they can behave deterministically. It proposes a method to distinguish stochastic vs. deterministic patterns in Gibbs sampling to avoid inferring false priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models have Bayesian brains and to address the validity of prior methods for inferring their priors, given their potential deterministic behavior.

Method: Revisits Gibbs sampling assumptions, proposes a method to differentiate stochastic and deterministic decision patterns, and tests on large language models under varying conditions.

Result: Language models can exhibit near-deterministic behavior, undermining prior methods for eliciting human-like priors. A false prior can emerge if deterministic behavior is misinterpreted.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for careful scrutiny of language model decision-making patterns to avoid misleading inferences about their priors, offering a method for better analysis.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

Motivation: Traditional gradient-based data selection for fine-tuning large language models is resource-intensive, making it impractical.

Method: Clusters training data by gradient features, frames inter-cluster selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, and uses a modified UCB algorithm with cold start for exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: ClusterUCB achieves comparable performance to original gradient-based methods with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for efficient data selection in fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [230] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick is a novel method for few-label text classification in low-resource languages, improving pseudo-label quality by refining high-confidence labels from broad clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation in low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods struggle.

Method: Flick introduces a pseudo-label refinement component, focusing on single-cluster cohesion and adaptive top-k selection to distill reliable pseudo-labels.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance across 14 diverse datasets, including low-resource languages like Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana.

Conclusion: Flick effectively mitigates error propagation in low-resource settings, enabling robust fine-tuning with minimal true labels.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [231] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' response quality in education varies with query framing, showing sycophantic behavior (agreeing with user suggestions). Smaller models exhibit stronger bias, impacting educational equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how user suggestions influence LLMs in education, where sycophancy risks reinforcing misunderstandings.

Method: Tested five LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 classes) under five conditions, analyzing response quality, answer flips, and token probabilities.

Result: LLMs' correctness drops by 15% with incorrect suggestions and rises by 15% with correct ones. Smaller models show up to 30% bias (vs. 8% in larger ones).

Conclusion: Sycophantic behavior in LLMs risks educational inequity, necessitating better understanding and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes scheduled interleaved speech-text training to improve speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) by adapting LLMs to speech modality progressively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of adapting text-trained LLMs to speech modality due to limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: Uses interleaved speech-text units during training, gradually reducing text ratio to aid modality adaptation. Fine-tunes LLaMA3.2-1B on CVSS dataset.

Result: Consistent improvement in translation performance, especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: Scheduled interleaved training effectively bridges the modality gap in S2ST.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for training large language models (LLMs) with CoT.

Method: Extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and converts them into natural language CoT reasoning.

Result: Effective transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks, with highly accurate reasoning data and reduced token length during inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances LLM reasoning by providing scalable, high-quality CoT supervision, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableRAG improves RAG for heterogeneous documents by preserving tabular structure and enabling multi-hop reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods fail with heterogeneous documents (text + tables) due to flattened tables and disrupted reasoning.

Method: TableRAG combines text retrieval, SQL execution, and answer generation in four iterative steps.

Result: TableRAG outperforms baselines on public datasets and HeteQA, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: TableRAG advances heterogeneous document QA by unifying text and tabular data processing.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAG is a framework enabling LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles, improving reasoning and verification without separate models or multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with self-verification; existing solutions are unscalable due to reliance on separate verifiers or complex pipelines.

Method: PAG uses a unified RL paradigm where the model alternates roles, selectively revising answers only when errors are detected.

Result: PAG improves reasoning and verification, outperforming self-consistency and enhancing direct generation accuracy.

Conclusion: PAG offers a scalable, effective solution for LLM self-correction, advancing both reasoning and verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The TempVS benchmark evaluates MLLMs' temporal grounding and reasoning in image sequences, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve MLLMs' ability to understand temporal order in multimodal (visual and linguistic) contexts.

Method: TempVS includes three tests (event relation inference, sentence ordering, image ordering) with grounding tests, evaluating 38 MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs struggle with TempVS, showing significant performance gaps versus humans.

Conclusion: TempVS highlights challenges and future research directions for MLLMs in temporal reasoning, with data and code publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

*Avneet Kaur,Arnav Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes news media framing of the Israel-Palestine conflict, revealing a bias toward war journalism and regional differences in reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on conflict framing are limited by qualitative methods or superficial analysis, prompting a deeper computational approach.

Method: Combines frame semantics and large language models to analyze communicative and linguistic framing in news articles.

Result: Finds a higher focus on war-based reporting and regional biases in framing assailants and victims.

Conclusion: Highlights media biases and the need for more balanced conflict reporting.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve LLM reasoning efficiency by balancing conciseness and accuracy, using a novel penalty for output length, and shows success across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods often produce lengthy outputs, increasing latency, and uniform penalties for length don't account for problem complexity, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The approach divides the reward function and introduces a novel penalty for output length to manage reasoning efficiency, adapting conciseness to problem complexity.

Result: The method shortens outputs for simpler datasets (GSM8K, MATH500) while maintaining accuracy and improves accuracy for the complex AIME2024 dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully enhances LLM reasoning efficiency by tailoring conciseness to problem complexity, improving performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

*Xanh Ho,Sunisth Kumar,Yun-Ang Wu,Florian Boudin,Atsuhiro Takasu,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reframes table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify essential table cells for claim verification, and introduces a dataset with human-annotated rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting claim labels alone lacks interpretability; understanding model reasoning is crucial.

Method: Extend SciTab benchmark with cell-level rationales, propose a taxonomy for ambiguous cases, and evaluate LLMs.

Result: Incorporating table alignment improves verification; LLMs often predict correctly but lack faithful reasoning.

Conclusion: Explanation tasks enhance interpretability, but LLMs need improvement in aligning with human reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

*Aleksandra Sorokovikova,Pavel Chizhov,Iuliia Eremenko,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines bias in large language models (LLMs) through proxy measures, revealing negligible bias in pre-prompted personae evaluations but significant bias in grading user answers and salary negotiation advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how biases in training data manifest in LLMs, especially with trends toward personalized models that already know user demographics.

Method: Evaluated LLMs using pre-prompted personae on MMLU, reformulated tasks for grading user answers, and analyzed salary negotiation advice.

Result: Pre-prompted personae showed negligible bias, but grading tasks and salary advice revealed significant bias.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs is context-dependent, and personalization trends may exacerbate the issue without explicit user prompts.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tina, a tiny reasoning model, achieves strong performance with minimal resources using LoRA and RL, outperforming SOTA models at a fraction of the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cost-effective ways to achieve strong reasoning in language models.

Method: Uses parameter-efficient updates (LoRA) during RL on a 1.5B parameter base model.

Result: Competitive/superior reasoning performance at 260x lower cost; 43.33% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24.

Conclusion: LoRA-based RL is surprisingly effective for efficient reasoning, preserving base knowledge while adapting to RL rewards.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

TL;DR: LLMs show strong zero-shot DST performance but struggle with multi-user interactions. A study extends a DST dataset to include a second user's utterances, revealing a performance drop in multi-user settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' robustness in multi-user DST and address the gap in real-world multi-user interaction complexity.

Method: Extend an existing DST dataset by generating a second user's utterances using speech act theory, then evaluate LLMs in this multi-user setting.

Result: LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop in multi-user DST compared to single-user scenarios.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robustness for multi-user DST, highlighting the need for future research to improve their performance in such settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Resa introduces SAE-Tuning, a cost-effective method to enhance reasoning in language models, achieving high performance with minimal training cost and time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently elicit strong reasoning abilities in language models without expensive training or reasoning traces.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) to capture reasoning abilities from a source model and guide fine-tuning in a target model.

Result: Achieves >97% of RL-trained performance at 2000x lower cost and 450x faster training. Enables high reasoning performance (e.g., 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24) for ~$1.

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning is efficient, generalizable, and modular, offering scalable reasoning enhancement with minimal resources.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The RRP framework enhances LLMs by integrating knowledge graphs to refine reasoning paths, improving performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of background knowledge and hallucinations. Integrating KGs can help, but existing methods fail to handle complex questions by not refining fact relationships.

Method: Proposes RRP, combining LLM semantics with KG structural info via relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning, plus a rethinking module to evaluate paths.

Result: RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets and can be easily integrated into LLMs.

Conclusion: RRP effectively enhances LLM reasoning by generating high-quality, tailored reasoning paths.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: An unsupervised hybrid method combining data-driven inference and rule-based heuristics for reconstructing protoforms, outperforming baselines in accuracy and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely heavily on data-driven probabilistic models, limiting their effectiveness. This work aims to integrate linguistic constraints for better protoform reconstruction.

Result: Substantial improvements over baselines in reconstructing Latin protoforms, measured by character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility.

Conclusion: The hybrid method effectively integrates data-driven and rule-based approaches, enhancing protoform reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI tutors' ability to identify mistakes in student math reasoning, improving pedagogical feedback.

Method: Four approaches: ensemble of ML models, frozen sentence-transformer, history-aware model, and retrieval-augmented LLM prompting.

Result: The retrieval-augmented LLM system outperformed all baselines.

Conclusion: Combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning is effective for pedagogical feedback assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with complex character-level tasks despite high spelling accuracy, relying on deeper Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during spelling, given their limitations in handling complex character tasks.

Method: Analyzed LLMs' spelling behavior through probing classifiers, knowledge neuron identification, and attention weight inspection.

Result: Embedding layers inadequately encode character-level info; deeper layers show a 'breakthrough' in reconstructing this knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs rely on intermediate and higher layers for character-level tasks, revealing a non-straightforward internal processing mechanism.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

*Thanh Thi Nguyen,Campbell Wilson,Janis Dalins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using large language models (LLMs) like Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 to detect life-threatening language, outperforming traditional methods. Mistral and Llama-2 excel, while upsampling helps traditional methods but not LLMs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of life-threatening language for mental health and safety, comparing LLMs with traditional methods.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, Llama-2) on balanced, imbalanced, and extremely imbalanced datasets, and comparing them to traditional techniques like bag of words and BERT.

Result: LLMs, especially Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods in all data scenarios. Upsampling aids traditional methods but has minimal impact on LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for real-world life-threatening language detection, with Mistral and Llama-2 leading in performance.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the Open English Wordnet by filling missing hypernymy links for adjectives, which are less studied compared to nouns and verbs.

Method: Theoretical discussion of adjective hypernymy, development of a new resource, and fine-tuning large language models (TaxoLLaMa adaptation).

Result: Successful adaptation of TaxoLLaMa methodology to predict adjective hypernymy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in adjective hypernymy links, demonstrating adaptability of existing methods.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of

### [251] [PREMISE: Scalable and Strategic Prompt Optimization for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning in Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10716)
*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE reduces token usage and cost in large reasoning models (LRMs) by optimizing prompts for brevity and correctness without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs produce verbose reasoning traces, inflating token usage and cost, which limits deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings.

Method: PREMISE uses trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving accuracy. It balances token length and answer validity through a multi-objective textual search.

Result: On benchmarks (GSM8K, SVAMP, Math500), PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting cost by 69-82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable way to improve LRM efficiency without compromising reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

### [252] [Beyond True or False: Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical Analysis of Nuanced Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10728)
*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimSpect is a framework for breaking down nuanced claims into hierarchical aspects and sub-aspects, enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives, and validating them systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuanced claims (e.g., scientific or political) often lack clear true/false labels, requiring a structured approach to validate individual aspects.

Method: Proposes ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based framework that hierarchically partitions claims into aspects, retrieves relevant corpus segments, and identifies perspectives.

Result: Applied to real-world claims, ClaimSpect effectively deconstructs nuanced claims and represents corpus perspectives, outperforming baselines in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect provides a comprehensive, structured approach to analyzing nuanced claims, validated through case studies and human evaluation.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Nan Zhang,Yunyi Zhang,Rui Zhang,Prasenjit Mitra,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt is a framework for dynamically adapting LLM-generated taxonomies to scientific corpora, addressing gaps in generalizability and multidimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature due to evolving fields and limitations of existing methods.

Method: TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding taxonomy width and depth based on corpus topical distribution.

Result: TaxoAdapt outperforms baselines, generating taxonomies 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt effectively structures and captures the evolution of scientific fields, offering a robust solution for taxonomy construction.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

TL;DR: Using a universal tokenizer during pretraining improves language adaptation for new languages post-training, with up to 20.2% higher win rates, without major performance loss on pretraining languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multilingual LLM pretraining, such as limited model capacity, data scarcity, and tokenizer language gaps, to enhance post-training language adaptation.

Method: Proposing a universal tokenizer trained for more languages than the primary pretraining set to improve language plasticity and adaptation capabilities.

Result: Universal tokenizer boosts adaptation by up to 20.2% for new languages and 5% for unseen languages, with minimal impact on pretraining language performance.

Conclusion: A universal tokenizer is a cost-effective early intervention to enhance multilingual LLM adaptability to new languages post-training.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Motivation: Accurate uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying LLMs in high-stakes clinical domains to ensure reliable decision support.

Method: Fine-grained evaluation of ten open-source LLMs across two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types, comparing standard and sampling-based uncertainty estimation methods.

Result: Lightweight, single-pass methods perform comparably to Semantic Entropy, with significant performance variation across specialties and question types.

Conclusion: Model selection should consider question nature and model-specific strengths, emphasizing the need for tailored uncertainty estimation in clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

TL;DR: A method using LLM revision improves ASR accuracy for named entities, reducing WER by 30% on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are critical but often misrecognized by ASR systems, impacting downstream applications.

Method: Uses LLM revision with reasoning and local context (e.g., lecture notes) to correct named entities in ASR predictions.

Result: Achieves up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based revision effectively enhances ASR performance for named entities, validated by a new dataset.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit is a framework for updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs without interference, using null-space constraints to isolate language-specific updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs efficiently while avoiding destructive parameter interference across languages.

Method: LangEdit projects parameter updates for each language onto orthogonal subspaces to ensure independence and preserve multilingual generalization.

Result: LangEdit outperforms existing methods, mitigating interference and maintaining accuracy across three model architectures, six languages, and four tasks.

Conclusion: LangEdit enables efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: ReCUT is a novel method to balance reasoning accuracy and length in LLMs, reducing reasoning traces by 30-50% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing overthinking and redundancy in Chain-of-Thought prompting for LLMs, which existing methods struggle with due to data quality and overfitting.

Method: ReCUT uses stepwise exploration, long-short switched sampling, and trains two specialized models (for accuracy and brevity), then interpolates their parameters.

Result: ReCUT reduces reasoning lengths by 30-50% while maintaining or improving accuracy across math reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ReCUT effectively balances reasoning accuracy and brevity, outperforming baselines, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlowFast Sampling is a dynamic strategy for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) that alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding, improving efficiency and flexibility. It achieves significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for dLLMs are static, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility. SlowFast Sampling aims to address these limitations by dynamically adapting decoding stages.

Method: The method introduces SlowFast Sampling, guided by three principles (certainty, convergence, positional), and integrates with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: Experiments show up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA and 34.22× with caching, outperforming autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling can unlock dLLMs' potential for fast, high-quality generation, making SlowFast Sampling a promising approach.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how wav2vec2 models trained on four languages encode speech features like phones, tones, and speakers, showing their subspaces are orthogonal and representation structure is language-independent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how self-supervised speech models (wav2vec2) represent speech features across different languages, beyond just English.

Method: Probing classifiers and geometric analyses are used to examine phone, tone, and speaker representations in wav2vec2 models trained on four languages.

Result: Subspaces for phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, with similar layerwise patterns across languages and a slight advantage for matched-language phone and tone probes in later layers.

Conclusion: The structure of wav2vec2's learned representations is largely independent of the pretraining language, suggesting universal encoding patterns.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

TL;DR: MedRef is a medical dialogue system that improves response accuracy by refining knowledge and dynamically adjusting prompts, outperforming existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems struggle with identifying relevant knowledge and generating personalized, accurate responses.

Method: MedRef uses knowledge refining and dynamic prompt adjustment, including Triplet Filter and Demo Selector modules, to enhance response quality.

Result: MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks in generation quality and medical entity accuracy.

Conclusion: MedRef is effective and reliable for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning with LoRA and QLoRA improves task-specific performance in LLMs efficiently, with performance linked to dataset-task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the impact of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA) on large language model performance across reasoning and knowledge tasks.

Method: Evaluated LoRA and QLoRA on commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).

Result: LoRA methods enhance task-specific performance efficiently; performance depends on dataset-task alignment.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large
language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and
QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

### [264] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the dual behavior of LLMs in generalizing and hallucinating, attributing it to out-of-context reasoning (OCR), and formalizes OCR with theoretical and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit both generalization and hallucination during fine-tuning, focusing on the role of OCR.

Method: Experiments across five LLMs, formalizing OCR as a synthetic factual recall task, and analyzing a one-layer transformer model.

Result: OCR drives both behaviors; matrix factorization is crucial, and gradient descent's implicit bias explains the phenomenon.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for OCR, aiding in analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioClinical ModernBERT is a domain-adapted encoder for biomedical and clinical NLP, improving speed and performance through large-scale pretraining and diverse dataset integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder-based transformer models lag in development compared to decoders, limiting domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical NLP.

Method: Developed through continued pretraining on a 53.5B-token corpus and leveraging 20 diverse datasets for robustness.

Result: Outperforms existing encoders on four downstream tasks, with base and large versions released.

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT advances biomedical and clinical NLP, offering improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

### [266] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automatic evaluation method for autoformalization in formal mathematics using an LLM-based ensemble (EFG) to assess nuanced dimensions like logical preservation and formal quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoformalization evaluation methods are coarse-grained and lack effectiveness for advanced formal mathematics, requiring scalable and nuanced alternatives.

Method: Proposes an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, evaluating criteria like logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.

Result: EFG ensemble correlates more strongly with human assessments than coarse-grained models, especially in formal quality evaluation.

Conclusion: LLM-as-judges, guided by atomic properties, can provide scalable, interpretable, and reliable evaluation for formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

TL;DR: Magistral is Mistral's first reasoning model, trained using a scalable RL pipeline, demonstrating improved capabilities in reasoning, multimodal understanding, and function calling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the limits of pure RL training for LLMs and develop a ground-up approach without relying on prior models or implementations.

Method: A scalable RL pipeline was used, focusing on text data alone, with a method to enforce reasoning language. Magistral Medium was trained on Mistral Medium 3, and Magistral Small was open-sourced with additional cold-start data.

Result: RL on text maintained or improved multimodal understanding, instruction following, and function calling.

Conclusion: Magistral demonstrates the effectiveness of pure RL training for LLMs, with open-sourcing of Magistral Small to encourage further research.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable
reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing
implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data
from Magistral Medium.

### [268] [Decomposing MLP Activations into Interpretable Features via Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10920)
*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations in LLMs, outperforming sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpretability and causal steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like SAEs lack intrinsic interpretability and struggle in causal evaluations, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The authors use SNMF to decompose MLP activations, ensuring features are sparse linear combinations of neurons and mapped to inputs for direct interpretability.

Result: SNMF-derived features outperform SAEs and a supervised baseline in causal steering and align with human-interpretable concepts, revealing hierarchical structures in activation space.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'dynamic epistemic friction' to describe resistance in belief updates during human-AI collaboration, using Dynamic Epistemic Logic to model and predict belief alignment in dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the neglect of epistemic friction in aligning LLMs with human preferences, which is crucial for effective belief updates in collaborative tasks.

Method: Define dynamic epistemic friction within Dynamic Epistemic Logic, analyze belief updates in dialogues, and refine the model for real-world complexity.

Result: The model effectively predicts belief updates in dialogues and can be adapted for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic epistemic friction provides a valuable framework for understanding and improving belief alignment in human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec decomposes datasets into meta-domains, enabling optimal data mixture for LM pretraining without training, improving efficiency and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture key dataset features and align training-validation distributions for better LM performance with minimal computational cost.

Method: Decomposes datasets into meta-domains using a classifier, forming domain vectors for data mixture optimization under the DA² assumption.

Result: Achieves same validation loss with 51.5% computation and improves downstream performance by 2.83% under equivalent compute budget.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec efficiently enhances LM pretraining and downstream task performance by optimizing data mixtures.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing harmful content detection resources are mainly English-focused, leaving Chinese datasets scarce and limited. This work aims to fill this gap.

Method: A professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection is created, covering six categories. A knowledge-augmented baseline integrates human-annotated rules and LLM knowledge.

Result: The proposed method enables smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The benchmark and knowledge-augmented approach advance Chinese harmful content detection, providing valuable resources and methods for the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind is an adaptive LLM-agent framework for automated data science, improving on rigid existing methods with expert knowledge, strategic search, and dynamic coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents are limited by inflexible workflows and lack of empirical expertise, hindering performance on complex tasks.

Method: AutoMind introduces (1) a curated expert knowledge base, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy.

Result: AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in benchmarks, showing superior effectiveness, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a robust step toward fully automated data science by addressing key limitations of current frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models can identify unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from them, especially larger models. Self-reevaluation needs improvement for better reasoning and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how effectively reasoning models can self-reevaluate and recover from unhelpful thoughts.

Method: Examined models' ability to identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts, including irrelevant or misleading ones.

Result: Models identify most unhelpful thoughts but fail to recover, with larger models struggling more. Smaller models are less distracted by harmful thoughts.

Conclusion: Improvements in self-reevaluation are needed for better reasoning and safer AI systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.
